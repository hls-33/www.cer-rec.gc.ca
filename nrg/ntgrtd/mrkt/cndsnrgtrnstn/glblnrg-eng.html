                    A <strong>watt</strong> is a unit of power equal to one
                    joule per second. Similar to joules, watts are also
                    expressed as a multiple, such as megawatts (MW), gigawatts
                    (GW), and terawatts (TW). A typical on-shore wind turbine
                    has a capacity of around two to four&nbsp;MW, the
                    Robert-Bourassa hydro station has a capacity of 5.6&nbsp;GW,
                    and the Bruce Power Generating Station has a capacity of

                Global energy use has grown substantially over the last
                50&nbsp;years. Technological improvements since the early 20<sup

                century have resulted in the discovery and eventual use of new
                forms of energy. Use of energy sources such as coal shifted from
                transportation (for example, in steam locomotives), space
                heating, and industrial processes to use in electricity
                generation. Developments in marine shipping—including speed,
                efficiency, and economies of scale<sup id="fn8-rf"
                  ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"

                &ndash; resulted in the establishment of a global crude oil
                trade. Developments in the liquefaction of gasses, in
                combination with shipping developments, later resulted in the
                establishment of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade.
                This movement of energy around the globe allowed, and continues
                to allow, energy resource-poor societies to develop and grow
                their economies. To illustrate the impact that the global energy
                trade can have on an economy, natural gas from LNG now accounts
                for the source of almost 50% of Japan&rsquo;s electricity
                production mix.<sup id="fn9-rf"

                This rapid growth in the production and global trade of crude
                oil and natural gas also allows nations wealthy in energy
                resources to monetize their resources and build their economies,
                and enables nations poor in energy resources to import the fuels
                required to build modern, developed societies. This abundant
                supply of energy, coupled with continually growing demand,
                resulted in the continual growth of global energy consumption.
                In 2017, global energy consumption reached a record high 566
                exajoules (EJ).
              </p>
              <p>
                Global energy use and economic growth is highly unbalanced.
                Historically, developed nations (nations who are members of the
                OECD) were the largest consumers of energy in absolute terms.
                However, developing (or &ldquo;non-OECD&rdquo;) nations became
                the largest consumers of energy after 2007. This change came as
                a result of industrialization, motorization, economic reforms,
                urbanization, and other structural transformations that occurred
                in many of these developing nations in recent decades. This is
                illustrated in Figure&nbsp;2.
              </p>
              <p>
                As economic and population growth in developing nations
                continues to surpass growth in developed nations, energy demand
                growth in developing nations is expected to continue outpacing
                energy demand growth in developed nations.

              <h3>Why Transition?</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to a strong link between energy use and social and
                economic development, there is also a strong link between energy
                use and the environment. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a
                GHG that results from the combustion of biomass and fossil
                fuels. GHGs also result from the conversion of land from natural
                vegetation to urban, industrial, or cultivated land. GHGs are

                  >main cause of climate change</a
                >, and the shift from carbon-emitting fuels towards
                non-carbon-emitting fuels is what defines the current energy
                transition.

                Not all carbon-based fuels are equal. Different fuels contain
                different amounts of energy and consequently, have differing

                  These two graphs illustrate global primary energy consumption
                  by fuel type between 1850 and 2017. The area graph shows the
                  growth in primary energy consumed, from 11&nbsp;EJ in 1850 to
                  580&nbsp;EJ in 2017.

                  The line graph illustrates the share of total primary energy
                  consumed by fuel between 1850 and 2017. In 1850, wood and
                  biomass provided over 80% of the world’s energy needs while
                  coal provided the majority of the remainder. By 2017, wood and
                  biomass provided less than 5% of the world’s energy needs
                  while coal’s share was 27%. The remaining shares of primary
                  energy consumed in 2017 were crude oil at 32%, natural gas at
                  23%, hydroelectric at 7%, nuclear at 4%, and non-hydro
                  renewables at 3%.

              <p>
                Figure&nbsp;3 illustrates a 167&nbsp;year global history of
                energy consumption by fuel. Since the 1950s, the majority of
                growing global energy needs have been met using carbon-emitting
                fuels (biomass, coal, crude oil, natural gas). Currently,
                carbon-based fuels account for 85% of the world&rsquo;s primary
                energy needs. Non-emitting sources, such as hydroelectricity,
                nuclear, wind, and solar have historically accounted for only a
                small percentage of the primary energy consumed globally.
              </p>
              <p>
                The global economy&rsquo;s growing demand for energy,
                particularly from abundant and affordable carbon-emitting fuels,
                has resulted in global GHG emissions reaching new heights with
                each year. Between 1850 and 2014, GHG emissions grew from an
                estimated 198 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent<sup

                  This combined stacked column and line graph illustrates total
                  global GHG emissions, and Canada’s share of global GHG
                  emissions, from 1990 to 2014. From 2000 to 2014, total global
                  GHG emissions increased from 29 151&nbsp;MT of CO<sub>2</sub>e
                  to 44 204&nbsp;MT. Canada’s share of global emissions have
                  decreased from 2.1% to 1.7%, though Canada’s emissions

                Figure&nbsp;4 illustrates the trend in GHG emissions between

                increased 33% to 745&nbsp;MT of CO<sub>2</sub>e. Though Canada
                remains a relatively small contributor to global GHG emissions,
                Canada is one of the most emission-intensive nations in the
                world. This will be explored more in the next section.

              <h3>The Current Transition</h3>
              <p>
                Figure&nbsp;3 also illustrates that energy transitions,
                historically, have occurred slowly. Prior to 1880, biomass was
                the largest source of primary energy globally. Coal, a major
                driver of the Industrial Revolution, was more abundant and less
                labour intensive than wood/charcoal. Coal&rsquo;s share as a
                primary energy continued to grow as a source of fuel, and peaked
                in the 1910s when it met 70% of the world&rsquo;s energy needs.
                While the use of coal grew five-fold over the next century,
                coal&rsquo;s share as a primary energy source declined to 28% in
                the 2010s. Starting in the 1930s, global energy needs were being
                met through increasingly abundant and affordable hydrocarbons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nuclear energy, first used for electricity generation in the
                1950s, has accounted for 4% to 6% of global primary energy
                demand since the mid-1980s.<sup id="fn14-rf"

                  ></sup
                >
                As of 2016, there were 450 nuclear reactors operating world-wide
                and another 60 under construction.<sup id="fn15-rf"
                  ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15"

              </p>
              <p>
                A fundamental component of the current energy transition is
                increased energy from renewables. Figure&nbsp;3 illustrates that
                energy from non-hydro renewables, such as wind and solar, has
                increased from 2&nbsp;EJ in 2000 to 20&nbsp;EJ in 2017. This may
                seem small, but it is worth noting that no other primary energy
                source has experienced a ten-fold increase in growth, or has
                grown in share by that amount in a 17-year timeframe. The growth
                in non-hydro renewable use is similar to the rise of nuclear in
                the 1970s and 1980s and many international energy forecasting
                agencies<sup id="fn16-rf"

                  ></sup
                >
                see the share of renewables continuing to grow into the future.
                Advancements in technology and improvements in economics have
                resulted in non-hydro renewables competing with traditional
                energy systems on a cost per energy generated basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                What Figure&nbsp;3 does not illustrate is the pace at which
                individual economies transition from one energy source to
                another. Historically, not all societies have transitioned at
                the same speed, or with the same magnitude. Coal, despite being
                inferior to oil and natural gas in terms of energy density,
                still remains an abundant and affordable source of primary
                energy for many developing and developed nations. Biomass use
                &ndash; higher now than in 1900 &ndash; continues to be used as
                a cooking fuel

                <p><strong>FROM KYOTO TO PARIS</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The Paris Agreement is similar to the Kyoto Protocol in that
                  both build on the goals set out in the UNFCCC, and were
                  developed with the aim of curbing the rise of global
                  temperatures through a reduction in GHG emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005 with 192 parties
                  signing on, including Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Canada’s Kyoto target was a 6% reduction below its 1990
                  emissions by 2012. However, by 2010, Canada’s emissions had
                  increased 15% from 1990 levels. In 2012, realising it was
                  unable to meet its commitments, Canada withdrew from the
                  agreement.

                  The Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015 and entered into force
                  in 2016. Paris differed from Kyoto because instead of
                  internationally binding emissions targets, countries set
                  voluntary, nationally determined targets. The targets are
                  expected to represent best efforts and are to be strengthened
                  over time. As well, under the Paris Agreement, both developed
                  and developing countries are required to set emissions
                  reductions targets. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol only
                  requires targets to be set by developed nations with
                  developing nations given the opportunity to voluntarily
                  comply.

                The rapid increase in energy-related GHG emissions and the
                effects of these emissions on the climate are the underpinning
                of national governments reaching agreements to take action.
                Typically, these agreements involve governments adopting
                policies designed to change the behaviours of consumers and
                producers.

                International policies have been the impetus for change, and

                is one such international treaty that Canada was party to.
                Finalized in 1987 and implemented in 1989, the Montreal Protocol
                resulted in the phasing out of substances that deplete of the
                ozone layer (primarily chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs). In addition
                to being the first environmental agreement to achieve universal
                ratification by all countries, the agreement is

                common environmental goal was in fact possible. Three decades
                later, the Montreal Protocol became an instrument against

                In 1992, the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate
                Change (<a rel="external" href="https://unfccc.int/">UNFCCC</a>)
                was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil by
                154&nbsp;signatories. It has since been ratified by 197
                countries. The treaty set out a goal to stabilize GHG
                concentrations “at a level that would prevent dangerous
                anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Under the
                UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol (1997) was the first agreement to set
                emissions reductions targets, though only for a limited number
                of parties.<sup id="fn19-rf"

                The central goal of the Paris Agreement, which includes
                emissions reduction commitments by a much larger group of
                parties than the Kyoto Protocol, is to keep the global
                temperature increase to well below 2º Celsius above
                pre-industrial levels this century, and to pursue efforts to
                limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5º Celsius
                above pre-industrial levels.

                As the effects and the costs of climate change increase, the
                push for action on climate change has also increased. This has
                resulted in the current energy transition being the first
                transition where environmental factors are a primary driver of
                the transition. The transition is being further supported by
                technological, economic, and political factors.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Canada’s commitment under the Paris Agreement involves a 30%
                reduction of its GHG emissions from 2005 levels (730 MT of
                CO<sub>2</sub>e) by 2030, which equates to a target of 511 MT.
                Canada’s emissions in 2017 were 716 MT, which represents a net
                decrease of 1.9% from 2005 levels. On a per capita basis, GHG
                emissions have declined from 22.7&nbsp;tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e
                per person to 19.5&nbsp;tonnes per person, a net decrease of

                Placing a price on carbon pollution is central to the Framework.
                Carbon pricing is an efficient way to reduce emissions, drive
                innovation, and encourage people and businesses to pollute
                less.<sup id="fn23-rf"

                In addition to placing a price on carbon pollution, the
                Pan-Canadian Framework also includes complementary actions that
                aim to reduce emissions by addressing market barriers where
                pricing alone is insufficient or not timely enough to reduce
                emissions in the pre-2030 timeframe. These actions, for example,
                include increasing the stringency of energy efficiency standards
                and codes for vehicles and buildings. The Pan-Canadian Framework
                also includes actions to help Canadians adapt and become more
                resilient to the effects of a changing climate and foster clean
                technology solutions.

                A carbon price places a cost on activities that result in GHG
                emissions. In practice, a government can impose a fixed charge
                based on actual emissions, based on the embedded carbon in fuel,
                or based on the carbon emitted to produce a product. Therefore,
                the more an individual or organization emits, the more they pay.
                Carbon pricing is transparent and predictable and provide an
                incentive for energy efficiency and emissions reductions
                innovations. Decisions about how to return the revenue from
                carbon pricing can have important impacts, including helping
                alleviate any regressive effects and further supporting research
                and development or investments in energy efficiency.<sup

              <p>
                Emissions permit trading and cap-and-trade systems operate
                differently from a tax, though the objective of reducing
                emissions remains the same. Under permit trading, governments
                can set a limit on GHG emissions and issue a fixed number of
                permits equal to the cap. The trade component allows for
                polluters to trade permits with other polluters. This trading
                mechanism allows for polluters who can decrease their emissions
                most cheaply to sell and profit from the sale of their permits
                to other polluters who need to increase their emissions or are
                unable to reduce cost effectively. When governments reduce the
                cap over time, it is possible to reduce total emissions while
                creating an incentive to drive lower cost-emissions reductions
                first.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main benefits of permit trading are the certainty of
                reductions and the ability to link with other permit trading
                systems in other jurisdictions. The drawbacks of permit trading
                are higher administrative costs and price uncertainty for
                emitters.
              </p>
              <h3>Other Policy Tools</h3>
              <p>
                As recognized by governments party to the Pan-Canadian
                Framework, multiple actions will be needed in addition to carbon
                pricing for Canada to reach its 2030 Paris Agreement target and
                to continue to further decarbonize its economy by mid-century.
                In the move towards electrification and clean energy,
                significant investments will be required, as well as a deeper
                understanding by end-users as to how we produce and use energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Complementing market-based instruments are a variety of other
                policies that contribute to reducing emissions. These policies
                and regulations typically work by encouraging or discouraging
                behaviours through non-monetary means. These include, but are
                not limited to: policies and regulations related to improved
                practices and standards, investments in research and development
                for energy efficiency and clean technology, and electricity
                sector initiatives (such as renewable portfolio standards and
                coal phase-outs).
              </p>
              <p>
                Policies are an important part of energy trends. As Canada’s
                energy systems evolve, it will continue to be guided by policy
                decisions. Furthermore, given the long lifespans of
                energy-consuming equipment and projects, current policy
                developments will play a large role in future trends.

                      In the late 1940s, the largest crude carrier had a
                      capacity of 30&nbsp;000 deadweight tonnes (DWT) &ndash; a
                      capacity that was limited by the Suez Canal at the time.

                      Japan is highly reliant on the import of coal, crude oil,
                      and natural gas to meet the energy needs of its

                      in 2011, Japan progressively shut down its nuclear
                      reactors for safety reasons. While several reactors have
                      restarted, the majority remain shut down indefinitely.
                      Increased imports of LNG were instrumental in ensuring the
                      reliability of Japan&rsquo;s electricity sector following
                      the shutdowns.

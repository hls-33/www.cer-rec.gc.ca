          <p>
            The National Energy Board has as part of its mandate, the
            responsibility to monitor energy markets. Under this mandate, the
            Board issues reports on energy matters to inform Canadians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Canadian end-use energy prices have generally risen over the last
            decade and become more volatile. This Energy Fact will explore
            pricing trends over the past decade for crude oil, gasoline, furnace
            oil, natural gas, and electricity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Short-term analyses of these commodities can also be found on the
            Board&rsquo;s website under Energy Pricing Information for Canadian
            Consumers at
            <em>Energy Pricing Information for Canadian Consumers</em>.
          </p>
          <h2>Crude oil, Gasoline and Furnace Oil</h2>
          <h3><em>Crude Oil</em></h3>
          <p>
            Canada is a participant in the global oil market in which buyers and
            sellers trade volumes, mostly based on short-term contracts. This
            interaction sets the world price of oil. Although Canada is the
            sixth largest producer in the world, it produces only about
            four&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total daily production, so it has little
            influence on the world price of oil. As a result, Canada is a price
            taker, rather than a price setter. The price of crude oil is most
            commonly quoted in $US per barrel.

          <p>
            A brief overview of price developments over the 2000-2010 timeframe
            follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              2000-2003: During this period, WTI prices were stable, generally
              trading in the area of $30 per barrel. Contributing factors
              included ample OPEC spare producing capacity and weak economic
              growth and oil demand following the events of
              September&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2001.
            </li>
            <li>
              2004-2006: Prices began to rise, due in large part to increasing
              demand from China and other emerging economies. Spurred by
              attractive returns, financial investment in oil also began to
              increase. Prices increased in 29 of the 40&nbsp;months between
              September&nbsp;2003 and December&nbsp;2006.
            </li>
            <li>
              2007-2008: This period was characterized by extreme price
              volatility. Major contributing factors included ongoing
              significant growth in financial investment in oil; a falling U.S.
              dollar; growing demand from emerging economies; geopolitical
              instability; rising finding and development costs; and, slow
              non-OPEC production growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              2008-2010: The global recession was characterized by broad-based
              wealth destruction with the collapse of the U.S. housing market,
              the failure of a number of major financial institutions and the
              decline in stock markets. Commodity markets also fell. Oil demand
              was heavily impacted and WTI prices dropped from a high of over
              US$145 in July&nbsp;2008, to below US$40 per barrel by year-end.
              Through&nbsp;2009 and&nbsp;2010, oil prices began to increase with
              an improving global economy and reduced OPEC supply.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3><em>Petroleum Products</em></h3>
          <p>
            Petroleum Products Petroleum product pricing is primarily determined
            by crude oil pricing. The downstream petroleum sector is complex and
            highly competitive. Each petroleum product in each regional market
            reacts to a different set of supply/demand and transportation
            pressures and prices are set by both international and local market
            factors. As the physical distance from refinery to consumer
            point-of-sale increases, prices can be expected to be higher because
            of transportation costs. In addition, in rural areas where fewer
            retailers exist and competition is somewhat less intensive, prices
            would also tend to be higher than in larger centres. Differences in
            taxation are also a factor in regional price differences.

            Furnace oil, also known as heating oil, is used in about
            10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of homes in Canada. Sales of furnace oil are
            concentrated in eastern Canada with Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic
            Canada accounting for about 95&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total sales.
            Although Ontario and Quebec account for about two-thirds of Canadian
            demand, the Atlantic region is the most reliant on furnace oil for
            space heating.

          <h3><em>Summary</em></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Canada is a participant in the global market for crude oil. Over
              the past decade, the world oil market has become more volatile and
              prices have increased due mainly to higher costs of production,
              and increasing demand particularly from emerging economies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Crude oil input costs are the chief determinant of petroleum
              product prices. Over the past decade, higher and more volatile oil
              prices have resulted in Canadians facing higher prices for
              gasoline and furnace oil across the country, both on a nominal and
              inflation adjusted basis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h3><em>Natural Gas</em></h3>
          <p>
            Natural gas markets in Canada and the United States operate as
            single integrated market. Events relating to weather, storage,
            transportation or infrastructure, however, have a direct impact on
            markets in many regions of North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            The price of North American natural gas consists of three
            components: the cost of the natural gas (known as the commodity
            cost), the pipeline transportation cost and the distribution cost.
            The North American price of natural gas tended to move with the
            price of oil up until&nbsp;2008. However, since then, neither global
            trade nor the price of oil has been a major factor in determining
            North American natural gas prices. Although North America imports
            liquefied natural gas, it represents less than two percent of total
            supply and so does not greatly influence natural gas prices.

            The following section provides a brief overview of natural gas
            prices over the 2000-2010 timeframe.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              2000-2001: During this period, the first price spike occurred
              because of the California Energy Crisis. A shortage of electricity
              and natural gas pipeline shutdowns were responsible for the
              increase in gas prices.
            </li>
            <li>
              2002-2004: Natural gas prices increased slightly year-over-year,
              but did not reach the levels seen in&nbsp;2001. Prices did spike
              for a short period near the end of&nbsp;2004 as cold weather swept
              across the continent.
            </li>
            <li>
              2005: Hurricanes and volatile weather were responsible for price
              spikes. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaged offshore natural gas
              rigs in the Gulf of Mexico causing prices to exceed $14/MMBtu.
            </li>
            <li>
              2006-2008: This period was characterized by extreme volatility.
              Prices declined in&nbsp;2006 and mild temperatures and increased
              drilling contributed to relative price stability through mid-2008.
              The second half of&nbsp;2008, however, saw prices increase along
              with the price of crude oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              2008-2010: Increased shale gas production in the United States
              combined with the global recession kept natural gas prices below
              mid-decade levels through to the end of&nbsp;2010.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Prices of natural gas to the end consumer in Canada have moved in
            response to fluctuations in the commodity cost. Figure&nbsp;7 shows
            the average Canadian prices of natural gas to residential consumers,
            including taxes. As commodity costs fell in&nbsp;2010, so did gas
            costs to end-use consumers in Canada.

          </p>
          <p>
            Figure&nbsp;8 shows the annual average total cost of natural gas for
            six Canadian cities. Figures include fixed costs (costs charged to
            customers regardless of gas consumption, which include
            transportation and distribution costs) as well as GST and provincial
            taxes. Over the past 10&nbsp;years, total costs for natural gas have
            fluctuated mainly due to changes in the commodity cost. In general,
            cities closest to natural gas supply see lower prices.
            Since&nbsp;2000, Calgary has had the lowest total cost for natural
            gas while Halifax has had the highest total cost. Overall, costs for
            natural gas for residential customers fell in&nbsp;2010.

            Total prices for natural gas in eastern Canada remain higher than
            western Canada, as markets in Ontario and Quebec rely on gas coming
            from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and therefore
            transportation costs are higher. Markets in Atlantic Canada are able
            to access natural gas from the Sable offshore project; however,
            these markets are smaller and less mature therefore distribution
            costs are higher. Over the ten-year period, for consumers in
            Vancouver and Calgary, close to 60&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of their total
            bill was comprised of transportation and distribution, while
            consumers in Toronto and Halifax paid close to
            70&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.

          <h3><em>Summary</em></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Canadian natural gas market operates in the context of the
              greater North American market. Over the past 10&nbsp;years,
              natural gas prices have fluctuated based on seasonal effects and
              supply constraints. The significant emergence of shale gas
              production beginning&nbsp;2008 has resulted in the commodity cost
              of natural gas declining to 2003&nbsp;levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prices for natural gas including transportation and delivery vary
              across the country, in general with mature markets closest to
              natural gas supplies seeing the lowest end-use costs. Of the
              selected major cities reviewed for the period, end-use prices were
              lowest in Calgary and highest in Halifax.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h3><em>Electricity</em></h3>
          <p>
            While oil markets are global and natural gas markets are generally
            continental, electricity markets are regional. Electricity prices
            vary by province or territory, primarily according to the type of
            available generation and the market structure (i.e. market-based or
            cost-of-service regulation). In general, the provinces that have
            large amounts of hydroelectric power have lower costs and have had
            less incentive to restructure their markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the consumer level, electricity is typically priced per
            kilowatt-hour (kW.h) of consumption, with various service charges
            (mostly to cover the cost of transmission and distribution) added as
            fixed charges. Prices in most provinces and territories are set by
            the electricity regulator to cover costs and allow for a reasonable
            rate of return to investors. Ontario has chosen to partially
            restructure its electricity market, allowing market forces to
            determine a portion of the generation costs. Alberta, being a
            province largely dependent on thermal generation, has moved the
            furthest in restructuring its electricity market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consumer prices for electricity are mainly made up of the costs of
            electricity generation, transmission and distribution. In Alberta
            and Ontario, the cost of generation is determined in the wholesale
            markets, with Ontario administering a &quot;Global Adjustment&quot;
            to account for the regulated and contracted generation in the
            province. This Global Adjustment has risen in recent years as the
            wholesale market price has dropped below the average contracted
            price, and the amount of contracted generation is increasing.
            Figure&nbsp;9 shows prices in the Alberta and Ontario wholesale
            markets and key influencing factors from&nbsp;2000 to&nbsp;2010. The
            Ontario market tends to be less volatile than Alberta due to greater
            market size, more interconnections with other markets, and more
            regulated or contracted generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of July&nbsp;2010, the regulated residential rates in Alberta are
            entirely based on the electricity providers&rsquo; month-ahead
            costs. If the overall price level expectation for the next month
            changes, the prices that residents (who have not signed a retail
            contract) pay will change accordingly. Similarly, in Ontario, the
            regulated residential rates are determined twice each year by the
            Ontario Energy Board, and are set to reflect future cost
            expectations for all generation in the province. Ontario&rsquo;s
            &quot;regulated price plan&quot; differs from Alberta&rsquo;s
            &quot;regulated rate option&quot;, in that it is set less often and
            has one price for the province, whereas Alberta sets a different
            price for each provider.

              <strong>In November&nbsp;2002 Ontario froze retail prices</strong>

              paid to regulated and contracted generation with their portions of
              the variable rates determined in the wholesale market.<br />
              This can be a credit to consumers when the wholesale price is
              relatively high (as in&nbsp;2005) or conversely a charge to
              consumers (as in&nbsp;2009).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Ontario (2005-2010):</strong> Wholesale prices spike when
              high summer demand follows the April&nbsp;2005 closure of the
              Lakeview Coal Generating facility. The Ontario Power Authority
              signs contracts for new gas-fired generation and renewables,
              increasing the global adjustment's share of total system costs.
              Ontario demand and wholesale prices both decrease in&nbsp;2009.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Alberta (2005-2010):</strong> Reserve margins tighten as
              demand continues to grow. Periodic price spikes occur, typically
              caused by outages of low cost coal generation. A period of lower
              prices follows a lull in demand growth in&nbsp;2009. 2010 ends
              with rising prices due to significant reductions in coal-fired
              capacity.

            Large consumers (i.e., industrial and commercial) are typically
            provided power at lower rates than residential consumers. However,
            in Alberta and Ontario large consumers buy directly from the
            wholesale market, and are thus subject to more price volatility than
            small consumers. These large consumers tend to pay the real-time
            cost of generation, and thus have more incentive to consume power
            only when it is economical, such as in off-peak periods. The
            commodity costs in other provinces are based on cost-of-service
            regulation of their utilities, and the price level is largely
            dependent on the types of generation available. For example, Quebec,
            British Columbia and Manitoba have systems dominated by
            hydro-electric generation, which for the most part produce
            relatively low-cost power. Other jurisdictions, such as the Atlantic
            provinces, have more diversified systems that are affected by
            changes in fossil fuel costs. The Atlantic provinces have
            implemented 'fuel-adjustment mechanisms' that allow the regulated
            utilities to pass-through fuel costs on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            While prices have tended to increase in nominal terms across the
            country, inflation-adjusted residential costs have decreased in
            Manitoba and Quebec. Ontario has seen the most cost increases due to
            increased fuel costs, a commitment to use cleaner energy sources,
            and the need to reinforce its transmission system. Figure&nbsp;10
            shows residential consumer costs for selected cities.

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Electricity prices vary by province or territory, primarily
              according to the type of available generation and the market
              structure (i.e., market-based or cost-of-service regulation).
              Ontario and Alberta have restructured their electricity markets to
              a greater extent than the other provinces and territories.
            </li>
            <li>
              On average, Canadian residential electricity prices have increased
              somewhat over the review period. Price increases are less when
              adjusted for inflation and prices have declined in some provinces.
              The regions that have seen more substantial price increases
              include Alberta, Ontario and the Maritimes.

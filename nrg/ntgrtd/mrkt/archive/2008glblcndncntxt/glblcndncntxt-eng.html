            The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is an independent
            federal agency that regulates several aspects of Canada's energy
            industry. Its purpose is to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and efficient energy infrastructure and
            markets in the Canadian public interest<sup>[*]</sup> within the
            mandate set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
            development and trade. The Board's main responsibilities include
            regulating the construction and operation of interprovincial and
            international oil and gas pipelines as well as international and
            designated interprovincial power lines. The Board regulates pipeline
            tolls and tariffs for pipelines under its jurisdiction. In terms of
            specific energy commodities, the Board regulates the exports and
            imports of natural gas as well as exports of oil, natural gas
            liquids (NGLs) and electricity. Additionally, the Board regulates
            oil and gas exploration, development and production in Frontier
            lands and offshore areas not covered by provincial or federal
            management agreements. The Board's advisory function requires
            keeping under review matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction
            relating to all aspects of energy supply, transmission and disposal
            of energy in and outside Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB monitors energy markets to objectively analyze energy
            commodities and inform Canadians about trends, events, and issues.
            The Board releases numerous research reports. This report is a
            briefing note - a brief report covering one aspect of energy
            commodities. Specifically, this energy demand report considers
            recent global and Canadian context issues that influence more
            detailed regional and sector specific analysis.

          <h2 id="s2">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This briefing note introduces an upcoming series of notes on
            Canada's energy demand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The series will discuss current
            trends, technology, policy, regulations, and social issues, and will
            explore opportunities and potential for shifts in energy demand.
            Many Canadians are questioning the economic and environmental
            sustainability of the current trend of increasing energy
            consumption. In addition, a growing global preoccupation about
            energy and related environmental issues has prompted everyone from
            energy experts to the general public to question fundamental
            assumptions about energy supply and demand. Although not immediately
            obvious, energy demand is dynamic. The ultimate extent of this
            dynamic depends on context, and this includes everything from market
            forces to evolving personal attitudes towards energy use. This
            briefing note considers the major issues of global and national
            context in order to support future detailed study into specific
            demand topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a general consensus that the energy market has changed
            considerably since the release of the NEB's report titled
            <em>Canada's Energy Future</em> in November&nbsp;2007<sup>[1]</sup>.
            Our analysis at that time was based on the established trends and
            extensive consultations with energy experts in the early part
            of&nbsp;2007. For example, our Reference Case was based upon
            existing energy policies and a consensus view of a long-term
            international oil price of US$50/barrel. However, beginning
            in&nbsp;2007, there was a significant increase in energy prices such
            that oil prices averaged US$72/barrel. Canadian governments at all
            levels responded to public concerns and introduced policies to
            address climate change. There has been a notable shift in consumer
            preference for energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, and
            vehicles. These factors may indicate a change that could have
            long-term implications for Canada's domestic energy demand outlook.

            The recent volatility of energy pricing and world energy supply
            fears can distract from focussed discussion on regional energy
            issues. It also alters fundamental market assumptions behind the
            NEB's own supply and demand analysis. Petroleum is the world's
            most-traded energy commodity, and Canada is both a buyer and seller
            on world markets. Canada has a market-orientated energy policy.
            According to Natural Resources Canada, markets are the most
            efficient means of determining supply, demand, prices and trade
            while ensuring an efficient, competitive and innovative energy
            system that is responsive to Canada's energy needs<sup>[2]</sup>. As
            such, Canadian consumers are exposed to fluctuations in pricing.

          <p>
            Developing energy forecasts requires making many assumptions that
            will affect accuracy. Emerging technology, the rise and fall of
            world commodity prices, geopolitical conflict, and consumer
            behaviour and attitude changes all have a profound effect on energy
            demand trends. Energy projections are limited in their ability to
            anticipate major shifts in consumption at either a national or
            international level. The NEB regularly seeks input from national and
            international energy experts to support its assumptions. Although
            this briefing note series is essentially about energy demand in
            Canada, the overwhelming influence of global energy issues warrants
            some initial attention.

            World vehicle stock is predicted to double, growing from
            approximately 1&nbsp;billion today, to more than 2&nbsp;billion
            by&nbsp;2030. (IEA, World Energy Outlook 2007).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a growing perception that future energy demand will be
            dictated by the harsh realities of limited resources and high
            prices. Given that the International Energy Agency (IEA) reference
            scenario suggests world energy demand could grow 55&nbsp;percent
            by&nbsp;2030, and potentially double by&nbsp;2050, supply stresses
            are inevitable<sup>[3]</sup>. The projected growth is not uniform
            and there are wide regional variances. For example, last year
            China's primary energy demand increased 7.7&nbsp;percent. At the
            same time, primary energy consumption in the European Union actually
            decreased 2.2&nbsp;percent<sup>[4]</sup>. Changing fuel types or
            sources also complicate the analysis of global trend statistics. As
            an example, the IEA outlook predicts total global coal use to
            increase 73&nbsp;percent between&nbsp;2005 and&nbsp;2030. At the
            same time, announcements such as the phase-out of Ontario's coal
            generation plants by&nbsp;2014 and the large number of proposed new
            coal plants in the U.S. presently on-hold, due to uncertainty over
            climate change regulations, reveal the level of complexity and
            contradictory information behind such predictions.

            At a high level, the debate on future energy demand focuses largely
            on three main areas: energy supply/security, energy demand growth,
            and climate change. Each issue has multiple levels of complexity;
            however, an introduction to the issues and further considerations
            for analysis follows:

            The dominance of fossil fuels in the fuel mix to&nbsp;2030 is a
            consistent theme in global demand analysis. In the IEA scenarios,
            the range varies from 83&nbsp;percent (Reference Case) to
            76&nbsp;percent (Alternative Scenario). The Energy Information
            Agency (EIA) in the U.S. has recently released its projection of
            demand growth and fuel mix (Figure&nbsp;1). It also indicates a
            continuing reliance of fossil fuel use through to
            2030<sup>[5]</sup>.

            Developing countries are predicted to account for 74&nbsp;percent of
            incremental world energy demand to&nbsp;2030. Almost half of this
            increase is forecast to come from China and India alone. Both these
            countries have had spectacular economic growth in recent years (over
            10&nbsp;percent). This exceptional economic growth has contributed
            to some extreme energy demand predictions.

            Economic growth is the dominant driver for increased energy
            consumption as historically, world energy demand has essentially
            tracked both increasing income and GDP (Figure&nbsp;2). Due to
            efficiency improvements and fuel switching, energy intensity and
            emission intensity have improved.

          <h2 id="s5">Canadian Context for Supply and Demand Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Canadians, in the midst of energy riches, face a perplexing paradox
            of energy supply and demand. As an example, Canada is in the
            enviable position of having the highest ratio of oil
            reserves-to-production ratios in world: 200&nbsp;years versus a
            world average of 42&nbsp;years<sup>[6]</sup>. Despite relatively
            abundant resources, the development of Canada's resources is subject
            to the uncertainties of world commodity markets. Additionally,
            resource transportation is limited by infrastructure that does not
            always favour nationwide, or east-west, flow.

          <p>
            The historical trend (1990-2004) of energy demand in Canada could be
            characterized as one of robust growth with all sectors showing
            increasing demand. As illustrated in
            <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a>, total energy demand growth in
            this period was 23&nbsp;percent. Energy demand growth by sector is
            as follows: 10&nbsp;percent residential, 35&nbsp;percent commercial,
            30&nbsp;percent for industry, and 31&nbsp;percent for
            transportation. Although efficiency in all sectors has improved, the
            impact of a growing economy and population, as well as relatively
            inexpensive energy is clearly evident in the trend. According to NEB
            modeling, energy demand (Continuing Trends scenario) is expected to
            increase by 18 percent by&nbsp;2015 and 35&nbsp;percent by
            2030<sup>[7]</sup>.

            *&nbsp;Apart from the overriding macro-economic differences between
            scenarios, the difference in demand growth between the two scenarios
            can be divided roughly into thirds based on: a)&nbsp;extensive
            energy efficiency measures, b)&nbsp;impact (price response) due to
            application of carbon pricing, and c)&nbsp;impact of renewable
            energy (non-primary) and structural changes in economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB Reference Case demand analysis included over one hundred
            federal and provincial energy programs that were already in place in
            2004. The last few years have seen a major resurgence in
            government-initiated energy demand management programs addressing
            supply, price, and environmental concerns. Energy and environmental
            policy proposals have been released in all provinces and territories
            in the last two&nbsp;years. These regulations and proposals are
            analyzed as part of the NEB's ongoing monitoring of energy demand.
            For a number of reasons, including time-lag for policy
            implementation and existing stock turn-over rates, the near-term
            impact of these specific programs is minor. While global issues such
            as energy commodity prices and economic growth will likely be the
            dominant driver for energy demand change in Canada, this does not
            detract from the significance of these policies, particularly at a
            provincial level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most provincial programs related to energy demand are embedded
            within broader climate change strategies. Every province has
            released new or updated energy and environment strategies that would
            reduce emissions. These strategies incorporate a mix of energy
            efficiency, energy conservation, renewable energy (including
            renewable fuel), and, in three cases, carbon pricing. Many of the
            announced initiatives are still under development at this time.
            There are, however, several policy announcements that will be
            considered as part of future demand analysis. One of the most
            notable is the <em>B.C. Energy Plan</em> which includes an
            aggressive demand side management (DSM) program, which will offset
            50 percent of British Columbia's expected demand growth. The plan
            also includes requirements for zero-emissions electricity
            generation, renewable fuel standards, and a recently implemented
            carbon tax<sup>[8,9]</sup>.

            Ontario is also a leader in provincial energy policy related to
            demand management. A recent Ontario Power Authority proposal calls
            for demand management measures to reduce Ontario's electrical load
            by 6300 megawatt (MW) by 2025. Alberta has intensity based emission
            targets for industry starting in 2008. These programs will have an
            impact on provincial energy demand and national energy dynamics. A
            summary of the new provincial energy and environment strategies is
            attached as <a href="#nnx2">Appendix&nbsp;2</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most notable energy demand development at the federal level is
            based on Canada's Clean Air Regulatory Agenda included in the
            government report,
            <em
              >Turning the Corner: An Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gases and
              Air Pollution</em
            ><sup>[10]</sup>. A target of 20&nbsp;percent reduction in GHGs from
            2006 levels by&nbsp;2020 and 60 to 70&nbsp;percent from current
            levels by&nbsp;2050 is proposed. This would mean a
            330&nbsp;megatonne (Mt) reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020.
            Emissions reductions are not necessarily synonomous with energy
            demand reduction. Carbon capture and storage and increased renewable
            energy actually provide the majority of the emissions reduction,
            however, energy efficiency is still a major component. Environment
            Canada's analysis indicates that about one-third of the projected
            emissons reduction are directly allocated to secondary energy use
            efficiency improvements. Again, these emissions reduction-based
            programs indirectly provide the basis for updated energy demand
            analysis. With the number of federal and provincial announcements,
            the climate change agenda will have an unprecedented level of impact
            on demand.

          <p>
            The cornerstone of the federal climate change initiative is an
            intensity-based reduction, that is, GHG emissions per unit of output
            of 18&nbsp;percent from&nbsp;2006 levels by&nbsp;2010, and
            2&nbsp;percent per year thereafter. This applies to each of the
            16&nbsp;major industrial sectors or large final emitters (LFEs). New
            efficiency based regulations are forthcoming in the building and
            transportation sectors as well. Measures include new building
            standards, appliance standards, lighting regulations, and vehicle
            fuel economy ratings. Achievement of the 20&nbsp;percent reduction
            in emissions will rely heavily on changes in the transportation
            sector (through efficiency gains) and electric generation sector
            (through fuel switching and replacing existing generation with more
            efficient technology) (Figure&nbsp;3).

            Technological improvements are another fundamental driver of the

            generally very slight and the evolution of most technology
            &quot;breakthroughs&quot; is measured in decades. That being said,
            in the last few years, investment in &quot;green&quot; technology

            Most technological investment has been directed towards the solar,
            wind, and biofuels sectors. It is interesting to note that energy
            efficiency attracted only about one percent of investment funding
            in&nbsp;2006<sup>[15]</sup>. Overall, the level of investment is
            indicative of a hyperactive market and this supports many
            assumptions favouring clean technology breakthroughs. However, it is
            difficult to predict the winning technologies, their timing, and
            ultimate impact.

            As an indication of the opportunity for improved efficiency gains in
            an energy-centered economy, approximately half of the energy content
            of primary fuels is lost by the time it reaches the end-use device

            example, on-site power generation to allow waste heat recovery for
            heating or other uses. This evolving definition of end-use demand
            will make future energy demand analysis more complex.

            Major transformations in energy demand have happened in the past and
            no doubt will happen again. Further briefing notes in this series
            will examine in detail, by sector, the many technology opportunities
            that have the potential to redefine energy use in the world.

          <h2 id="s7">Attitudes Towards Energy</h2>
          <p>
            Changes in public attitudes and behaviours towards the use of energy
            has perhaps the most significant influence on energy demand, but
            behaviours are the most difficult to quantify for the purposes of
            analysis. For example, will Canadians use public transit more often?
            Will Canadians reduce their electricity consumption? Public opinion
            polls and consumer spending habits would suggest a fundamental shift
            in attitude towards energy has evolved in the last few years. This
            is, in part, a straightforward price response that could be expected
            given high energy prices. Historically, however, the market has
            indicated energy demand is relatively inelastic. Future demand
            modeling will incorporate consumer demand response to a high energy
            cost regime. Further to this, it will be important to account for a
            rising social conscience which embraces conservation values and acts
            on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Demand analysis takes into account consumer behavior as much as
            quantifiably possible. Whether it is from an environmental or energy
            price perspective, this viewpoint influences how decisions are made,
            how systems are designed, and how devices and services are used. A
            few years ago, hybrid cars, green buildings and smart meters were
            considered marginal market influences; as they now move into the
            mainstream, energy demand analysis evolves.

            Understanding Energy Demand: Exploring the Resource Potential
          </h2>
          <p>
            Understanding energy demand dynamics requires a thorough evaluation
            of historical demand trends, consideration of the hundreds of
            interacting elements of energy demand that can combine to produce
            major impacts, and making many assumptions on future trends.
            Appreciating the opportunity for energy demand to transition the
            economy, stabilize markets, enhance market efficiency, and offer a
            positive message for an energy future begins with a shared analysis
            of the opportunity. As the NEB faces larger and increasingly complex
            issues as part of its regulatory agenda, an expanded understanding
            of energy demand is fundamental to our purpose. With this in mind,
            our briefing note series will continue over the next year with
            topic-specific analysis. This work forms the foundation of data to
            be included in upcoming national energy supply and demand forecasts.
            The briefing notes will also serve as stand-alone information pieces
            that help fulfil the Board's mandate of informing Canadians about
            energy issues. Upcoming topics to be reviewed include:

            <li>Update on transportation technology and policy</li>
            <li>

          <p>
            The level of energy demand related activity in both government
            policy and technology investment is indicative of renewed
            priorities. If the continuation of a business-as-usual trend in
            energy consumption is unacceptable, a thorough and highly integrated
            analysis of energy supply and demand is necessary in order to
            understand future options. The many uncertainties in the energy
            market at present only serve to reinforce the need for continual
            monitoring and analysis on energy demand issues. A deeper
            understanding of issues and options works to counteract the recent
            volatility in energy markets, and assists in building the long-term
            stability needed for appropriate future investment in Canada.

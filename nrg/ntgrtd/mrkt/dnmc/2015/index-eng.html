            Dynamic changes in supply, demand, and infrastructure continually
            shape Canada’s energy sector. The National Energy Board (NEB or

            Canada experienced slower economic growth in 2015, with negative
            gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first half of the year
            and a modest rebound in the second half. Energy use growth is
            expected to slow in 2015 due to job losses and production
            curtailments in natural resource sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The crude oil price decline that started in 2014 intensified in
            2015, with the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching a
            six-year low of US$35 per barrel in December 2015. Despite the slide
            in crude oil prices, western Canadian oil production reached a
            record high of 3.85&nbsp;million barrels per day (MMb/d) in February
            2015. As a result of forest fires and facility shutdowns in Alberta,
            annual production growth slowed to 0.13&nbsp;MMb/d. Production
            growth in the United States (U.S.) also slowed in 2015, and
            expectations for future supply growth in the U.S. have decreased due
            to the low oil price environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decline in crude oil prices, combined with strong liquids-rich
            gas production in the U.S., contributed to lower natural gas liquids
            prices. With seasonal heating demand failing to materialize during
            the 2014/15 winter, underground propane inventories in western
            Canada and the U.S. rapidly increased, resulting in negative propane
            prices at the Edmonton hub in June.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gasoline prices in Canada and the U.S. climbed steadily over the
            summer months due to high gasoline demand and refinery outages. As
            refineries returned to operation and as demand waned at the end of
            the summer driving season, gasoline prices declined towards the end
            of 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shales in the U.S.
            continued to displace Canadian exports to the U.S. New pipeline
            projects have been proposed in Ontario to bring U.S. gas into
            eastern Canada and further displace western Canadian natural gas in
            that market.
          </p>
          <p>
            No Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects started
            construction in 2015. With LNG prices falling in conjunction with
            crude oil prices, and several new U.S. LNG projects either completed
            or under construction, Canadian LNG projects face an increasingly
            challenging business environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Low wholesale electricity prices continued in 2015 as annual average
            prices in Alberta and Ontario fell to the lowest levels since the
            two markets were deregulated. New supply and slowing demand growth
            were the driving factors in the decline in annual average prices.
            With respect to renewables, capacity additions continued in 2015,
            but at a slower rate. Soft electricity demand, lower prices, and
            changing incentives were factors behind the slowdown in capacity
            growth.

          <h3>
            Drivers of Energy Use Point to a Modest Increase in Consumption in
            2015
          </h3>
          <p>
            Canadian energy use depends on several factors including: weather,
            technology improvements, consumer preferences, and economic
            variables such as income, employment rates, industrial activity, and
            energy prices. Several competing factors put upward and downward
            pressures on energy use in 2015 as shown in Figure&nbsp;1.

                Description: This bar chart compares several drivers of energy
                use between 2014 and 2015. Factors that placed upward pressure
                on energy demand in 2015 include: lower retail gasoline and
                residential natural gas prices, and higher bitumen production.
                Factors that placed downward pressure on energy demand in 2015
                include: slower economic growth and fewer heating degree days.

            </div>
          </details>
          <div class="clearfix"></div>
          <p>
            Upward pressures on energy demand included lower natural gas prices
            (which encouraged greater consumption), a colder-than-average winter
            in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, and increased air conditioning demand
            due to a warm summer in most provinces.
          </p>
          <p>
            An increase in energy-intensive oil and gas production also put
            upward pressure on energy demand in 2015, with bitumen production
            increasing 12&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent over 2014 levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vehicle fuel efficiency continues to improve within individual
            categories. However, the trend of consumers preferring larger, more
            energy consuming vehicles such as trucks, sport utility vehicles,
            and minivans over lighter passenger cars continued in 2015. Total
            vehicle sales increased 2.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent year-to-date, with
            sales of heavier vehicles up nearly eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent and
            sales of lighter passenger cars down by five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slower economic growth was the main factor that reduced energy
            demand in 2015. Canada’s GDP declined in the first two quarters of
            2015 before resuming modest growth in the rest of the year. Although
            total employment increased, significant job losses occurred in
            several sectors, particularly natural resources. Temporary shutdowns
            at coal and potash mines due to low commodity prices further reduced
            energy use. Further downward pressure on energy demand resulted from
            the fact that in Ontario, and in much of western Canada, heating
            requirements in 2015 were lower than in 2014, which had a notably
            severe winter.
          </p>
          <h3>Energy Use Trends in 2015 Vary by Fuel Type and Region</h3>
          <p>
            Overall, natural gas demand stayed flat in 2015. Natural gas sales
            to the industrial sector grew by over three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from
            January to November compared to the same period in 2014, but this
            growth was offset by declining residential and commercial natural
            gas demand due to warmer weather in western Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refined petroleum product (RPP) demand in Canada is typically
            comprised of 40&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent gasoline and
            30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent diesel, with the remainder consisting of
            products such as jet fuel, asphalt, and kerosene. Total product
            demand was lower in 2015 than in 2014, despite lower prices. Much of
            this appears to be related to economic factors, particularly the
            effect of the oil price drop on Alberta’s economy and industrial
            production. Alberta’s January to October RPP sales dropped by
            14&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2015, although 2015 RPP sales in most other
            provinces are similar to 2014 sales as shown in Figure&nbsp;2.

            Total electricity use in Canada was largely flat. Increased
            electricity use related to space heating in Quebec and Atlantic

                Description: This chart shows the price of crude oil for major
                benchmarks over the period of 2011-2015. Since mid-2014, crude
                oil prices have dropped substantially as a result of oversupply
                in world markets. At the end of 2015, WTI traded at about US$35
                per barrel.

            The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) continued
            to produce at high levels, which combined with very high global
            crude oil inventories, provided the market with a substantial supply
            cushion. In non-OPEC countries, year-over-year supply growth fell by
            46&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, to 1.3&nbsp;million barrels per day (MMb/d)
            in 2015 from 2.4&nbsp;MMb/d in 2014. A reduction in U.S. drilling
            resulted in U.S. crude oil production growth slowing from
            1.2&nbsp;MMb/d in 2014 to 0.7&nbsp;MMb/d in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            U.S. crude production and inventory trends illustrate the market
            supply challenge in 2015. With continued strong growth in U.S. crude
            oil production in the beginning of 2015, commercial crude oil stocks
            reached an all-time high of 490&nbsp;million barrels in April.
            Higher U.S. gasoline demand and slowing crude oil production led to
            inventory declines during the summer. However, by the fourth
            quarter, U.S. inventories resumed accumulating, and ended 2015 at
            483&nbsp;million barrels, up 26&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from the end of
            2014.
          </p>
          <h3>Ongoing Uncertainty and Adjustment in Global Oil Markets</h3>
          <p>
            Analysts expect that it will take time to rebalance the global oil
            market. Low prices are expected to continue supporting global crude
            oil demand growth, which the International Energy Agency (IEA)
            estimates more than doubled to a five-year high of 1.8&nbsp;MMb/d in
            2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swift and dramatic reductions in capital investments have already
            occurred in non-OPEC countries, including Canada, where the Canadian
            Association of Petroleum Producers estimates that the upstream
            sector reduced spending by approximately 40&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in
            2015. The low price environment is expected to lead to further
            reductions in non-OPEC spending and supply in 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late December 2015, U.S. lawmakers lifted the ban on the export
            of crude oil which had been in place since 1975. However, given
            current U.S. crude oil prices relative to international prices, and
            expectations of lower near-term growth in U.S. light, tight oil
            production, it could be some time before significant export volumes
            are reached. Canadian producers, who currently rely on exports to
            the U.S., are likely to benefit over the long term as exports from
            the U.S. are expected to support U.S. crude oil price
            competitiveness based on international markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other key market uncertainties include: the level and timing of
            increased Iranian oil exports following the lifting of economic
            sanctions, evolving OPEC policy, the effects of an economic slowdown
            in China, and the prospects for U.S. light, tight oil production.
          </p>
          <h3>Canadian Exports Reach Record Level, but Revenues Drop</h3>
          <p>
            Despite record high export volumes, Canadian crude oil export
            revenue dropped substantially in 2015. (Figure&nbsp;4) Estimated
            revenue from oil exports in 2015 was $41.2&nbsp;billion, a decline
            of 42&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from 2014. This has had a significant
            effect on Canada’s economy and balance of trade. The Bank of Canada
            estimated that low oil prices reduced Canadian GDP by
            1.25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in the first half of 2015.

            Differentials Narrow on Upgrader Maintenance and Alberta Forest
            Fires
          </h3>
          <p>
            In June and July, the differential between WTI and WCS narrowed to
            approximately US$8 per barrel - the smallest differential since
            2009. This narrow differential was related to the temporary loss of
            more than 200 thousand barrels per day (Mb/d) of bitumen production
            because of upgrader maintenance and wildfire-related facility
            shutdowns in northern Alberta. Heavy oil production returned to
            normal in July. In mid-August, a two-week outage at the BP refinery
            in Indiana, and a four-day shutdown on Enbridge’s Flanagan South
            pipeline lowered demand for Canadian heavy crude oil, leading to the
            differential widening again in the autumn.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the fourth quarter of 2015, total heavy oil production grew
            steadily as oil sands projects resumed regular operations, and other
            projects ramped up production. Oil sands projects from Imperial Oil,
            ConocoPhillips, Husky Energy, Athabasca Oil, and Pengrowth had
            gains, with new phases commissioned in 2015. However, the low price
            environment has also resulted in numerous oil sands projects being
            cancelled or deferred in 2015. Most of these projects had not begun
            construction, with the notable exception of Shell’s Carmon Creek
            project, which was put on hold indefinitely in October.

          <h3>Canadian Crude by Rail Exports Decline in 2015</h3>
          <p>
            Exports of Canadian crude oil by rail averaged 132&nbsp;Mb/d in
            2015, down 18&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from 2014. There was a notable low
            in railed exports in the second quarter of 2015, when the WTI-WCS
            differential was narrow and approximated the cost of pipeline
            transportation, which is roughly half to two thirds of the cost of
            rail transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the transportation cost for rail from Alberta to the
            U.S. Gulf Coast is around US$15 to US$22 per barrel, versus
            approximately US$7 to US$13 per barrel for pipeline. Shipping crude
            oil by rail tends to increase as the differential widens because
            higher prices in markets such as the Gulf Coast offset the higher
            cost of rail. As the differential widened in the late summer,
            volumes of crude oil exported by rail from western Canada picked up
            again. (Figure&nbsp;6)

            Total Canadian crude oil movement by rail, both exports and
            domestic, is estimated to be 173&nbsp;Mb/d for 2015, a
            12&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent decrease from 2014. This decrease is largely
            due to low oil prices squeezing rail’s economic viability.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014, roughly half of all Canadian crude by rail exports were
            delivered to the U.S. East Coast and one-third were delivered to the
            U.S. Gulf Coast. In 2015, the share of exports delivered to the Gulf
            Coast increased to one-half, while the share to the East Coast
            declined to one-third.

                which runs from Sarnia, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec. While the
                pipeline previously delivered crude oil from Montreal to
                refineries in Sarnia, the pipeline was reversed in November 2013
                to deliver oil from Sarnia to refineries in North Westover,
                which is just northwest of Hamilton, Ontario. In December, 2015,
                the remaining portion of the pipeline was reversed so that oil
                can flow from Sarnia all the way to Montreal.

            The Energy East Pipeline Project application was filed with the NEB
            in October 2014. Energy East is a 4 600&nbsp;km pipeline proposed to
            carry 1.1&nbsp;MMb/d of western Canadian crude oil to refineries and
            export facilities in eastern Canada. In April 2015, TransCanada
            announced that it was making a route adjustment to remove a port in
            Quebec from the project’s scope and in December 2015, TransCanada
            filed amendments to the Energy East application. The amendments
            included 700 route adjustments. Energy East is targeting an
            in-service date of 2020 if it receives the necessary regulatory
            approvals and permits.

          <h3>Crude Oil Price Decline Pulls Down Liquids Prices</h3>
          <p>
            In 2015, natural gas liquids (NGL) prices were at their lowest
            levels in a decade, driven primarily by the fall in crude oil
            prices. The annual average price of WTI declined by
            48&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent between 2014 and 2015, while the annual
            average prices for propane, butane, and condensate at the Edmonton
            NGL price hub declined by 87, 54, and 46&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent,
            respectively. (Figure&nbsp;9)

            The propane market has experienced significant turbulence in recent
            years, from the crop drying and Polar Vortex-driven demand shock of
            2013/14 to swelling U.S. supply and storage overhangs in 2015. In
            fact, the
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/snpsht/2015/05-03prpnnvntr-eng.html"
              >storage surplus in Edmonton</a
            >
            was so large following the 2014/15 winter that underground
            inventories in March were three times the five-year average and over
            seven times the volume reported in March 2014. This surplus,
            combined with a bottleneck in moving propane out of Edmonton,
            resulted in propane prices trading at or below zero in June.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the drop in NGL prices, some gas processing plants in
            Alberta chose not to extract liquids from the natural gas. Instead,
            the liquids remained in the gas stream and are sold as heat to users
            of natural gas.
          </p>
          <h3>Propane Exports Increase in 2015, but Export Value Plummets</h3>
          <p>
            Low western Canadian prices incented producers to increase propane
            export volumes in 2015. Despite this increase, the value of exports
            reached a ten-year low in 2015 due to low prices and western
            Canadian propane selling at a discount in order remain competitive
            in the well-supplied U.S. market.
          </p>
          <p>
            The increase in exports was facilitated by rail movements, as
            pipeline exports declined following conversion of the Cochin
            Pipeline from a propane export line to a condensate import line in
            April 2014. Rail now transports three-quarters of Canadian propane
            exports, and this share could continue to increase in 2016 following
            completion of Keyera’s 40&nbsp;Mb/d Josephburg Rail Terminal near
            Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta in July 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            The export volumes in Figure&nbsp;10 only account for specification
            propane, and do not include the NGLs moved in the natural gas stream
            on the Alliance Pipeline. The Alliance Pipeline, which delivers
            liquids-rich natural gas from western Canada directly to the Aux
            Sable gas plant in Illinois, saw its volume of entrained liquids

              >increase in 2015</a
            >
            due to low NGL prices in western Canada relative to NGL prices in
            the U.S. Midwest.

                The stacked bar chart showcases the declining role that

                Meanwhile, rail now accounts for over 75 per cent of export
                volumes. The stacked bars also show that total propane exports
                grew 17&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent to 105&nbsp;Mb/d in 2015. However,
                the value of propane exports is predicted to decline
                48&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, from $1.7&nbsp;billion in 2014 to

            refinery margins, and retail margins are also factors. However,
            crude oil is generally the most volatile component, and the price of
            gasoline tends to track the price of crude oil closely.

            January to October 2015 was 3.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent above the

                U.S gasoline demand in 2015 was above the five-year range for

            This high demand, combined with supply reducing refinery outages in
            Canada, and the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast regions, were the
            primary factors behind gasoline prices in the U.S. and Canada
            trending upwards over the summer. Although the U.S. gasoline market
            is ten times the size of the Canadian market, the two markets are
            highly integrated and tend to follow similar price trends. Gasoline
            also typically trades at a stable differential between Canada and
            the U.S. as illustrated in Figure&nbsp;11, with the difference
            primarily reflecting higher taxes in Canada.

          <h3>Gasoline Prices Declined in Second Half of the Year</h3>
          <p>
            By the end of the summer, lower crude oil prices, lower seasonal
            demand, growing U.S. gasoline inventories, and the completion of
            maintenance at refineries resulted in gasoline prices in both Canada
            and the U.S. declining. By December, Canadian gasoline prices
            declined to 102.3&nbsp;cents per litre, a 17&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent

            Northeast is increasingly serving markets that were previously
            served from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB).
            (Figure&nbsp;13) The Marcellus, which produced just under 2.0
            billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2009&nbsp; has grown to
            average 16&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2015. To put the size and growth of the
            Marcellus in context, this region added “a Canada’s worth” of

            To enable delivery of U.S.-produced natural gas into eastern Canada
            and to meet growing demand in that market, new pipeline
            infrastructure is being built and existing infrastructure is being
            expanded. For example, Niagara, historically an export point, was
            reversed in late 2012 to enable the import of approximately
            400&nbsp;billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in MMcf/d from the U.S.
            into eastern Ontario. In the last quarter of 2015, capacity at
            Niagara was further expanded and the point saw imports increase to

            This storage accumulation, as shown in Figure&nbsp;14, is
            particularly remarkable considering that storage levels following
            the 2014 Polar Vortex fell below 1.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf).
            However, by mid-September 2015, the U.S. had surpassed its previous
            storage record of 3.9&nbsp;Tcf. Canadian storage levels remained
            close to the five-year average throughout the injection season and
            peaked at 0.7&nbsp;Tcf in mid-November, resulting in record combined
            Canadian and U.S. storage of 4.7&nbsp;Tcf.

            The Montney supply area in northeastern B.C. continued to grow in
            2015. In the NEB’s latest

              >Canadian natural gas deliverability report</a
            >, Montney production was expected to reach 3.6&nbsp;Bcf/d by late
            2015. The Montney now accounts for 25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total
            WCSB production, up from six&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2010 when
            production was 0.9&nbsp;Bcf/d.
          </p>
          <p>
            As supply from northeast B.C. increased, pipelines became fully
            contracted at some points. Several other developments also added to
            system constraints in the region: the Nova Gas Transmission Ltd.
            (NGTL) system was subject to pressure restrictions; Westcoast and
            NGTL both experienced maintenance outages that were sometimes
            simultaneous; and the Alliance Pipeline was shut down for six days
            in August.
          </p>
          <p>
            Increasing supply and constrained access to markets resulted in
            natural gas trading at average monthly prices of approximately $1.12
            per GJ at Westcoast Station&nbsp;2 (located near Chetwynd, B.C.)
            during the last quarter of 2015. During several days in the second
            half of 2015, the spot price fell below $0.50 per GJ. By comparison,
            intra-Alberta natural gas was trading at an average monthly price of
            $2.35 per GJ in the last quarter of 2015.

            Despite supply growth from northeastern B.C. in 2015, gas-directed
            drilling activity in the WCSB as a whole declined in 2015 as shown

          <h3>Global LNG Supply Growth Jumps in 2015 but Global Demand Flat</h3>
          <p>
            In 2015, global LNG supply increased by approximately
            three&nbsp;Bcf/d, or eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. Projects under
            construction, mostly in Australia and the U.S., will add another
            13&nbsp;Bcf/d of liquefaction capacity by 2019 as illustrated in
            Figure&nbsp;17. In the U.S., exports at the Sabine Pass terminal in
            Louisiana are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2016.
            Four other liquefaction projects are currently under construction in
            the U.S., totaling 8.0&nbsp;Bcf/d of export capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            While liquefaction capacity expanded, demand growth moderated to
            approximately one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2015. Warmer 2014/15 winter
            temperatures and the addition of nuclear capacity from new builds
            and restarts reduced the need for LNG imports in Japan and South
            Korea. Combined, these two countries account for roughly half of the
            global LNG market.

                Description: This graph illustrates LNG and natural gas
                benchmark prices. While natural gas prices remained relatively
                stable, LNG import prices in the Asian and northwest European

            The low price environment made it easier for buyers to find
            competitively priced supplies and more difficult for potential LNG
            suppliers to secure long-term contracts. Furthermore, the decline in
            crude oil prices affected the earnings of oil and gas companies,
            which are typically involved in the development of LNG terminals. If
            the low price environment persists, these companies may now be less
            inclined to invest in costly terminal projects.

          <h3>No Canadian Liquefaction Terminals Under Construction</h3>
          <p>
            By the end of 2015, the NEB approved export licences for 22&nbsp;LNG
            projects totaling more than 50&nbsp;Bcf/d of export capacity.
            However, despite these numerous proposals, no LNG export terminals
            have started construction in Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            While most Canadian projects are proposed for the West Coast,
            seven&nbsp;licenses, for exports totaling approximately
            eight&nbsp;Bcf/d, have been granted for projects proposed in Nova
            Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to export licences, LNG project proponents must obtain
            various permits for the construction of liquefaction facilities and
            related pipelines. Depending on the specifics of the project, this
            could include permits from federal and provincial environment
            assessment organizations, federal and provincial energy regulators,
            and several other authorizations. As of December 2015, no Canadian
            projects have obtained all of the required permits.
          </p>
          <p>
            In June 2015, Pacific NorthWest LNG made a conditional final
            investment decision and is waiting for an environmental assessment
            certificate from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to
            confirm its final investment decision. No other Canadian LNG project
            has reached the final investment decision stage.

            Alberta
          </h3>
          <p>
            Natural gas-fired capacity grew in Alberta, driven by low natural
            gas prices and expectations for long-term demand growth. In March
            2015, commercial operations began at the 800&nbsp;MW Enmax Shepard
            Energy Centre, Alberta’s largest gas-fired plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the low oil price environment could affect future additions
            in Alberta, since most of Alberta’s electricity demand comes from
            the industrial sector, including the oil sands. In 2015, Alberta’s
            electricity demand growth slowed to less than one percent from three
            percent in 2014.

            Wholesale Electricity Prices at or Close to Record Lows in
            Deregulated Markets
          </h3>
          <p>
            From 2014, annual average wholesale electricity prices in Alberta
            and Ontario decreased by approximately 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. In
            Ontario, prices fell to levels similar to historical lows reached in
            2012, after having increased in 2014 due to severe winter
            conditions. As a result of sizeable capacity additions and slower
            electricity demand growth, prices in Alberta reached the lowest
            levels since market deregulation in 2000.

          <p>
            Canada is a net exporter of electricity, led by provinces with
            significant hydroelectric capacity. In 2015, net exports reached a
            record 55 terawatt hours (TW.h), as shown in Figure&nbsp;19.
            Capacity additions and lower than expected domestic electricity
            demand contributed to this milestone.

            Several new international power lines (IPL) between Canada and the
            U.S. were proposed to take advantage of the electricity capacity
            surplus in some provinces. In August 2015, the NEB received its
            first application for a new IPL since 2005. The ITC Lake Erie
            Connector is a proposed 117&nbsp;km, 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;MW
            interconnection that would run under Lake Erie between Nanticoke,
            Ontario and Erie, Pennsylvania. If approved and constructed, the
            project would provide the first direct interconnection between the
            Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland electricity market and the Ontario
            market. Public sources indicate that IPLs may also be proposed in
            Quebec and Manitoba. (Figure&nbsp;20)

            Canadian Renewable Capacity Growth Strong, but Slowing in 2015
          </h3>
          <p>
            Non-hydro renewable capacity continues to grow, but annual additions
            slowed considerably in 2015. Solar capacity stood at 1 695&nbsp;MW,
            up 11&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from 2014. By comparison, total solar
            capacity grew 48&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2014. Similarly, wind
            capacity additions grew by only eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2015
            compared to 23&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2014. Notably, Alberta - the
            province with the third highest installed wind capacity - did not
            add any new wind capacity in 2015.

                capacity additions by year and province or region. In 2015,
                Canada’s total installed wind capacity surpassed the
                10&nbsp;000&nbsp;MW mark. Over 80&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of
                installed wind capacity is concentrated in three provinces

          <p>
            This slowdown in capacity additions can be attributed to slower
            demand growth, lower prices, and changing incentives. In 2015,
            electricity demand in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec was either lower
            or flat compared to 2014. In addition, average 2015 electricity pool
            prices in Alberta were below the five-year and ten-year averages.
            Furthermore, the 2016 contract schedule for Ontario’s solar
            feed-in-tariff program shows a 24&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent drop from 2015
            contract prices.

            While renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and
            geothermal continue to gain ground in Canada, non-hydro renewables
            still comprise a small percentage of Canada’s total electricity
            portfolio. In 2014, the latest year for which data is available,
            non-hydro renewable generating capacity accounted for
            9.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total generating capacity. Hydro capacity
            accounted for 55.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent and thermal capacity (coal,
            nuclear, natural gas, diesel, and oil) accounted for the remainder
            (Figure&nbsp;22). However, since wind and solar are intermittent
            resources, total generation from non-hydro renewables accounted for
            4.4&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, while hydroelectricity accounts for more
            than 60&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. Given the time it takes for generation
            capacity to change significantly, the information displayed in
            Figure&nbsp;22 will likely not change significantly once 2015 data
            is made available.

            Global Renewable Developments and Technologies Continue Advancing
          </h3>
          <p>
            Penetration by renewable generation has gained significant global
            momentum in recent years. According to a report by Clean Energy
            Canada, by the beginning of 2015, global renewable investments had
            reached US$260&nbsp;billion. Of that amount, 58&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            was for wind, 38&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for solar, and
            four&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for geothermal, biomass, and
            waste-to-energy. Global wind and solar installed capacity was
            estimated at approximately 550 gigawatts (GW), with Canada ranking
            sixth in global wind deployments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the cost of generation from renewables remains higher than
            more traditional sources, technological advancements have led to
            reduced costs and greater competitiveness, even as incentives and
            subsidies decrease. For example, even taking into account newer
            units that are capable of more generation per unit, the relative
            cost of solar photovoltaic cells continued to drop in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Storage technologies also improved, and lithium-ion battery costs
            fell due to economies of scale. Battery technology is particularly
            significant because it could help provide a more efficient platform
            for balancing demand with generation from intermittent resources, as
            well as provide increased stability when integrating renewables into
            electricity systems.

            The influence of climate policies and programs on Canadian energy
            markets is increasing. In 2013, more than 80&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of
            Canada’s GHG emissions in 2013 were attributed to the consumption of
            fossil fuels. Of Canada’s 726&nbsp;megatonnes (MT) of GHG emissions,
            one-quarter was produced by the oil and natural gas sector. Roughly
            another quarter of emissions were from the transportation sector,
            with other industries, electricity generation, residential and
            commercial buildings, agriculture, and waste comprising the
            remaining half of Canada’s GHG emissions. Figure&nbsp;23 shows total
            Canadian GHG emissions from 1990 to 2013, while Figure&nbsp;24

            Alberta Climate Panel Recommends Economy-Wide Carbon Pricing,
            Additional Policies
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Alberta government convened an advisory panel in the spring of
            2015 to review the province’s climate policies, consult with
            Albertans, and provide advice on a new set of climate policies. In
            November, the panel released a broad suite of policy recommendations
            and the Alberta government announced a climate leadership plan based
            on the recommendations put forward by the panel. The climate
            leadership plan includes a carbon price that will be applied across
            all sectors. This economy-wide carbon price will replace Alberta’s
            existing carbon pricing mechanism, which has been in place since
            2007 and applies only to large industrial facilities. The plan also
            extends carbon pricing to end-use GHG emissions resulting from the
            combustion of transportation and heating fuels. The climate
            leadership plan states that the price will start at $20 per tonne of
            GHG emissions in 2017 and increase to $30 per tonne in 2018. The $30
            per tonne price translates into seven&nbsp;cents per litre of
            gasoline and $1.68 per GJ for natural gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The climate leadership plan also states that the Alberta government
            is moving forward on the following policies: phasing out coal-fired
            generation by 2030, capping oil sands emissions, and a methane
            reduction plan for the oil and gas sector; however, details of the
            final strategy by the Alberta government are still being developed.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Carbon Pricing Well Established in Some Provinces, More Joining In
          </h3>
          <p>
            Broad-based carbon pricing is already in effect in B.C., which has
            had a carbon tax since 2008, and in Quebec, which implemented a
            cap-and-trade system in 2013 that is now linked to California’s
            carbon market. The carbon tax in B.C. is currently set at $30 per
            tonne while the settlement price of emission permits in Quebec
            averaged $15.85 per tonne in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ontario and Manitoba both announced plans to introduce cap-and-trade
            systems in 2015 that would be linked to the Quebec and California
            system. If climate pricing is implemented as proposed in Alberta,
            Ontario, and Manitoba over the coming years, five&nbsp;provinces
            representing 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of Canada’s population will have
            instituted broad-based carbon pricing. Manitoba currently has a $10
            per tonne price for emissions from coal.

            Additionally, in specified areas, the Board has regulatory
            responsibilities for oil and gas exploration and production
            activities under the <em>National Energy Board Act</em>,
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA), the Canada
            Petroleum Resources Act (CPRA), and the North West Territories’ Oil
            and Gas Operations Act (OGOA) and
            <em>Petroleum Resources Act</em> (PRA). For oil and natural gas
            exports, the Board’s role is to evaluate whether the oil and natural
            gas proposed to be exported is surplus to reasonably foreseeable
            Canadian requirements, having regard to trends in the discovery of
            oil or gas in Canada. The Board monitors energy markets, and
            assesses Canadian energy requirements and trends to support these
            responsibilities under Part&nbsp;VI of the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em>. This report,
            <em>Canadian Energy Dynamics: Highlights of 2015</em>, examines how
            elements of Canadian energy markets changed in 2015. It is one of a
            series of publications on energy supply, demand, and infrastructure
            that the NEB publishes regularly as part of its ongoing market
            monitoring.

                  Wide regional differences exist for the price of gasoline in
                  Canada, as crude oil refining costs, marketing costs, and
                  different tax regimes across the provinces all affect the
                  price at the pump. The gasoline prices reported in this
                  publication are the Canadian average price. For further
                  details and local prices please refer to

                  by the NEB has shown that Canadian gasoline prices track the
                  price of the global benchmark Brent more closely than the
                  price of WTI, though WTI is widely known as the North American
                  benchmark price for crude oil.

                  Natural gas is injected into underground storage caverns when
                  gas demand is low. Injections usually start in April, and
                  withdrawal from storage typically begins in November to meet
                  increased winter heating demand.

          <h2><a id="xctvsmmr"></a>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Energy is essential to our daily lives. The Canadian pipeline
            transportation system delivers energy in the form of natural gas,
            natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, and petroleum products.
            In&nbsp;2008, approximately $127&nbsp;billion worth of products
            moved through NEB-regulated pipelines to markets at home and in the
            United States (U.S.). The efficient and effective functioning of
            this system is critical to Canada's economic well-being. Canadians
            depend on this infrastructure for a safe, reliable, and efficient
            energy supply as well as energy trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pipelines regulated by the NEB are a key element in Canada's
            pipeline transportation system. The purpose of this report is to
            determine how well these elements are working to ensure that the
            Board's goal &quot;Canadians benefit from efficient energy
            infrastructure and markets&quot; is being achieved. Although the
            majority of information presented is an update and assessment
            for&nbsp;2008, where available, 2009 information is also provided.
          </p>
          <p>In this report, the Board assesses the following factors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>adequacy of pipeline capacity;</li>
            <li>pipeline tolls and shipper satisfaction; and</li>
            <li>the financial soundness of pipeline companies.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The specific conclusions are, as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Capacity remained tight on oil pipelines in&nbsp;2008, but
                additional capacity nearing completion is expected to alleviate
                current constraints.</strong
              >
              While there was some spare capacity on some oil pipeline systems
              in&nbsp;2008, there were periods of apportionment as incremental
              capacity additions were largely offset by increasing oil sands
              supply. A number of pipeline applications were filed and approved
              by the Board in&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008; that infrastructure is
              now being built and additional capacity is expected as early as
              the fourth&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;2009.<br />
              <br />
              <strong
                >There was adequate capacity in place on natural gas pipelines
                in&nbsp;2008.</strong
              >
              Most NEB-regulated gas pipelines had excess capacity, even during
              the peak winter season. Pipeline utilization declined for most
              pipelines supplying gas from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin
              (WCSB) in&nbsp;2008. Declining production from the WCSB, growing
              demand within western Canada, and competition from other supply
              basins, particularly in the western U.S., resulted in reduced
              flows on pipelines transporting gas from western Canada. Changing
              supply and demand dynamics may have important implications for
              both new and existing pipeline systems, including possibly
              challenging transitions with respect to utilization and tolls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >In&nbsp;2008, shippers continued to indicate that they were
                reasonably satisfied with the services provided by
                pipelines.</strong
              >
              The results of the NEB <em>Pipeline Services Survey</em> again
              rated the physical reliability of pipeline operations highly,
              while the degree to which pipeline companies demonstrate an
              attitude of continuous improvement and innovation received a lower
              score, indicating one area where shipper services could be
              improved.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >In&nbsp;2008, NEB-regulated pipelines companies were
                financially sound.</strong
              >
              Credit ratings continued to be investment grade and key financial
              ratios remained stable.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Based on this review of&nbsp;2008, the Board believes that, overall,
            the Canadian pipeline transportation system continues to work
            effectively.

          <h2 id="s1">1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The pipeline transportation system delivers natural gas, NGLs, crude
            oil, and petroleum products which are critical to Canada's
            well-being and economic activity. In&nbsp;2008, approximately
            $127&nbsp;billion worth of products were moved through NEB-regulated
            pipelines to markets at home, the United States (U.S.) and offshore.
            The cost of providing these transportation services last year is
            estimated to be around $4.4&nbsp;billion, not including the fuel
            costs paid by shippers on natural gas pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB regulates approximately 70&nbsp;000&nbsp;kilometres (km) of
            oil and natural gas pipelines,<sup>[2]</sup> which are key elements
            in Canada's hydrocarbon transportation system (Figures&nbsp;1.1
            and&nbsp;1.2). In addition to oil and natural gas pipelines, the
            system includes NGLs and oil products pipelines.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [2] This includes pipelines from the NOVA Gas Transmission System
            Ltd (NGTL) System. Th NEB assumed jurisdiction of the NGTL System on
            29&nbsp;April&nbsp;2009; for more information see Section&nbsp;2.4.

            In line with its mandate to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and efficient energy infrastructure and
            markets in the Canadian public interest<sup>[*]</sup>, the Board has
            identified five goals that articulate its purpose and core
            objectives:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              NEB-regulated facilities are safe and secure, and are perceived to
              be so.
            </li>
            <li>
              NEB-regulated facilities are built and operated in a manner that
              protects the environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Canadians benefit from efficient energy infrastructure and
              markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rights and interests of those affected by NEB-regulated
              facilities and activities are respected.
            </li>
            <li>
              The NEB delivers quality outcomes through innovation and
              leadership.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To determine whether these goals are being achieved, the Board has
            established various measures and a system of monitoring for each
            goal. Each year, the Board also issues various reports that discuss
            these different aspects of Canadian energy infrastructure and
            activities. This report focuses largely on aspects of Goal&nbsp;3,
            and provides an update on the Board's assessment of how well the
            Canadian pipeline system is working. This report marks the fifth
            consecutive year for this assessment and utilizes the system of
            monitoring and measurements for the performance of the
            transportation system that was established in previous years.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the pipeline transportation system to function efficiently and
            effectively, it must operate in a safe and environmentally
            acceptable manner, which relates to Goals&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2. The
            Board reports annually on the performance of NEB-regulated pipelines
            in these areas in a companion report entitled,
            <em
              >Focus on Safety and Environment - A Comparative Analysis of
              Pipeline Performance 2000-2007</em

            In this report, the following factors are assessed to determine how
            well NEB-regulated pipelines are working to ensure that the Board's
            goal &quot;Canadians benefit from efficient energy infrastructure
            and markets&quot; is being achieved:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>adequacy of pipeline capacity;</li>
            <li>pipeline tolls and shipper satisfaction; and</li>
            <li>the financial soundness of pipeline companies.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In general, an efficient pipeline transportation system will have an
            ability to respond on a timely basis to changing market conditions.
            This may entail adjustments to pipeline capacity or enhancement of
            pipeline services.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its assessment, the Board uses publicly available data for
            Group&nbsp;1 regulated companies and Express Pipeline Ltd.
            (Express), the largest Group&nbsp;2 company.<sup>[4]</sup> These
            companies represent the major NEB-regulated pipelines and provide a
            good view of the overall functioning of the pipeline transportation
            system. In addition, the Board uses throughput and capacity
            information received from the pipelines and input from the users of
            NEB-regulated pipelines. Although the majority of information
            presented in this report is an update and assessment for&nbsp;2008,
            where available, 2009 information is also provided. A listing of the
            pipeline companies regulated by the NEB, as of
            December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2008, can be found in Appendix&nbsp;1.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [4] For the purpose of the Board's financial regulation, pipeline
            companies are divided into two groups, Group&nbsp;1 and
            Group&nbsp;2. Historically, major oil and gas pipeline companies
            were designated as Group&nbsp;1 and generally under full regulation
            the NEB, while all other NEB-regulated pipelines were designated as
            Group&nbsp;2 and subject to a lighter degree of regulation. However,
            since Express, some major pipelines have been designated
            Group&nbsp;2.

          <h2 id="s2">2. Adequacy of Pipeline Capacity</h2>
          <p>
            A key measure of an energy market's operational efficiency is the
            ability of its pipeline system to adequately transport crude oil,
            refined products, natural gas and NGLs from producing to consuming
            regions as required.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter will examine the following factors to assess the
            current adequacy of pipeline capacity:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              price differentials compared with firm service tolls for major
              transportation paths;
            </li>
            <li>capacity utilization on pipelines; and</li>
            <li>the degree of apportionment on major oil pipelines.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The Board has generally taken the view that some excess capacity on
            a pipeline is desirable. This may result in higher tolls for
            shippers; however, the costs associated with inadequate pipeline
            capacity can be far greater. Substantial revenue loss for producers
            and governments can result when producers are unable to move oil and
            gas to market. In addition, excess capacity allows shippers the
            flexibility to access the appropriate markets as market conditions
            change, thereby maximizing their revenues.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_1">2.1 Price Differentials and Firm Service Tolls</h3>
          <p>
            When there is adequate pipeline capacity between two market hubs,
            commodity prices will be connected and the price differential will
            be equal to, or less than, the transportation costs between the two
            points. As long as the price differential is less than the toll
            (plus fuel for natural gas pipelines), the market is indicating that
            there is adequate pipeline capacity between the two pricing points.
            In a market with adequate capacity, suppliers will generally direct
            their product to the market that nets the highest revenue back to
            the seller, thereby meeting that region's need for energy. Where
            inadequate capacity exists, the product cannot get to market,
            resulting in higher prices for downstream consumers or lower
            revenues to producers, creating a higher differential in price
            between the two end points.

            <strong><em>Light-heavy Price Differentials</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The price differentials between Canadian light and heavy crude oil
            are determined by a number of factors including availability of
            pipeline capacity, supply and demand fundamentals at each end of the
            pipeline, seasonality and the grade (quality) of crude oil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically, the discussion of oil price differentials has
            typically revolved around heavy crude oil; however, with increased
            production of upgraded bitumen, the relative price differentials
            between synthetic crude oil, Canadian light crude oil, and other
            crude oil supplied to U.S. refineries is becoming an increasingly
            important issue. Largely because of increased synthetic crude oil
            production and limited pipeline capacity to downstream markets,
            price discounts have been observed on Canadian synthetic and light
            crude oil. During periods of constrained supply because of planned
            and unplanned maintenance at upgraders, however, synthetic crude oil
            has at times traded at a premium to West Texas Intermediate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure&nbsp;2.3 shows the light-heavy differential as indicated by
            the difference or gap in the average price paid for Edmonton Par
            light crude oil and the posted price of WCS at Hardisty. As
            illustrated, the differential is volatile and at times has been
            wide.

          <p>
            Historically, the average price differential between light and heavy
            crude oil benchmarks in markets where western Canadian oil competes
            has been around 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. In&nbsp;2008, the
            differential began the year at about this level; however, as crude
            oil prices climbed through the year it narrowed considerably to
            about 12&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in August. At the close of&nbsp;2008,
            the differential widened again to about 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            following the steep drop in both light and heavy crude oil prices.
            In January&nbsp;2009, on a dollar basis, the differential narrowed
            to its lowest level since February&nbsp;2002 largely due to reduced
            OPEC supplies of heavy and sour crude oil. Figure&nbsp;2.4 shows the
            light-heavy differential over the past several years, both on a
            dollar and percentage basis.

          />
          <p>
            In the past, a lack of take-away pipeline capacity and limited
            access to refineries that can process Canadian heavy crude oil
            contributed to the widening of the differential. Industry, however,
            has been making progress in developing new markets and supporting
            pipelines to connect these markets. Access to the Cushing Hub
            through the reversed Spearhead pipeline in September&nbsp;2006 and
            access to the U.S. Gulf Coast through the reversal of the Mobil
            pipeline in March&nbsp;2007 are prime examples. Major pipeline
            projects under construction, and proposed pipelines, aim to further
            expand market access for both Canadian light and heavy crude oil.

          <p>
            In order to use price differentials as an indicator of the adequacy
            of natural gas pipeline capacity, there must be reasonably reliable
            pricing data available. Two examples of price differentials compared
            with firm service tolls are provided below - one for transportation
            on TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TransCanada or TCPL) Mainline and
            one for transportation on Westcoast Energy Inc. (Westcoast), now
            operating as Spectra Energy Transmission.

            Figure&nbsp;2.5 shows the price differential from January&nbsp;2004
            to March&nbsp;2009 between Alberta and the Dawn, Ontario delivery
            point compared with the TransCanada firm service toll between the
            two points, including fuel costs. While the price differential
            between Alberta and the Dawn delivery point fluctuates during this
            period, it is generally below the total cost of transportation (firm
            transportation plus fuel) via the TransCanada pipeline connecting
            these two markets. This indicates that pipeline capacity is adequate
            between these locations.

          <p>
            As indicated by the variation in the price difference between the
            two locations, natural gas pricing is very responsive to relatively
            small changes in flow or demand. Exceptional natural gas demand in
            eastern markets has resulted in short-term increases in the price
            differential. Examples include the summer heat wave in&nbsp;2005
            which produced a strong demand for natural gas-fired power
            generation for air conditioning, and reduced supplies from the Gulf
            of Mexico in the months following hurricanes Katrina and Rita
            (August&nbsp;2005 to January&nbsp;2006). Conversely, mild weather
            and ample gas in storage can cause the price differential and the
            demand for gas and transportation services to moderate, such as
            occurred September&nbsp;2007. In the first half of&nbsp;2008,
            natural gas prices followed the rising trend in oil prices, reaching
            an all-time mid-summer high before themmodity price collapse and
            falling Canadian dollar (relative to the U.S. dollar) resulted in an
            erratic decline of the price differential between Alberta and Dawn.

            the firm service toll for transportation between the two locations,
            including fuel costs. Since January&nbsp;2004, except for the peak
            winter months in recent years, the price differential has been lower
            than, or close to, the cost of transportation, indicating that there
            has been adequate capacity in place.

          <p>
            Figure&nbsp;2.6 also demonstrates that natural gas pricing is
            volatile. Short-term increases in the price differential observed in
            recent years are generally a result of changes in market conditions
            such as hurricane-induced supply disruptions in the U.S.,
            unpredictable weather-related demand, and availability of other
            transportation options during such periods. Similar to the
            Alberta-Dawn price movements in&nbsp;2008, the Sumas-Station&nbsp;2
            price differential was affected by a rapid increase and subsequent
            decline in natural gas prices. In addition, the rapid movement in
            the Canada-U.S. exchange rate during October&nbsp;2008 impacted the
            price differential.

          <h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Capacity Utilization on Major Routes</h3>
          <p>
            Where adequate pricing data is not available at major receipt and
            delivery locations on pipeline systems, another measure of adequate
            capacity comes from directly comparing the throughput or flow on a
            pipeline with its capacity. The Board monitors capacity utilization
            for most of the large pipelines it regulates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following figures show pipeline average monthly throughput
            compared with capacity for some of the largest NEB-regulated

          <p>
            Determining the capacity on an oil pipeline can be complex as there
            are many factors to be considered including the type of product,
            product mix, type of batching and pipeline configurations. For
            example when heavy crude oil is transported on a pipeline, the
            capacity of the pipeline is reduced. Alternatively, when lighter
            crude oil or refined products are transported a pipeline has more
            capacity.

          <p>
            The Enbridge pipeline system originates at Edmonton, Alberta and
            extends east across the Canadian prairies to the U.S. border near
            Gretna, Manitoba where it joins with the Lakehead system in the U.S.
            It is the largest crude oil pipeline in the world and the primary
            transporter of crude oil from western Canada to markets in eastern
            Canada and the U.S. Midwest. The Enbridge/Lakehead system also
            connects with pipelines that deliver crude oil to Cushing, Oklahoma
            and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The system consists of many lines
            transporting crude oil, NGLs and refined petroleum products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure&nbsp;2.7 illustrates total monthly throughput versus capacity
            on the Enbridge system out of western Canada. Since the
            third&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;2006, however, many of its lines have
            been operating at or near full capacity with some lines experiencing
            apportionment (see Section&nbsp;2.3). In&nbsp;2008, Enbridge
            transported roughly 260&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (1.6&nbsp;MMb/d) of
            crude oil, petroleum products and NGLs. In the first&nbsp;quarter
            of&nbsp;2009, Enbridge operated at about 80&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of
            capacity.

            pipeline has been operating at or near capacity for several years
            and on many occasions has been under apportionment (see

            Figure&nbsp;2.8 shows two capacities for the Trans Mountain
            pipeline; one assumes no shipments of heavy crude oil and the other
            assumes 20&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent heavy crude oil. When heavy crude oil
            is shipped, it reduces the capacity of the pipeline. On average,
            in&nbsp;2008 approximately 25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of Trans Mountain's
            crude oil receipts at Edmonton were heavy crude oil.
          </p>
          <p>

            The Express system consists of two pipelines, the Express Pipeline
            and the Platte Pipeline. The Express pipeline originates in
            Hardisty, Alberta and transports crude oil to markets in Montana,
            Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. The Express Pipeline connects with the
            Platte Pipeline at Casper, Wyoming for deliveries to refineries
            located in Kansas and Illinois. Express has been operating below its
            capacity of 44&nbsp;900&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (280&nbsp;Mb/d) over the past
            several years due in part to apportionment downstream on the Platte
            Pipeline.

            approximately 78&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of capacity (Figure&nbsp;2.9).
            Currently, Express is the only crude oil pipeline in western Canada

            The capacity of TNPI is difficult to calculate because it has

            capacity is 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (132&nbsp;Mb/d); from
            Farran's Point to Belleville the capacity is
            11&nbsp;500&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (72&nbsp;Mb/d); and, from Belleville to

          <p>
            The Cochin pipeline is the largest and longest NGL pipeline in
            Canada. The 3&nbsp;000&nbsp;km pipeline runs from Fort Saskatchewan,
            Alberta, to Windsor, Ontario, and passes through five Canadian
            provinces and seven U.S. states. Cochin has five terminals that
            deliver propane in the U.S and it has access to third-party
            underground storage in Fort Saskatchewan and Windsor. In addition,
            an interconnection with a third-party pipeline in Windsor allows the
            transfer of propane to Sarnia, Ontario.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cochin has operated below capacity since&nbsp;1998 as new export
            pipelines and the expansion of the petrochemical facilities in Fort
            Saskatchewan reduced volumes of NGLs available to the pipeline.
            Ongoing maintenance has affected pipeline capacity. Since
            March&nbsp;2006, the pipeline has been operating at reduced pressure
            after a defect was discovered in the U.S. portion of the pipeline.
            As the pressure restriction has been applied to the entire pipeline,
            ethylene shipments were phased out indefinitely due to its high
            vapour pressure. In February&nbsp;2007, Kinder Morgan announced that
            it would also suspend ethane deliveries commencing at the end of
            March&nbsp;2007, pending evaluation of capital costs to restore the
            pipeline's capacity. Cochin has only transported propane since
            August&nbsp;2007, as butane shipments stopped in&nbsp;2002.

            Kinder Morgan is undertaking a set of measures to improve Cochin
            operations. The first is the implementation of an integrity
            management plan in order to restore ethane transportation capacity.
            The plan looks to inspect the pipeline in segments over a five-year
            period. Each segment will be evaluated, repaired and tested
            hydrostatically to ensure integrity. Once all defects are corrected,
            the company plans to apply to increase the allowed pressure to
            6&nbsp;895&nbsp;kPa (1000&nbsp;psia). Kinder Morgan contemplates
            repeating the process every five&nbsp;years. As well, Kinder-Morgan
            implemented a line fill program in April&nbsp;2008, with the purpose
            of guaranteeing a minimal inventory in the line and improving
            deliverability at the different destination points along the
            pipeline. After its successful implementation in&nbsp;2008, the
            company plans to enhance the program in&nbsp;2009.

            Overall, this indicator shows that there has been adequate pipeline
            capacity to move western Canada volumes to eastern markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Excess capacity provided the impetus for TransCanada's Keystone
            Pipeline project. In this initiative, TransCanada proposed to
            transfer Line&nbsp;100-1 of the Mainline to TransCanada Keystone
            Pipeline GP Ltd. (Keystone) for conversion to oil service. The Board
            approved this transfer and conversion in&nbsp;2007 and construction
            began in&nbsp;2008. The closure of Line&nbsp;100-1 began in
            July&nbsp;2008 and resulted in an annual average capacity reduction
            on the Mainline of approximately 14.2&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;/d
            (0.5&nbsp;Bcf/d), by the end of&nbsp;2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            Including the closure of Line&nbsp;100-1, capacity utilization on
            the TransCanada Mainline was approximately 72&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            in&nbsp;2008, down from 75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in&nbsp;2007.
            Increased consumption of natural gas in Alberta, combined with a
            five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent decline in year-over-year WCSB production
            (approximately 17.6&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (0.6&nbsp;Bcf/d))
            contributed to the continued trend of lower throughput on natural
            gas pipelines leaving Alberta for eastern markets. A remarkable
            7.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase in U.S. production, mainly from
            growth in the shale gas plays of Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas and
            tight sands of Texas and the Rocky Mountain basins, helped to meet
            demand for gas in the U.S. Midwest and eastern markets and reduced
            the demand for Canadian gas.

            transports western Canadian gas supply to markets in the U.S.
            Midwest through a connection with the Northern Border Pipeline Ltd.
            at Monchy, Saskatchewan. Foothills Sask. throughput has displayed
            distinct seasonal patterns in recent years, with annual average

            down from an average of 85&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in&nbsp;2007.
            Until&nbsp;2008, throughput on the Foothills Sask. pipeline had run
            fairly close to capacity in both the winter and the summer months to
            meet winter heating demand and to meet summer demand for power
            generation and storage injection. Throughput subsequently declined
            in the low-consumption spring and autumn months.

          <p>
            In May&nbsp;2008, throughput on this pipeline declined dramatically
            and remained low throughout the summer months. The western leg of
            the Rockies Express pipeline in the U.S. became operational in
            May&nbsp;2008. The Rockies Express pipeline added an average of
            about 28.3&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (1&nbsp;Bcf/d) of natural gas
            from the Rockies region of the U.S. to connecting pipelines
            delivering gas to the Midwest U.S. market, reducing the requirement
            for Canadian gas in that region. Although throughput on the
            Foothills Sask. Pipeline picked up as winter began, the impact of a
            slowing economy cut demand from utilities and industrial users and
            throughput remained lower than traditionally seen on this pipeline.
            Similar to the TransCanada Mainline, the combination of increased
            consumption of natural gas in Alberta, and lower WCSB production
            resulted in less gas available to ship on the Foothills Sask. system
            in&nbsp;2008.

            transported during the peak winter months and less during the
            summer. Flows on Westcoast in recent years have been impactd by
            greater competition with production from the U.S. Rockies region for
            markets in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, mild winter weather, and
            increased hydro power generation in British Columbia and the U.S.
            Pacific Northwest. Flows in&nbsp;2008, however, were up about
            four&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent compared to&nbsp;2007 due to increased
            weather related demand and increased demand for natural gas for
            power generation in both California and the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

            Figure&nbsp;2.15 shows the average monthly throughput and capacity
            on the Foothills South B.C. system, which primarily serves
            California. The average capacity utilization in&nbsp;2008 was
            62&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, slightly lower than in previous years. Spare
            capacity on this pipeline is related to supply competition which has
            reduced demand for exports to the U.S. from the WCSB at Kingsgate,
            British Columbia. California market players have transportation
            options enabling them to access U.S. supply from the Rocky
            Mountains, San Juan and Permian basins, in addition to the WCSB.
            When the western leg of the Rockies Express pipeline became
            operational in&nbsp;2008, gas supplies from areas including the
            Anadarko basin in the Southwestern U.S., which traditionally
            supplied the U.S. Midwest, were forced to seek alternate markets,
            such as California, consequently reducing the requirement for
            Canadian gas in these markets.

            Figure&nbsp;2.16 shows the average monthly throughput on the
            Alliance system relative to available capacity. Alliance offers
            approximately 36.8&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (1.3&nbsp;Bcf/d) of
            firm service capacity and makes any additional capacity available to
            its contracted shippers at a low cost as Authorized Overrun Service
            (AOS). Available AOS levels are determined on a daily basis and may
            be used at the cost of fuel only. The total available capacity
            varies, depending on such factors as ambient temperature and
            compressor unit availability (as influenced by maintenance
            schedules). Alliance's total available capacity has essentially been
            fully utilized since the commencement of service, with all available
            firm service contracted on a long-term basis. In&nbsp;2008,
            throughput on the Alliance system averaged about
            45.7&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (1.612&nbsp;Bcf/d).

            Figure&nbsp;2.17 compares the average monthly throughput and
            capacity on the TQM pipeline. TQM delivers gas from the TransCanada
            Mainline at Saint-Lazare on the Ontario and Quebec border to Quebec
            City and the East Hereford, Quebec export point to New Hampshire.
            This figure illustrates the seasonality of natural gas consumption
            and the variable throughput on this pipeline. Each year, higher
            volumes are transported during the winter months when gas
            requirement for residential and commercial space heating is higher.
            Without abundant underground storage in the region, the pipeline
            system is designed to meet the winter requirement. In the summer,
            gas consumption and flows are typically much lower, resulting in
            spare capacity on the pipeline.

            Historically, the average annual capacity utilization of the TQM
            system has been around 62&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. In November&nbsp;2006,
            the pipeline was expanded to supply a new gas-fired power
            co-generation plant at B&eacute;cancour, Quebec. As a result,
            average capacity utilization increased to about
            67&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in&nbsp;2007. However, following the
            suspension of the B&eacute;cancour Power Plant operation in
            early&nbsp;2008, average capacity utilization of the TQM system
            declined to 53&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. Hydroelectricity surpluses in
            Quebec are expected to continue, making future use of the
            B&eacute;cancour plant uncertain.

            The addition of compression facilities at the Sable Island project
            offshore Nova Scotia, and incremental volumes from the onshore
            McCully field in New&nbsp;Brunswick helped to boost throughput on
            M&amp;NP in early&nbsp;2008. However, ongoing production decline and
            operational difficulties at Sable Island gradually reduced capacity
            utilization in the second half of&nbsp;2008. Although average
            capacity utilization (87&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) on M&amp;NP
            in&nbsp;2008 was higher than in&nbsp;2007, utilization in the second
            half of the year was about 82&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, down from almost

          <h3><a id="s2_3"></a>2.3 Apportionment</h3>
          <p>
            As discussed in this chapter, there is generally adequate capacity
            on NEB regulated natural gas pipeline systems. Unlike natural gas
            pipelines, for the most part oil pipelines operate as common
            carriers. This requires shippers to nominate volumes on a monthly
            basis for delivery into a pipeline without a long-term contract for
            pipeline capacity. There are only a few oil pipelines in Canada that
            operate a portion of their capacity under long-term shipper
            take-or-pay agreements, including Express, Enbridge's Line&nbsp;9
            and TNPI. When shippers nominate more oil or oil products in a given
            month than the pipeline can transport, shipper volumes are
            apportioned (reduced) based on the tariff in effect. Apportionment
            can be caused by factors such as growing supply, increased demand,
            pipeline reconfigurations, reduced pipeline capacity or refinery
            maintenance. Apportionment levels for Enbridge and Trans Mountain
            are discussed below.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s2_3_1"></a>2.3.1 Enbridge</h4>
          <p>
            Enbridge currently has five pipelines that originate in Alberta.
            Line&nbsp;1 transports NGLs, synthetic crude oil and refined
            petroleum products; Line&nbsp;2 ships light crude oil; Lines&nbsp;3
            and&nbsp;4 are dedicated to transporting heavy crude oil; and,
            Line&nbsp;13 ships light crude oil. Line&nbsp;13 terminates at
            Clearbrook, Minnesota while the other lines extend to Superior,
            Wisconsin where lines&nbsp;5, 6, and&nbsp;14 begin and provide
            service to the market hubs of Chicago, Illinois and eastern Canada.
            In January&nbsp;2009, Line&nbsp;65 began shipping light sour and
            medium crude oil, adding 29&nbsp;500&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (186&nbsp;Mb/d)
            of additional capacity from Cromer, Manitoba to the U.S. border.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge throughput from March&nbsp;2008 to March&nbsp;2009 shows
            that there was some apportionment on the system during this
            timeframe (Table&nbsp;2.1). In the fourth&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;2008,
            very high throughputs on the Enbridge system resulted in
            apportionment on Lines&nbsp;2B, 3 and&nbsp;13B. In addition, the
            Enbridge system was close to apportionment in October and November;
            however, this was averted through the cooperative efforts of the
            shippers and Enbridge.

            There was some apportionment on the Enbridge system in the
            first&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;2009. In January, there was apportionment
            due to supply increases of light and heavy crude oil; however,
            reduced nominations due to a number of Force Majeure claims resulted
            in apportionment being lifted. Apportionment on the pipeline that
            transports light crude oil was a result of expected increases in
            Syncrude production volumes and some additional light sweet
            production. In February, Canadian Natural Resource Ltd.'s Horizon
            project began producing synthetic crude oil, adding to throughputs
            on the Enbridge system. There were also forecast increases in Cold
            Lake production and additional heavy crude oil projects coming
            on-stream.
          </p>
          <p>
            During&nbsp;2008, there were several Enbridge pipeline projects

          <p>
            Unlike most crude oil pipelines, capacity on the Trans Mountain
            pipeline system is allocated based on delivery destination:
            Westridge Dock or Land Destinations. Deliveries to the Westridge
            Dock are loaded onto marine vessels. Due to the unique nature of
            these marine deliveries, capacity allocated is a deemed volume based
            on vessel size, currently 8&nbsp;270&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (52&nbsp;Mb/d),
            the equivalent of four tanker-sized cargoes and two barge-sized
            cargoes. Dock nominations are apportioned on an all-or-nothing basis
            based on a Bid Premium process when capacity allocated for Dock
            deliveries is over-nominated.<sup>[6]</sup>
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [6] When nominating volumes for delivery into tankers or barges over
            the Dock, shippers are required to submit a bid price (cents per
            m&sup3;) that they are willing to pay to win the space, should
            capacity for deliveries to the Dock be over-subscribed. During
            months of apportionment for Dock deliveries, space is awarded on an
            all or nothing basis to the shippers who submit the highest premium
            bid values (bid price times volume) in each of the two
            sub-categories, barge and tanker. The number of bids accepted is
            dependant upon the current deemed volume allocated to the Dock.

          <p>
            The remainder of the capacity on the Trans Mountain system is
            allocated for deliveries to Land Destinations. As shown in
            Table&nbsp;2.2, up to and including October&nbsp;2008, apportionment
            on Trans Mountain to Land Destinations was calculated separately for
            deliveries to British Columbia (Domestic Destinations) and to the
            four Washington State pipeline-connected refineries (Export
            Destinations). In November&nbsp;2008, following the release of the
            RH-4-2008 decision, Domestic and Export Destinations were combined
            into a single Lands Destination category apportioned on a
            <em>pro rata</em> basis for capacity allocation purposes.

            Trans Mountain was under apportionment several times
            during&nbsp;2008, and again in March&nbsp;2009. Most of this
            apportionment, including the March&nbsp;2009 apportionment, was
            applied on nominations to the Dock. Apportionment on Dock
            nominations reflects the continuing increase in oil sands supply and
            associated demand for increased shipments to export markets
            accessible by marine vessel. In&nbsp;2008, there were 40 tanker
            shipments off the Westridge Dock. The large number of tanker
            shipments was largely driven by price weakness in the U.S. Midwest
            (PADD&nbsp;II) and an increasing interest in testing western
            Canadian crude oil in refineries located in Asia. In October and
            November, capacity became available due to operational issues at
            storage facilities located at Edmonton. In January and
            February&nbsp;2009, throughputs were reduced due to refinery outages
            in the Puget Sound area.

            An efficient pipeline transportation system should have an ability
            to respond on a timely basis to changing market conditions. This may
            invite proposed adjustments to pipeline capacity or enhancement of
            pipeline services.

          <h4><a id="s2_4_1"></a>2.4.1 Oil Pipelines</h4>
          <p>
            The current global economic downturn has led to the delay of many
            oil sands projects and, correspondingly, expectations of slower oil
            production growth. Oil sands production, however, continues to grow
            with ongoing investment. To address the need for increased capacity
            and greater flexibility, a number of pipeline applications were
            filed and approved by the Board in&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008; that
            infrastructure is now being built. In addition to these projects,
            there are new proposals currently before the Board and potential
            projects yet to be filed.

            In November&nbsp;2007, Keystone filed an application with the Board
            to expand and extend its Keystone Pipeline. The application was
            approved by the Board in July&nbsp;2008 and received Governor in
            Council (GiC) approval in September&nbsp;2008. The project will
            expand the pipeline's capacity to 94&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d
            (590&nbsp;Mb/d) and extend the U.S. portion from the Nebraska/Kansas

            In February&nbsp;2009, Keystone filed an application with the Board

            pipeline system to the U.S. Gulf Coast. If approved, Keystone XL
            would have an initial capacity of 111&nbsp;300&nbsp;m&sup3;/d
            (700&nbsp;Mb/d) and provide transportation from western Canada to
            the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result of its open season, Keystone

          <p>
            While 2008 saw continuing declines in Canadian conventional natural
            gas supplies, the magnitude of U.S. natural gas production growth
            was unexpected, particularly from unconventional sources including
            shale gas. Consequently, increasing attention is being focused on
            large potential shale gas resources in several areas of Canada,
            including Quebec, Alberta and B.C. While positive exploration
            results were seen in all of these areas, only the Montney Formation
            of British Columbia has been producing significant amounts of shale
            gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of the success of shale gas exploration and production,
            the Board has received recent applications for new pipelines seeking
            to gather natural gas from producing and prospective Montney areas
            of British Columbia, as well as from other gas producing formations
            nearby. These pipelines would connect with existing pipeline
            infrastructure in Alberta. Hearings for the Spectra Energy
            Transmission South Peace Pipeline and the SemCAMS Redwillow ULC
            Redwillow Pipeline took place in&nbsp;2008. The Board approved the
            South Peace Pipeline in November&nbsp;2008 and the Redwillow
            Pipeline in March&nbsp;2009.
          </p>

            On the east coast of Canada, EnCana Corporation began preparations
            for the Deep Panuke pipeline project that will bring gas from
            offshore Nova Scotia to Goldboro, Nova Scotia. In New Brunswick,
            construction of the Emera Brunswick Pipeline, designed to connect
            the Canaport LNG terminal to the M&amp;NP Mainline, was completed
            and became available for service in January&nbsp;2009. Right-of-way
            clean up and restoration activities will take place during the
            summer of&nbsp;2009.

            In February&nbsp;2009, the Board approved TransCanada's 2008
            application for federal regulation of its Alberta System (NGTL).
            Previously, NGTL was provincially regulated by the Alberta Utilities
            Commission in conjunction with the Energy Resources Conservation
            Board. Following GiC approval of the certificate, the Board assumed
            jurisdiction over the 23&nbsp;000&nbsp;km pipeline network on
            29&nbsp;April&nbsp;2009.

          <p>
            The Board has recently published an Energy Market Assessment on the
            dynamics of global natural gas and LNG markets, the likelihood and
            availability of future LNG imports to North America and the
            potential implications for Canadian natural gas markets and LNG
            development.<sup>[7]</sup> The report suggests that although current
            North American regasification capacity significantly exceeds
            historical import levels, growth in LNG imports may provide a supply
            alternative, particularly in regions with limited pipeline or
            production capacity.

          <p>
            A well functioning pipeline transportation system has adequate
            pipeline capacity in place to move products to consumers who need
            them. The material discussed in this chapter indicates that,
            overall, adequate capacity did exist on major NEB-regulated
            pipelines in&nbsp;2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Oil Pipelines</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While capacity utilization indicators show there was some spare
            capacity on selected oil and petroleum products pipelines
            in&nbsp;2008, periods of apportionment on certain systems indicate
            that overall capacity remained tight. In&nbsp;2008 and the
            first&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;2009, both Trans Mountain and Enbridge added
            additional pipeline capacity, thereby easing the capacity strain
            that had been in place for several years. Export prices for Canadian
            light and heavy crude oil in&nbsp;2008 tracked domestic posted
            prices closely indicating that, although pipeline capacity was tight
            and at times some systems were under apportionment, adequate
            capacity did exist overall.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current global economic downturn has led to the delay of many
            oil sands projects and, correspondingly, expectations of slower oil
            production growth. Oil sands production, however, continues to grow
            with ongoing investment. To address the need for increased capacity
            and greater flexibility, a number of pipeline applications were
            filed and approved by the Board in&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008; that
            infrastructure is now being built and will add capacity as early as
            the fourth&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;2009.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Natural Gas Pipelines</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the comparison of price differentials and natural gas firm
            service tolls and throughput versus capacity on NEB-regulated
            natural gas pipelines shows that pipeline capacity is adequate
            across the country, although there may be occasions of short-term
            limitation at some points depending upon markets, storage and
            seasonal shifts. The demand for natural gas varies seasonally and,
            as a result, the flow of natural gas and utilization of some
            Canadian pipelines can be variable. Where available, the use of
            storage helps to stabilize flows and allows pipeline capacity to be
            used more efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pipeline utilization declined for most natural gas pipelines
            in&nbsp;2008. Declining conventional supply from the WCSB, growing
            demand within western Canada, and competition from other supply
            basins, particularly in the western and southern U.S., resulted in
            reduced flows on pipelines transporting gas from western Canada.
            Changing supply and demand dynamics may have important implications
            for both new and existing pipeline systems, including possibly
            challenging transitions with respect to utilization and tolls.
          </p>
          <p>
            In comparison to previous years, 2008
            showed&nbsp;fewer&nbsp;applications for new&nbsp;NEB-regulated
            natural gas pipelines. Recent applications&nbsp;in western
            Canada&nbsp;sought to connect new unconventional production
            in&nbsp;northeast&nbsp;BC to markets via connections to existing
            pipelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other applications&nbsp;sought to
            enhance delivery of North American gas to&nbsp;markets in central
            Canada.

          <h2 id="s3">3. Pipeline Tolls and Shipper Satisfaction</h2>
          <p>
            The Board utilizes a number of indicators to assess whether pipeline
            companies are providing services that meet the needs of shippers at
            stable and reasonable prices (tolls). This includes monitoring the
            stability of pipeline tolls as indicated by year-to-year variations
            in the benchmark toll for each of the major NEB-regulated pipelines,
            direct shipper feedback received through response to the NEB's
            annual survey on pipeline services, and via formal complaints and
            informal discussions with shippers and stakeholders.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s3_1"></a>3.1 Negotiated Settlements</h3>
          <p>
            The Board's current Guidelines for Negotiated Settlements were
            issued in June&nbsp;2002, when they were updated to provide
            flexibility to address contested settlements.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the major pipelines regulated by the Board were operating
            under negotiated settlements during&nbsp;2008, with the exception of
            TQM, which filed a partial settlement for the years&nbsp;2007
            to&nbsp;2009. The settlement excluded cost of capital items
            (Figure&nbsp;3.1). The Board held a public hearing in the fall
            of&nbsp;2008 to deal with TQM's application for approval of the cost
            of capital that it would utilize in the calculation of final tolls
            for services provided in&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008. The Board released
            its decision on TQM's application on 19&nbsp;March&nbsp;2009,
            wherein it agreed to vary from its previous methodology with respect
            to TQM's&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008 tolls.

          <p>
            In August&nbsp;2008, Westcoast filed a three-year toll settlement
            for&nbsp;2008 to&nbsp;2010 for services on its mainline transmission
            system. In March&nbsp;2009, M&amp;NP and its stakeholders
            successfully negotiated a one-year toll settlement for&nbsp;2009.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2008, the Board dealt with a few toll-related matters that
            could not be resolved through negotiated settlements. These included
            TQM's cost of capital application mentioned above, an application by
            Enbridge to set tolls on its Line&nbsp;9, an application by Trans
            Mountain related to the disposition of the Westridge Dock premium
            and a further application by Trans Mountain concerning the rules and
            regulations governing capacity allocation and apportionment on its
            system.

          <h3><a id="s3_2"></a>3.2 Pipeline Tolls Index</h3>
          <p>
            Stable and reasonable tolls are a key concern for shippers and
            therefore one of a number of indicators of the hydrocarbon
            transportation system's efficiency. The Board tracks year-to-year
            variations in the benchmark tolls for each pipeline it regulates as
            they may vary for various reasons under cost of service regulation.
            For example, a significant expenditure to modify or expand a system
            to meet shipper's needs could increase or decrease toll levels
            depending on the specific circumstances. Falling throughput or
            contract demand leading to lower capacity utilization could lead to
            a significant toll increase. The following section reviews
            variations and trends of some NEB-regulated pipelines
            since&nbsp;2001.

            [9] Differing pipeline distances add to the challenges in comparing

            The Enbridge benchmark tolls have risen overall during the period,
            growing at a faster pace than the GDP deflator between&nbsp;2002
            and&nbsp;2006. The tolls increased most in&nbsp;2004 and&nbsp;2006.
            Tolls in&nbsp;2008 are slightly lower than those in&nbsp;2007. This
            decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the revenue requirement
            caused by prior year adjustments, which are partially offset by
            costs associated with the Southern Access Expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trans Mountain's benchmark toll rose in&nbsp;2002 and&nbsp;2003 then
            declined until experiencing an increase in&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008.
            The&nbsp;2008 tolls increased an average of 10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            over the 2007&nbsp;tolls largely because the costs for the Pump
            Station Expansion and Anchor Loop Expansion were included in the
            2008&nbsp;revenue requirement. Express's benchmark tolls move
            roughly in line with the GDP deflator from&nbsp;2001 to&nbsp;2008.

          <p>
            TransCanada's benchmark toll tracked the GDP deflator fairly closely
            from&nbsp;2001 to&nbsp;2004. However, in&nbsp;2005 and&nbsp;2006 the
            toll fell, primarily due to increased contract demand. The
            significant increase in TransCanada's 2008&nbsp;toll was due to an
            increase in operating costs combined with a decrease in volumes,
            which was partly due to decontracting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast's tolls increased modestly until&nbsp;2004 then increased
            by over 18&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent due to decontracting of firm service.
            Reductions in volume in&nbsp;2006 caused a further
            32&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase in that year's tolls. In&nbsp;2007,
            tolls held steady at near 2006&nbsp;values and in&nbsp;2008, tolls
            decreased over eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent as contract demand
            increased.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Foothills Zone&nbsp;9 benchmark toll increased in&nbsp;2006
            because of lower volumes and the end of a ten-year&nbsp;period for
            deferred tax payback in&nbsp;2005. The&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008 tolls
            have decreased. The Foothills B.C. System<sup>[11]</sup> benchmark
            toll increased 19&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in&nbsp;2008. This was due to a
            decrease in demand with contract volumes decreasing
            eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent and a clearing of a deferral account from a
            previous year. M&amp;NP's benchmark toll also increased slightly
            in&nbsp;2008 due to a reduction in demand determinates which are
            measures of contract demand on the system taking into account volume
            and distance. The benchmark toll for Alliance increased nearly
            10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent over the 2007&nbsp;toll. This increase was due
            to compressor overhaul expenditures and information systems
            equipment, maintenance and upgrades.

          <p>
            The Board conducted its fifth annual<em>
              Pipeline Services Survey</em
            >
            in early&nbsp;2009 to obtain direct feedback from the shippers of
            major NEB-regulated pipeline and midstream companies on the quality
            of service provided by those pipelines. The Board also uses this
            survey to obtain feedback from shippers on the Board's regulatory
            performance with respect to tolls and tariffs.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each survey received, shippers complete one response which
            reflects their company's corporate views on the services provided by
            the pipeline and midstream company being surveyed and on the
            services provided by the Board. The overall response rate for the
            survey was 38&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, an eight percentage point increase
            over last year. The number of surveys sent out this year
            was&nbsp;421, down&nbsp;52 from last&nbsp;year.
          </p>
          <p>
            After analyzing the survey responses, the Board publishes a summary
            of the aggregate results on its website. It includes the industry
            average and distribution of responses for each question and a
            summary of major themes. In addition, the Board provides each
            company and its shippers with detailed company-specific results
            including the average rating and distribution of responses for each
            question as well as the verbatim comments received from shippers,
            with the names of the respondents excluded.
          </p>
          <p>
            As in previous years, the Board conducted the survey through its
            web-based survey tool. There were no new questions added, however,
            because this is the fifth year the survey has been conducted, the
            Board chose to provide a comparison of the five-year aggregated
            results in this report.

            Figure&nbsp;3.5 shows the aggregate results for the survey question
            that asked shippers to rate their satisfaction with the overall
            quality of service provided by their pipeline/midstream companies.
            This year, the industry average score of 3.67 is higher than the
            score of 3.40 in last year's survey (1 indicates &quot;very
            dissatisfied&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;very satisfied&quot;).
            Approximately 70&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of respondents gave their
            company a rating of satisfied or very satisfied on overall quality
            of service, compared to 60&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent last year. Based on
            these results, the Board is able to conclude that shippers still
            appear reasonably satisfied with the services provided by
            pipeline/midstream companies.

            <strong><em>Feedback on the Board</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2009 survey indicated that shipper satisfaction with the Board
            has decreased slightly compared to last year. Approximately
            65&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of shippers are either satisfied or very
            satisfied with the Board's performance in creating an appropriate
            regulatory framework in which negotiated settlements for tolls and
            tarriffs can be reached. Approximately 55&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of
            shippers are either satisfied or very satisfied with the Board's
            processes to resolve disputes. Both of these results are slightly
            lower than in the 2008&nbsp;survey. Shippers indicated that the
            Board could improve by striving to be more collaborative with its
            stakeholders and more diligent about ensuring all shippers are
            adequately consulted in tolling matters. The Board will consider
            this feedback as part of its ongoing continual improvement efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that a majority of shippers are satisfied with the
            public information provided by the NEB on energy markets.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s3_3_2"></a>3.3.2 Formal Complaints</h4>
          <p>
            If shippers are unable to resolve concerns with a pipeline on
            specific toll and tariff matters, they can file a formal complaint
            with the Board. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the Board
            may decide to deal with it through a formal complaint process before
            the Board, an appropriate dispute resolution process or, in some
            cases, the parties may be able to negotiate a solution to the
            concern on their own. There were two formal shipper complaints
            during the past year involving the Board.

            In October&nbsp;2007, Alliance filed an application with the Board
            for tolls effective 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2008. In December&nbsp;2007,
            ICES filed an objection to Alliance's proposed 2008&nbsp;tolls
            stating Alliance failed to demonstrate that some or all of the
            additional costs that it proposed to recover through its
            2008&nbsp;tolls were reasonable and prudent and, therefore, the
            proposed tolls were not just and reasonable.
          </p>
          <p>
            In April&nbsp;2008, the Board established a written process, which
            was limited to the consideration of ICES's five objections, and
            allowed for the filing of information requests and written argument.
            In September&nbsp;2008, the Board, based on the evidence, dismissed
            the objection of ICES and approved Alliance's proposed tolls
            effective 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2008.

          <p>
            In January&nbsp;2008, EMCE filed a complaint and application in
            respect of the tolls to be charged by Westcoast for gathering and
            processing services in Zones&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2. As tolls for these
            services are negotiated under the Framework for Light-handed
            Regulation and are confidential, EMCE also applied for an order
            directing confidentiality of the information filed with the Board.
            While the matter was before the Board, EMCE and Westcoast continued
            to negotiate in order to reach a settlement. In October&nbsp;2008,
            EMCE advised the Board that negotiations had resulted in resolution
            of the dispute between the parties.

          <h4 id="s3_3_3">3.3.3 Service Enhancements</h4>
          <p>
            As part of its negotiated settlement for&nbsp;2008 to&nbsp;2010,
            Westcoast and its stakeholders agreed to negotiate the terms of a
            Customer Service Incentive Program for transmission services
            provided by Westcoast in Zones&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4. The purpose of the
            program is to improve the overall quality of Westcoast's customer
            service by creating positive and negative financial incentives for
            Westcoast tied to agreed-upon performance measures, including a
            customer survey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also included in Westcoast's settlement were three initiatives to
            enhance service. These initiatives were: (1)&nbsp;to investigate the
            scope and requirements necessary for Westcoast to introduce
            enhancements to its nominations cycle; (2)&nbsp;to reconcile and
            possibly adjust the current level of contractible capacity in
            Zones&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4 on a segment-by-segment basis; and&nbsp;(3)
            to work with its Toll and Tariff Task Force to implement a proposal
            regarding summer reliability targets.

          <h3><a id="s3_4"></a>3.4 Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>The following observations are made in this chapter:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pipeline companies and shippers were able to resolve the vast
              majority of their toll and tariff issues through the negotiated
              settlement process.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Board dealt with a few contentious toll and tariff
              applications that could not be resolved through negotiated
              settlements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Overall, pipeline tolls in&nbsp;2008 increased over the previous
              year with gas pipeline tolls increasing on average more than oil
              pipeline tolls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shippers indicated an increased level of satisfaction with the
              services provided by their pipeline/midstream companies
              in&nbsp;2008.
            </li>
            <li>
              The five-year comparison of Overall Quality of Service indicates
              that, while shipper satisfaction with pipeline services had
              declined slightly over the three previous years, it did improve in
              the last&nbsp;year.
            </li>
            <li>
              There were two formal shipper complaints last year involving the
              Board.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Based on these observations, the Board concludes that
            pipeline/midstream companies are providing services that meet the
            needs of shippers at reasonable tolls. The increase in the
            2009&nbsp;survey scores does indicate that pipeline/midstream
            companies have improved their level of service to shippers in the
            last&nbsp;year. Shippers are also reasonably satisfied with the
            Board's role in the regulation of tolls and tariffs. Nevertheless,
            the Board continually seeks to improve its processes.

          <h3 id="s4_1">4.1 Common Equity</h3>
          <p>
            A common equity ratio is defined as the percentage of common equity
            in a company's capital structure. The market sees this ratio as
            related to a company's financial risk, which is the risk associated
            with a company's use of debt. Higher common equity ratios increase
            the likelihood of a company being able to meet its financial
            obligations, including debt service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Deemed Common Equity Ratios</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Board approves a Group&nbsp;1 pipeline company's tolls for
            a specified time period, it typically has also approved a return on
            equity (ROE) and a common equity ratio for the regulated entity.
            Since parent companies often have a variety of business lines
            consolidated into one capital structure, an appropriate common
            equity ratio has previously been determined or deemed for the
            NEB-regulated assets.<sup>[13]</sup> Alternatively, some
            Group&nbsp;1 pipeline companies may successfully negotiate a
            comprehensive tolls settlement with their shippers that includes
            capital structure and return on equity. In these instances, the
            Board still considers the overall settlement for approval.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [13] A deemed common equity ratio is a notional capital structure
            used for rate-making purposes that may differ from a company's
            actual capital structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Table&nbsp;4.1 shows the deemed common equity ratio for some NEB
            Group&nbsp;1 pipeline companies. The deemed common equity ratios for
            TransCanada Mainline and Westcoast Transmission increased
            between&nbsp;2006 and&nbsp;2007 while M&amp;NP's ratio increased
            in&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008. M&amp;NP's 2009 deemed equity ratio was
            not specified in its 2009&nbsp;toll settlement. The market considers
            increases to be credit positive, lowering the financial risk of the
            pipeline companies.

            For NEB-regulated pipeline companies the ROE is approved by the
            Board and determined through either adjudication or negotiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board establishes an approved-ROE annually, using a formula
            outlined in the Reasons for Decision for hearing RH-2-94. It is
            applicable to all regulated pipelines except for those with
            alternative rates approved by the Board. Achieved ROEs may vary from
            NEB-approved levels for various reasons such as throughput changes,
            incentives, profit-sharing mechanisms and cost variances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Table&nbsp;4.2 shows the achieved ROE for several NEB-regulated
            pipeline companies from&nbsp;2004 to&nbsp;2008 as well as the ROE
            approved by the NEB in accordance with the RH-2-94 Formula.<sup
              >[14]</sup
            >
            Achieved ROEs from Enbridge, Trans Mountain and Trans-Northern are
            not included in Table&nbsp;4.2 as those companies are not required
            to submit Financial Surveillance Reports to the NEB, as per their
            negotiated settlements. Alliance and M&amp;NP, which are included
            but not subject to the RH-2-94 Formula, have negotiated ROEs with
            their shippers.<sup>[15]</sup> Westcoast's Field Services Division,
            also not subject to the ROE Formula, is financially regulated on a
            complaint basis as described in the
            <em>Framework for Light-handed Regulation </em>(RHW-1-98). Its tolls
            for gathering and processing services are negotiated individually
            with shippers. TransCanada uses the RH-2-94 Formula as a basis for
            their negotiated settlements that also include some incentives,
            resulting in some variation from the Formula rate.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [14] The formula used to determine the ROE for certain NEB-regulated
            pipelines, established in the RH-2-94 Proceeding, and later amended
            to eliminate rounding.<br />
            [15] The Board subsequently approved these settlements. M&amp;NP had
            a base return on equity of 11.66&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for&nbsp;2008;
            12&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for&nbsp;2007; and up to and
            including&nbsp;2006, its base rate was 13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent with
            incentive potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            The RH-2-94 Formula produced an ROE of 8.71&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            for&nbsp;2008 and 8.57&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for&nbsp;2009. Settlements
            using the RH-2-94 Formula as the allowed ROE have varying degrees of
            incentives and risks that cause pipelines' return to differ from the
            Formula ROE. As a result of the various incentives, most
            Group&nbsp;1 pipelines have achieved actual ROEs that are greater
            than their allowed ROEs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of Alliance, the ROE had been fixed for an extended
            period. &nbsp;Initially it was set at 11.25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, as
            shown in Table&nbsp;4.2 for&nbsp;2004 to&nbsp;2006. For the
            years&nbsp;2007 and&nbsp;2008, it increased to
            11.26&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. This change in ROE was the result of a
            decrease in final construction costs. The achieved ROE for M&amp;NP
            has fluctuated over the past five&nbsp;years, first increasing each
            year from&nbsp;2004 to&nbsp;2006, then decreasing from&nbsp;2006
            to&nbsp;2008.

          <h3><a id="s4_2"></a>4.2 Financial Ratios</h3>
          <p>
            Financial ratios, based on financial statement information, can be
            useful when describing a company's performance and financial
            integrity. The evaluation of financial ratios is most meaningful
            when the ratio of a particular company is compared with a benchmark
            or industry standard over time. A variety of ratios can be used to
            evaluate a company's liquidity, operating performance, growth
            potential, and risk. Care must be exercised in the collection and
            interpretation of these financial ratios as reported financial
            information may pertain to a parent company and include
            non-regulated assets and/or assets from different industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Financial risk is the risk inherent in a company's use of debt and
            other obligations where fixed payments are used. It differs from
            business risk, which is the risk attributed to the nature of a
            particular business activity and, for pipelines, typically includes
            supply, market, regulatory, competitive and operating risks.
            Financial risk increases as the proportion of debt increases
            relative to shareholders equity. An increase in debt may obligate a
            company to make more and larger fixed payments in the future. From a
            bondholder's perspective, a company with above average financial
            risk could have problems making interest payments. From an equity
            holder's perspective, a company's level of debt coverage gives some
            indication of the sustainability and value of the equity, and
            possible ability to pay dividends. A company's financial risk may be
            described by ratios such as interest coverage, fixed-charges
            coverage and cash flow-to-total debt and equivalents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following sections specifically outline and discuss certain
            ratios relating to the financial risk of certain companies with
            NEB-regulated pipelines.

          </p>
          <p>
            An interest coverage ratio describes a company's ability to make
            interest payments and repay its debt obligations. It is defined as
            earnings before interest and taxes divided by interest charges. A
            fixed-charges coverage ratio also describes the ability to make
            interest payments and repay debt obligations, as well as considering
            some of the other types of fixed payments a company is obligated to
            make. It is defined as earnings before interest, fixed charges and
            taxes, divided by interest and fixed charges. Higher ratios indicate
            a higher likelihood the company will meet its obligations and may
            indicate there is unused borrowing capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fixed-charges coverage ratios for some NEB-regulated pipeline
            companies, as calculated by the Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS),
            are shown in Figure&nbsp;4.2.<sup>[18]</sup> Complete data is not
            available consistently for all companies: Enbridge Mainline is shown
            separately from the consolidated company Enbridge Inc. and the
            information for Trans Mountain is no longer available on a
            stand-alone basis, therefore its new owner, Kinder Morgan Energy
            Partners L.P., is shown. The average fixed-charges coverage ratio
            for the first six months of&nbsp;2008 is&nbsp;2.97, which is an
            11&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase from the December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2007
            fixed-charges coverage ratios for these companies.

            The cash flow-to-total debt and equivalents ratio is another way of
            describing a company's ability to meet its debt obligations and
            fixed payments. It is defined as operating cash flow divided by
            total debt and debt equivalents.<sup>[19]</sup> Again, higher ratios
            indicate an increased likelihood of a company being able to meet its
            obligations and indicate that it has greater borrowing capacity.

            The cash flow-to-total debt and equivalents ratios for some

            in Figure&nbsp;4.3. As noted earlier, this ratio is not available
            for all pipeline units. The average cash flow-to-total debt and
            equivalents ratio for these companies was 17.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            for the partial year ending June&nbsp;2008, a six and a
            half&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase from the year ending
            December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2007. For most companies, the trend has been
            increasing for cash flow-to-total debt and equivalent ratios. The
            data for Westcoast includes the gathering and processing income
            which is more volatile than the transmission income.

          <h3><a id="s4_3"></a>4.3 Credit Ratings</h3>
          <p>
            In Canada, pipeline credit ratings are determined by three
            independent credit rating agencies: DBRS, Standard &amp; Poor's
            (S&amp;P), and Moody's. Credit ratings provide an assessment of the
            probability a debt issuer will live up to its obligations and, as
            such, indicate the financial integrity of the rated company. A
            company's credit rating generally reflects the consolidated
            operations of the entire company, not just the regulated portion.
            Consequently, the credit ratings for companies such as Enbridge,
            TransCanada and Westcoast, which have both regulated and
            non-regulated operations, may be influenced by their non-regulated
            operations. Credit ratings are somewhat subjective in that a
            company's ratings are the expert opinion of the credit rating
            agency, which may result in different ratings by different agencies.
            See Appendix&nbsp;3 for a comparison of the rating scales for DBRS,
            S&amp;P, and Moody's.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>DBRS</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            According to its published data, in assigning a credit rating to a
            particular company, DBRS attempts to consider all meaningful factors
            that could impact the risk of maintaining timely payments of
            interest and principal in the future. Key credit considerations will
            vary from industry to industry nevertheless, some of the common
            factors considered for most ratings are core profitability, asset
            quality, strategy and management strength, and the financial and
            business risk profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following specific factors are also considered for pipelines
            when deriving their credit ratings: regulatory factors, competitive
            environment, supply and demand considerations, and regulated versus
            non-regulated activities. The credit ratings for most Group&nbsp;1
            pipeline companies are shown in Table&nbsp;4.3 and indicate that
            ratings have remained stable from&nbsp;2004 to the present, varying
            from&nbsp;A(low) to&nbsp;A(high), with no recent rating changes.

            According to its published data, S&amp;P indicates that its credit
            rating reflects a borrower's capacity and willingness to meet its
            financial commitments on a timely basis. S&amp;P bases its ratings
            on the overall creditworthiness of a consolidated company.
            Therefore, the rating of a wholly-owned subsidiary, in the absence
            of meaningful ring-fencing measures, generally reflects the
            creditworthiness of the parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            In S&amp;P's rating methodology, a company rated 'A' has strong
            capacity to meet its financial commitments but is somewhat more
            susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and
            economic conditions than companies in higher-rated categories, such
            as&nbsp;'AA' or&nbsp;'AAA'. Companies rated 'BBB' have adequate
            capacity to meet their financial commitments. However, adverse
            economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to
            lead to a weakened capacity of the company to meet its financial
            commitments.

            <strong><em>Moody's</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            According to its published data, Moody's indicates that its credit
            analysis focuses on the fundamental factors and key business drivers
            relevant to an issuer's long-term and short-term risk profile. The
            foundation of Moody's methodology rests on two basic considerations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the risk to the debt holder of not receiving timely payment of
              principal and interest on the specific debt security; and
            </li>
            <li>
              a comparison of the level of risk with that of all other debt
              securities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Like S&amp;P, Moody's focuses its ratings on the overall
            creditworthiness of the consolidated entity. In so doing, Moody's
            measures the ability of an issuer to generate cash in the future,
            thus its primary focus is on the predictability of future cash
            generation. This determination is built on an analysis of the
            individual issuer and of its strengths and weaknesses compared to
            those of its peers worldwide. An examination of factors external to
            the issuer is also conducted, including industry or country-level
            trends that could impact the entity's ability to meet its debt
            obligations. Of particular concern is the ability of management to
            sustain cash generation in the face of adverse changes in the
            business environment.

            The rating histories for several Group&nbsp;1 pipeline companies are
            provided in Table&nbsp;4.5. All of Moody's ratings place these
            pipelines in the investment grade category and range from 'medium
            grade' to 'upper-medium grade'.

            In June&nbsp;2008, Moody's downgraded the ratings of TransCanada's
            unsecured debentures from A2 to A3. According to TransCanada's
            <em>Quarterly Report to Shareholders - Second&nbsp;Quarter, 2008</em
            >, the downgrade occurred after its announcement to acquire
            Ravenswood. Moody's undertook a review of TransCanada and its
            subsidiaries and subsequently assigned it the lower rating; however,
            it also assigned it a stable outlook.

          <p>
            The pipeline sector in&nbsp;2008 was financially sound. Credit
            ratings continued to be investment grade and key financial ratios
            remained stable.

          <p>The following observations are made in this chapter:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fixed-charges and cash flow-to-total debt and equivalents coverage
              ratios have remained stable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deemed common equity ratios have, for the most part, remained
              stable since&nbsp;2006.
            </li>
            <li>
              Achieved ROEs have, in most cases, been greater than their
              NEB-approved levels.
            </li>
            <li>Credit ratings continue to be investment grade.</li>

          <p>
            Based on this review of&nbsp;2008, the Board believes that, overall,
            the Canadian pipeline transportation system continues to work
            effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board recognizes that this report represents only a snapshot in
            time and does not include a comparison with or to pipeline
            transportation systems in other jurisdictions. As part of its
            mandate, the Board will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the
            transportation system and will continue to meet with parties to gain
            an understanding of all perspectives on this issue. The Board
            welcomes feedback on the measures and conclusions in this report and
            suggestions for improvements to future reports.
          </p>

            This chart provides a comparison of the rating scales used by
            Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P),
            and Moody's when rating long-term debt.

          <p>
            Standard &amp; Poor's provides a Rating Outlook, which assesses the
            potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the
            intermediate to longer term. A 'Positive' outlook means a rating may
            be raised; a 'Negative' outlook that a rating may be lowered; and a
            'Stable' outlook means a rating is not likely to change.

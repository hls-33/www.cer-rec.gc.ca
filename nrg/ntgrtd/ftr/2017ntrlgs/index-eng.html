          <p>
            The National Energy Board&rsquo;s (NEB) Energy Futures (EF) series
            explores how possible energy futures might unfold for Canadians over
            the long term. EF analysis considers a range of impacts across the
            entire Canadian energy system. In order to cover all aspects of
            Canadian energy in one supply and demand outlook, crude oil and
            natural gas production analysis can only be addressed at a
            relatively high level. Supplemental crude oil and natural gas
            production analyses address impacts specific to the supply sector,
            creating an opportunity to provide additional detail and to expand
            the number of cases to cover greater volatility in crude oil and
            natural gas prices and in supply-side technology assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future oil prices are a key driver of future oil production and a
            key uncertainty to the projections in the
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/index-eng.html"
              >Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2017: Energy Supply and Demand
              Projections to 2040</a

            (EF2017). Crude oil prices could be higher or lower depending on
            demand, technology, geopolitical events, and the pace at which
            nations enact policies to reduce GHG emissions.

            EF analysis assumes that over the long term all energy produced,
            given the pricing conditions of the case, will find markets and
            infrastructure will be built as needed to move that energy to
            markets. The timing and extent to which particular markets emerge,
            whether demand growth over/undershoots local production, whether
            export/import opportunities arise, and whether new infrastructure
            for crude oil is built, are difficult to predict. This is why
            simplifying assumptions are made. The analysis in this supplemental
            report continues the EF tradition of assuming these short-term
            disconnects are resolved over the longer term.

            This natural gas production supplemental report includes a detailed
            look at the Reference Case, followed by results from the other five
            cases. In the technology cases, technological advances focus on oil
            sands production and not natural gas; therefore, natural gas prices
            are assumed to be the same in each technology case. Consequently,
            all of the cases except the High Price and Low Price cases have the
            same gas price projection. The natural gas price assumptions in the
            High and Low Price cases differ significantly from the other cases.

          <h3>2.1 Production by Type of Gas</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Canadian gas production has remained steady in the last few years
              despite declining gas prices since 2014 (Figure 2.1). This was
              driven by, in part, drilling to evaluate resources that were
              expected to backstop LNG exports off Canada&rsquo;s West Coast and
              because gas-processing plants were added to help debottleneck the
              gas-gathering system. However, some of this activity is starting
              to fade and total natural gas production in Canada is expected to
              decline slightly into 2021. From there, production starts to
              increase as gas prices<sup id="fn1-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"
                  ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a
                ></sup
              >
              rise and production from new wells starts to outpace production
              declines from older wells. Historical production in Canada peaked
              in 2001 at 495 million cubic metres per day
              (10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d) or 17.5 billion cubic feet per day
              (Bcf/d); in 2016 production was 431 10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
              (15.2&nbsp;Bcf/d) and by 2040 it&rsquo;s projected to increase by
              11% to 480 10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (16.9&nbsp;Bcf/d).
            </li>
            <li>
              Production from the Montney Formation, a large gas resource
              extending from northeast British Columbia (B.C.) into northwestern
              Alberta, has grown significantly over the past five years.
              Production of Montney
              <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#tightgas">tight gas</a> increased
              from no production prior to 2006 to almost 128
              10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (4.5&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2016, or 30% of total
              Canadian natural gas production. The majority of Canadian
              production growth over the projection period comes from the
              Montney, with its production reaching 223 10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
              (7.9&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040, a 74% increase from 2016.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Alberta Deep Basin – a tight gas play which runs along the
              Alberta foothills – produced 96 10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
              (3.4&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2016. Production grows modestly as natural gas
              and natural gas liquids (NGLs) prices increase, reaching 110
              10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (3.9&nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2040.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Duvernay and Horn River shale gas plays currently produce
              small amounts of natural gas; production from both grows modestly
              over the projection period. The Duvernay is an emerging shale play
              in Alberta that contains natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The Horn
              River in northeastern B.C. is more established, but the formation
              lacks NGLs, and is currently uneconomic to drill. Combined,
              production from the two plays increases from 14
              10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (0.5&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2016 to 28
              10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (1.0&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040, with the
              Duvernay making up 85% of the total in 2040.

                >multi-stage hydraulic fracturing</a
              >
              – declines steadily over the projection period as new drilling in
              them is uneconomic using Reference Case price assumptions. Western
              Canadian (WC) conventional production – not including

                >solution gas</a
              >
              – made up 55% of total production in 2006 and 21% in 2016; it
              continues declining to 10% in 2040.
            </li>
            <li>
              Solution gas production is based on Reference Case oil production
              from conventional, tight, and shale oil production (More details
              available here). It increases gradually over the next 25 years,
              making up 14% of total Canadian production in 2040. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Production from the Rest of Canada (ROC) is minimal over the

              marketable natural gas production by province. British Columbia
              natural gas is projected to increase from 4.45&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016
              to 5.51&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. Alberta production is projected to go
              from 10.17&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016 to 10.99&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040.
              Saskatchewan is projected to go from 0.41&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016 to
              0.43&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. Northern Canada is expected to decrease
              from approximately 0.01&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016 to zero by 2026.
              Ontario is projected to decrease from approximately
              0.01&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016 to zero by 2022. New Brunswick is
              projected to decrease from approximately 0.01&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016
              to less than 0.01&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. Nova Scotia is projected to
              decrease from 0.17&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016 to zero by 2021.
              Newfoundland has no marketable natural gas production.

              Natural gas production in Atlantic Canada continues to decline
              over the projection period. Onshore natural gas production in New
              Brunswick falls to near zero by 2040. Offshore natural gas
              production in Nova Scotia is assumed to decline steadily and
              ceases by 2021 for both the Deep Panuke and Sable projects. Given
              relatively high costs for offshore exploration and current
              provincial policies for onshore gas exploration, no new Atlantic
              Canada gas fields are projected to come online.<sup id="fn2-rf"

              Industry focus on deeper resources has increased the average
              initial production (IP) rate of western Canadian gas wells. The
              average IP was lowest in 2006 at 0.54 million cubic feet per day
              (MMcf/d) as many low productivity, shallow wells were being
              drilled (Figure 2.4). In contrast, the average IP for all wells
              drilled in western Canada was 2.2&nbsp;MMcf/d in 2016 – a large
              jump over the last decade because of increased targeting of deeper
              resources with horizontal drilling and

              as operators continue focusing on productive, deeper wells. IPs
              are also expected to trend slightly upward over the projection:

          <h3>2.5 Marketable Natural Gas Resources</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Canada has abundant natural gas resources. With existing
              technology, the amount of remaining marketable gas available to be
              developed as of year-end 2016 is estimated at 1 225 trillion cubic
              feet (Tcf) or over 200 years of supply at current production
              levels. Canada produces 5.6 Tcf per year. From 2017 to 2040 total
              production will be 135 Tcf – just 11% of the potential 1 225 Tcf.
              For the Reference Case, Canadian resources are still projected to
              contain 1 090 Tcf at the end of 2040, or 196 years of production
              at 2016 production levels. See the

              remaining marketable Montney tight gas and 57.12 Tcf are projected
              to be produced over the projection period. At the end of 2016
              there was 63.70 Tcf of remaining marketable other tight gas in
              western Canada and 34.35 Tcf are projected to be produced over the
              projection period. At the end of 2016 there was 370.33 Tcf of
              remaining marketable shale gas in western Canada and 6.31 Tcf are
              projected to be produced over the projection period. In all of

          <ul>
            <li>
              Natural gas production varies between the cases, especially for
              the High and Low Price cases (Figure 3.1). All cases show the same
              focus on more economic deep and tight gas resources. The
              projections for the rest of Canada are the same in all six cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              In all cases except for the Low Price Case, production is expected
              to decline over the short term before eventually increasing from
              year to year to the end of the projection period. In the Low Price
              Case, sub-$4 per million British thermal units gas prices do not
              generate enough capital expenditures to drill sufficient wells for
              production from new wells to outpace the decline in production
              from older wells. As a result, total production declines over the
              entire projection. Production drops to 232 10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
              (8.2&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040 or to about half the amount of the
              Reference Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              The High Price Case projection reaches 845 10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
              (29.8&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040, twice as much as the Reference Case.
              This is largely from a compounding effect over the duration of the
              projection, where higher prices cause more drilling and more
              production – which in turn leads to more revenue. These higher
              revenues generate higher capital expenditures and more drilling
              and production in subsequent years, and so on<sup id="fn5-rf"

              exist and infrastructure will be built as needed and does not
              address the question of where this production would be consumed.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Higher Carbon Price cases have carbon prices going to
              $140/tonne in 2016 dollars by 2040 – almost triple that of the
              other cases&rsquo; carbon price of $50/tonne. However, the effect
              on production is not nearly as much as the effect of the High
              Price or Low Price assumptions.

              gas production and Alberta natural gas price for all six cases.
              The Alberta natural gas price is in 2016 Canadian dollars per
              MMBtu. In the Reference Case price is projected to increase from
              $2.51 in 2016 to $4.77 in 2040, and production is projected in
              increase from 15.23&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016 to 16.94&nbsp;Bcf/d in
              2040. In the Higher Carbon Price Case gas price is projected to
              increase to $4.95 in 2040, and production is projected to increase
              to 15.31&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the Higher Carbon Price and
              Technology Case gas price is projected to increase to $4.95 in
              2040, and production is projected to decrease to 14.76&nbsp;Bcf/d
              in 2040. In the Reference and Technology Case gas price is
              projected to increase to $4.77 in 2040, and production is
              projected to increase to 16.54&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the High
              Price Case gas price is projected to increase to $6.21 in 2040,
              and production is projected to increase to 29.84&nbsp;Bcf/d in
              2040. In the Low Price Case gas price is projected to decrease to
              $3.46 in 2040, and production is projected to decrease to
              8.18&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040.

              of marketable natural gas produced. However, Reference Case and
              Higher Carbon Price case gas production projections remain
              relatively similar (compared to the High and Low price cases),
              mainly because assumed gas prices for the two cases are the same.
              The two technology cases (the Higher Carbon Price + Technology
              case and the Reference Case + Technology case) only consider
              changes to oil sands production methods, and both use the same gas
              price assumptions, so their projected gas production are also
              similar. The only noticeable difference in all these scenarios is
              solution gas production, because carbon prices were assumed to
              affect oil prices and oil production through changes in demand
              (Figure 3.2). The

              This graph shows the projections for Canadian marketable solution
              gas production for all six cases. In the Reference Case production
              is projected to increase from 1.87&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2016 to
              2.41&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the Higher Carbon Price Case
              production is projected to increase to 1.97&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In
              the Higher Carbon Price and Technology Case production is
              projected to decrease to 1.63&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the Reference
              and Technology Case production is projected to increase to
              2.12&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the High Price Case production is
              projected to increase to 4.70&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the Low Price
              Case production is projected to decrease to 0.46&nbsp;Bcf/d in
              2040.

            <li>
              This analysis assumes that over the long term, all energy
              production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as
              needed. However, a lack of markets for Canadian natural gas
              production could reduce the prices Canadian producers receive
              relative to the Henry Hub price and impact gas production
              trends.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              These projections describe what is possible today given price,
              economics, technology, geology, and other assumptions. Actual
              production could be different given other unforeseen factors like
              demand, weather, processing plant outages, etc.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Gas production depends on price, but also on recovery technology
              and drilling efficiency and costs. Should technology or costs
              advance differently than assumed, capital expenditures and well
              production projections would be different than modelled here.<br />

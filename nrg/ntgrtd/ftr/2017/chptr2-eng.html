<p>This chapter  describes the key assumptions underpinning this analysis.</p>
<h2>Key Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Three key assumptions underpin the analysis in  EF2017:
    <ul>
      <li>Over  the long term, all energy production will find markets and infrastructure will  be built as needed.</li>
      <li>Environmental  and socio-economic considerations beyond the included policies and programs are  outside the scope of the analysis.</li>
      <li>EF2017  includes many recently announced climate policies. The following criteria were  applied to determine whether a certain policy was included in EF2017:
        <ul>
          <li>The policy was publically announced prior to 1 January  2017.</li>
          <li>Sufficient detail exists to credibly model a  policy, or reasonable assumptions can be made about the details of a policy.</li>
          <li>Goals and targets, including Canada&rsquo;s  international climate targets, are not explicitly modelled. Rather, policies that  are announced, and in place, to address those targets are included in the  modeling.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/ppndx-eng.html#ta_1">Table A.1</a>, found at the end of this document,  describes many recent climate policy developments and indicates whether that  policy is included in the EF2017 analysis. </li>

<h2 id="s1">Carbon Price Assumptions</h2>
<h3><strong>Climate Policy Developments</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Climate policy in Canada has evolved rapidly  since late 2015. The federal government and many provincial governments made  major policy announcements throughout 2016. </li>
  <li>Several climate policies were announced by the  federal government in the fall of 2016, including:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2016/10/government-canada-announces-canadian-pricing-carbon-pollution.html" rel="external">The  Pan-Canadian approach to pricing carbon pollution </a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/news/2016/11/federal-government-significantly-reduce-greenhouse-emissions.html" rel="external">An  initiative to green the federal government</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2016/11/government-canada-accelerates-investments-clean-electricity.html" rel="external">Amendments  of federal regulations to phase out traditional coal-fired generation by 2030</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2016/11/government-canada-work-provinces-territories-stakeholders-develop-clean-fuel-standard.html" rel="external">A  plan to develop a clean fuel standard</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many provincial governments across Canada also <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/snpsht/2017/01-02rvw-eng.html">announced policies and action plans</a> related to climate change since late 2015. </li>
  <li>Federal and provincial climate policies and  action plans are at various stages of development and implementation. Some  announced policies, such as Alberta&rsquo;s carbon levy on end-use emissions and  Ontario&rsquo;s cap-and-trade  system, had already been implemented at the time of analysis. In other cases,  legislation and regulations are being drafted, or proposals are in the  development and consultation phase. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Carbon Pricing as a Climate Policy  Tool</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In December 2016, the federal government  released the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html" rel="external">Pan-Canadian  Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change</a> (Pan-Canadian Framework). This  outlines Canada&rsquo;s actions that will contribute to meeting or exceeding its 2030  climate change target of a 30% reduction below 2005 <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#greenhousegas">greenhouse  gas</a> (GHG) emission levels. The implementation of <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#carbonppricing">carbon  pricing</a> is a key pillar of the Pan-Canadian Framework.</li>
  <li>Several provinces have already implemented  carbon pricing: Alberta introduced an intensity-based carbon price for large  emitters in 2007, British Columbia (B.C.) began taxing carbon in 2008 and  Quebec&rsquo;s cap-and-trade program came into effect in 2013. Alberta, through a  carbon levy, and Ontario, through a cap-and-trade program, began widespread  pricing of carbon in January 2017.</li>
  <li>In general, carbon pricing mechanisms add a  per-unit-fee to fuels that release GHG emissions when consumed. The fee is  proportional to the GHG emissions released by that fuel. Table 2.1 demonstrates  how different carbon prices impact the price of different fuels.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Carbon pricing can have several outcomes:
    <ul>
      <li>Pricing  carbon raises the price of fuels that emit GHGs, causing a decrease in the use  of those fuels. When carbon is priced, energy users more accurately account for  the cost of releasing GHGs into the atmosphere in their decision making.</li>
      <li>Pricing  carbon alters the relative prices of various fuels to better reflect their GHG  content. As a result, low or no emitting fuels become more attractive when  carbon is priced than if it were not. For example, the carbon price per unit of  energy for natural gas is lower than for gasoline, reflecting the lower carbon  content of natural gas, as shown in Table 2.1.</li>
      <li>A  price on carbon can be a driver of innovation and investment in GHG-emission  reducing technologies. Creating an economic incentive for consumers and  businesses to reduce their carbon costs strengthens the market for products and  services that help reduce GHG emissions.</li>
      <li>Carbon  pricing can be a source of revenue for governments. Revenues can be used for  program spending, including support for the development of carbon-reducing  technologies, or rebates to consumers. Carbon pricing revenue can also be used  to offset other types of taxes, such as personal or corporate income taxes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Economists generally consider carbon pricing to  be an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/migration/cc/content/6/4/7/64778dd5-e2d9-4930-be59-d6db7db5cbc0/wg_report_carbon-20pricing_e_v4.pdf" rel="external">economically  efficient means of reducing GHG emissions</a>. Economic theory suggests that energy  producers, transporters, and consumers who can reduce their GHG emissions at a  cost less than the carbon tax will choose to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Carbon Pricing Mechanisms</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Carbon pricing schemes usually fall into two  main categories: a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system:
    <ul>
      <li>Under  a carbon tax, a jurisdiction sets a price on carbon emissions consistent with  its policy objectives, with a higher price translating into greater expected  emission reductions.</li>
      <li>In  a cap-and-trade system, a government sets a cap on the maximum allowable GHG  emissions and then sets the number of emission permits available equal to that  cap. Market participants must hold permits equal to the amount of GHGs they  emit over a given period. Through trading between many participants, market  forces determine an economy-wide price for GHG emissions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Carbon pricing policies can have drawbacks, some  of which can be dealt with through effective policy design:
    <ul>
      <li>Carbon  pricing can have economic impacts, <a href="https://ecofiscal.ca/reports/provincial-carbon-pricing-competitiveness-pressures/" rel="external">especially  for industrial sectors that are emissions-intensive and face competition in  other jurisdictions</a>. If one jurisdiction introduces a carbon price, trade-exposed  industries may shift their operations to a region with less stringent carbon  policies, resulting in no net reduction in global GHG emissions. This is often  referred to as &ldquo;carbon leakage&rdquo; and is usually addressed by offering free  emission permits to these types of industries. Wider adoption of climate  policies around the world could also reduce this effect by removing the option  for industries to move to another region in order to reduce carbon costs.</li>
      <li><a href="https://ecofiscal.ca/reports/provincial-carbon-pricing-household-fairness/" rel="external">A  price on carbon can be regressive</a>, meaning it could have a  disproportionately negative impact on lower income individuals. The use of  carbon price revenues to provide targeted rebates or other tax cuts can offset this  impact.</li>
      <li>Some  types of GHG emissions, such as methane emissions from agriculture or oil and  natural gas operations, are difficult to measure, making them difficult to  price. <a href="https://ecofiscal.ca/reports/supporting-carbon-pricing-complementary-policies/" rel="external">Other  policy tools such as technology standards are often a more effective tool</a> to address these types of emissions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For an in-depth discussion of carbon pricing in  a Canadian context, the Working Group on Carbon Pricing Mechanisms established  by Canada&rsquo;s
    First Minsters in the Vancouver Declaration released a detailed final report
    on carbon pricing mechanisms in the fall of 2016.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Federal Carbon Pricing Plan in EF2017 </strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Government of Canada announced the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2016/10/canadian-approach-pricing-carbon-pollution.html" rel="external">pan-Canadian carbon pollution pricing benchmark</a> in October 2016 to ensure that  carbon pricing applies to a broad set of emission sources throughout Canada in  2018 with increasing stringency over time.&nbsp; The benchmark provides  provinces and territories with flexibility to implement their own carbon  pollution pricing systems—either an explicit price-based system (a carbon tax  such as the one in British Columbia, or a carbon levy and an output-based  pricing system, such as in Alberta) or a cap-and-trade system (such as those in  Quebec and Ontario). In the benchmark, the federal government also committed to  implement a federal carbon pricing backstop system that will apply in any  province or territory that does not have a carbon pricing system in place by  2018 that aligns with the benchmark. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/technical-paper-federal-carbon-pricing-backstop.html"  rel="external">The  Government of Canada released a discussion paper in May 2017 outlining the  proposed federal carbon pollution pricing backstop system</a>. It is composed  of two key elements:
    <ul>
      <li>A carbon levy applied to fossil  fuels starting at $10 per tonne of GHG emissions in 2018, rising $10 per year  to $50 per tonne in 2022, and</li>
      <li>An output-based pricing system for industrial facilities that emit  above a certain threshold, with an opt-in capability for smaller facilities  with emissions below the threshold. By pricing a portion of emissions and  enabling emissions trading, this component incents innovation and emissions  reductions but mitigates adverse impacts on competitiveness.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>EF 2017 makes several simplifying assumptions on future carbon pricing  in Canada. The actual implementation of the pan-Canadian approach could lead to  different impacts on Canada&rsquo;s energy system than shown here. This report should  not be taken as an official or definitive impact analysis of this initiative.</li>
  <li>All cases in EF 2017 assume that the minimum price for carbon pollution  in Canada varies from $10/tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent  (CO<sup>2</sup>e) starting in 2018 to $50/tonne in 2022. In  the Reference Case, the price for carbon is held at $50/tonne in nominal terms  from 2022 to 2040. </li>
  <li>The Federal Government <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2016/10/canadian-approach-pricing-carbon-pollution.html" rel="external">stated  that the Pan-Canadian approach for pricing carbon pollution will be reviewed in  2022 to confirm the path forward</a>. Following this review, the minimum price  for carbon could change, particularly if other jurisdictions around the world  take similar actions. The HCP Case  explores the  impact on the Canadian energy system of higher carbon pricing than in the  Reference Case over the long term. <strong>This sensitivity analysis is not a  recommendation or endorsement by the NEB of a certain policy direction.</strong> </li>
  <li>The HCP Case assumes that the price for carbon increases steadily after  2022. As shown in Figure 2.1, the minimum price continues to increase at  $5/tonne per year after 2022, reaching $90/tonne in 2030 and $140/tonne by 2040  in nominal terms. In constant 2016 dollar terms, the carbon price in the HCP  Case reaches $68/tonne in 2030 and $88/tonne by 2040.</li>

  <li>Some provinces already are part of, or may join, cap-and-trade systems  for carbon pricing. In these systems the future price of carbon will be  determined by the supply and demand for emission permits. The outlook for this  market price will be uncertain, similar to other market prices such as crude  oil and natural gas. Like crude oil and natural gas prices, EF 2017 makes simplifying assumptions for the future outlook of carbon pricing. The Reference  and HCP cases assume that the price for carbon is equal across all  jurisdictions after 2022, including those with cap-and-trade  systems.</li>
  <li>Implementing a carbon price that  is significantly higher than in other countries can impact the competitiveness  of some Canadian industries. Carbon pricing policies can be designed to offset  this to an extent. Existing carbon pricing plans in various provinces have some  measures in place to mitigate carbon leakage. However, carbon prices well above  those in other countries could still have competiveness impacts. </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/technical-paper-federal-carbon-pricing-backstop.html" rel="external">proposed  approach for the federal carbon pricing &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; system</a> also includes an  element to minimize competitiveness and carbon leakage risks, particularly for  emissions intensive and trade exposed industries. This system provides an  allowable level of emissions for large emitters, and facilities pay for the  emissions above that level or receive credits for their emissions below it.  This system reduces the average carbon cost for these facilities, but maintains  the incentive for emission reductions. In this analysis, emitters face the full  carbon price at an end-user level to capture the price incentive effect, while the  impact of the output based allocations in reducing the income effects of the  carbon prices is captured in the industrial macroeconomic projections. </li>
  <li>The HCP Case assumes that other  countries also increase the strength of their climate policies over time. Given  the competitiveness impacts of higher carbon pricing, it is more likely that  Canada would increase its carbon price if other nations do so as well. Action  on climate in developed countries increases at a similar pace as in Canada.  Developing nations increase the strength of their climate policies more  gradually over the projection period. This assumption also simplifies the  analysis by eliminating concerns related to carbon leakage.</li>
  <li>This sensitivity case is not  meant to replicate scenario analysis that explores the global energy transition  required to keep a global temperature rise to below 2&nbsp;degrees  Celsius, such as the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2016/november/world-energy-outlook-2016.html" rel="external">World  Energy Outlook</a> 450 Scenario. Nor is it a scenario designed with Canada&rsquo;s  international climate targets as the ultimate objective. </li>
  <li>The energy supply and demand results of the Reference and HCP cases are  discussed in Chapter 3: Reference and HCP Case Results. </li>

<h2 id="s2">Technology Case Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Technology&rsquo;s influence on the energy system can  be substantial. Which emerging technologies achieve widespread use is often difficult  to predict. Likewise, the nature of future breakthroughs is unknown. The  adoption rate of emerging technologies is a key uncertainty to the projections  in EF2017.</li>
  <li>Governments in Canada and around the world have emphasized  technological innovation as a key component to their plans to reduce GHG  emissions. A pillar of the Pan-Canadian Framework is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html" rel="external">Clean  Technology, Innovation and Jobs</a>. In addition, Canada is participating in <a href="http://mission-innovation.net/" rel="external">Mission Innovation</a>, a global  initiative, including 22 countries and the European Union, to accelerate global  clean energy innovation. Through its participation in Mission Innovation, Canada  aims to, among other things, double federal investment in clean energy research  and development from 2015 to 2020.</li>
  <li>Several provincial governments have programs to encourage  innovation in energy technology. Examples include SaskPower, <a href="http://www.hydroquebec.com/innovation/en/" rel="external">Institut de recherche  d&rsquo;Hydro-Québec</a>,  Ontario Centres of Excellence, and <a href="http://eralberta.ca/">Emissions Reduction  Alberta</a>. Some of these programs are funded from revenue generated by carbon  pricing initiatives.</li>
  <li>Adoption of new technologies can be encouraged by  climate policies, such as carbon pricing or other options, which improve the  competitiveness of low or non-emitting technologies. Alternatively, a  technology can sometimes become more popular when public or private sector research  and development results in a lower emission technology that is equivalent, or better,  than existing technology for reasons such as cost, convenience, quality, or  societal factors. </li>
  <li>The Technology Case considers the impact of  greater use of a selection of emerging energy technologies on the energy  system. It builds upon the underlying assumptions of the HCP Case, including the  long-term increases in carbon pricing shown in Figure 2.1. </li>
  <li>The Technology Case assumes: 
    <ul>
      <li>Greater  cost decreases for solar and wind electricity generating technology over the  projection period.</li>
      <li>Greater  interprovincial electricity trade and modest penetration of grid-scale battery storage  technologies.</li>
      <li>Faster  uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) in the passenger transportation sector.</li>
      <li>Adoption  of steam-solvent technology in the oil sands sector.</li>
      <li>Greater  electrification of space and water heating in the residential and commercial  sectors.</li>
      <li>Increasing  use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for coal-fired electricity  generation. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These technologies are a selection of the wide  array of emerging technologies that have the potential to increase their market  share over the projection period. They are chosen to illustrate how technological  development may impact energy supply and demand trends in various sectors of  the economy. It is unclear which technologies will gain wider adoption in the future;  these technologies provide an example among many potential outcomes. <strong>This  sensitivity analysis is not a prediction or recommendation of certain technologies</strong>.</li>
  <li>The energy supply and demand results of the  Technology Case are discussed in Chapter 4: Technology Case Results. </li>

<h2 id="s3">Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices</h2>
<h3><strong>Crude Oil</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Crude oil prices are a key driver of the  Canadian energy system and are determined by global supply and demand factors.  Canada is a major <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#crudeoil">crude oil</a> producer and prices are an important driver of future production growth. The  prices of <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#refinedpetroleumproduct">refined  petroleum products</a> (RPPs), such as gasoline and diesel, are closely related  to crude oil prices and can influence energy use trends.</li>
  <li>From 2011 to mid-2014, global crude oil prices  were stable near US$100 per barrel (bbl). Prices dropped steadily starting in  mid-2014, with the <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#brent">Brent</a> crude oil  price falling to less than US$30/bbl in January 2016. The price increased  through the spring of 2016 and stabilized near US$50/bbl through the rest of  2016 and into 2017.</li>
  <li>Figure 2.2 depicts the Brent crude oil price  assumptions in EF2017. The Reference Case price, in constant 2016 dollar terms,  reaches US$80/bbl by 2027, and stays at that level through the remainder of the  projection period. Investment in new crude oil production capacity has declined  in recent years due to low oil prices. As a result, prices increase early in  the projection period as higher prices help to bring on additional production  to balance supply and demand. After 2027, the Brent crude oil price stays at  US$80/bbl reflecting the potential for crude oil demand growth to flatten or begin  declining. </li>

        <summary>Description</summary>
        <p>
        This graph shows Brent Crude Oil prices in 2016 US$ per barrel based on the three cases in EF2017. In all three cases prices increase to 2022 where they hit $71.25/bbl. Prices in the Reference Case then increase until they hit $80.00/barrel in 2027 and remain constant until 2040. In the HCP Case oil prices increase to $75.00/barrel in 2024 then remain constant until 2040. In the Technology Case prices increase until they reach $74.50/barrel in 2025 then they continually fall to $65.00/barrel in 2040.
        </p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>As  shown in Figure 2.2, the Brent crude oil price is lower in the HCP and  Technology cases. In both cases, the Brent crude  oil price follows the trajectory of the Reference Case until 2022. Thereafter,  the prices diverge, with prices in the HCP Case reaching US$75/bbl in constant  2016 dollar terms. The Technology Case assumes that the Brent price begins to  slowly decline, reaching US$65/bbl in 2040, US$15/bbl lower than in the  Reference Case. </li>
  <li>The HCP Case assumes greater global climate  action relative to the Reference Case. This implies lower demand for GHG emission-intensive  goods, including RPPs, and crude oil. Similarly, in the Technology Case, greater  global adoption of technologies like EVs implies lower demand for crude oil  compared to the Reference Case.</li>
  <li>Lower price assumptions in the HCP and  Technology cases highlights that stronger global climate action or greater  adoption of low carbon technologies could reduce the market for crude oil  compared to the Reference Case. For energy consumers, lower crude oil prices  would reduce the costs for RPPs like gasoline and diesel but higher carbon  prices more than offset this, resulting in higher end-use prices for those  fuels. </li>
  <li>The ultimate impact of greater global climate  action, or greater technology adoption, on crude oil prices is highly  uncertain. The differences in crude oil prices between the cases could depend  on future climate policies, the evolution of crude oil supply costs around the  world, and the availability of alternative technologies. </li>
  <li><strong>The difference between the cases in  EF2017 is not an assessment of the impact of greater climate action on crude  oil prices but is an assumption with which to build broad and plausible  scenarios.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Natural Gas</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Natural gas prices have declined considerably  over the past decade. <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#henryhubprice">Henry Hub</a> prices fell from the US$6-9 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) range  between 2006 and 2008 to less than US$4/MMBtu for the majority of the last five  years. In the first half of 2016, Henry Hub prices were as low as US$2/MMBtu  and averaged closer to US$3/MMBtu in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.</li>
  <li>Figure 2.3 shows the Henry Hub natural gas price  assumptions of EF2017. The price in all three cases, in constant 2016 dollar  terms, increases from US$2.45/MMBtu in 2016 to US$4.30/MMBtu in 2040.</li>
</ul>

<details>
        <summary>Description</summary>
        <p>
        This chart shows Henry Hub natural gas prices for all the cases in EF2017. From a low of $2.45 (2016US$ per MMBtu) in 2016 prices continually rise to 2040 where they reach $4.33.
        </p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Natural gas is less GHG-intensive than other <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#fossilfuel">fossil fuels</a>.  Under the assumptions of the HCP and Technology Cases, it is unclear whether natural  gas demand would increase or decrease in response to the assumptions in those  cases. Power producers in North America may choose to replace coal-fired  generation with natural gas to reduce emissions and service higher electricity  demand. Similarly, a global shift towards natural gas could increase demand for  LNG exports from North America, which could increase natural gas prices. On the  other hand, stronger climate policy and technology adoption could reduce demand  for all fossil fuels, including natural gas. Given this uncertainty, the Henry  Hub price assumptions in all three cases are the same.</li>

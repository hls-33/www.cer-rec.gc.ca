  <li>The Technology Case considers the impact of  greater use of a selection of emerging energy technologies on the energy  system. It builds upon the underlying assumptions of the HCP Case and the carbon  price increases steadily throughout the projection period.</li>
  <li>The Technology Case assumes: 
    <ul>
      <li>Greater  cost decreases for solar and wind electricity generating technology over the  projection period.</li>
      <li>Greater  interprovincial electricity trade and modest penetration of grid-scale battery  storage technologies.</li>
      <li>Faster  uptake of EVs in the passenger transportation sector.</li>
      <li>Higher adoption  of steam-solvent technology in the oil sands sector.</li>
      <li>Greater  electrification of space and water heating in the residential and commercial  sectors.</li>
      <li>Increasing  use of CCS technology for coal-fired electricity generation. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li>These technologies are a selection of the wide  array of emerging technologies that have the potential to increase their market  share over the projection period. They are chosen to illustrate how  technological development may impact energy supply and demand trends in various  sectors of the economy. It is unclear which technologies will gain wider  adoption in the future; these technologies provide an example among many potential  outcomes. <strong>This sensitivity analysis is not a prediction or  recommendation of certain technologies.</strong></li>

<h2 id="s1">Technology Developments </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Over the past decade, technological changes have  impacted the energy system in many ways. The widespread application of horizontal  drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing in tight and shale oil and natural  gas resources was among the most impactful; significantly increasing production  of crude oil and natural gas in North America. </li>
  <li>Other technological developments over the past  decade have also influenced energy trends and have the potential to alter the  long-term energy outlook in both Canada and globally. The following section  discusses the specific technologies included in the Technology Case and is  followed by a discussion of the energy supply and demand results.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Renewable Electricity Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Installations of renewable electricity  generation technologies, particularly photovoltaic solar and wind, have increased  significantly around the world over the past decade. Figure 4.1 shows  cumulative global installations of solar photovoltaic and wind capacity. </li>

<ul>
  <li>A total of 1.5 GW of solar was installed globally  during 2006 compared to more than <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html" rel="external">75  GW in 2016</a>. China installed the most solar in 2016, followed by the U.S.  and Japan. A total of 11&nbsp;GW of wind was installed in 2006, compared to 55&nbsp;GW in  2016.</li>
  <li>Accompanying the increasing use of these  technologies has been a decline in costs, particularly for solar photovoltaic  installations. Figure 4.2 shows the estimated costs associated with a utility-scale  solar installation in the U.S. from 2010 to 2017. Total installed costs <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/66532.pdf" rel="external">fell from nearly US$4.5 per  watt in 2010 to nearly US$1 per watt in 2016</a>.</li>

<h3>Improving the Integration of  Intermittent Renewables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Electricity grid operators must constantly keep  electricity production and consumption in balance to ensure the system is  stable and reliable. Energy consumption changes continuously as demand from  homes, businesses, and industry vary constantly. Electricity system operators&rsquo;  main tool to keep the system in balance is to increase or decrease electricity generation  to meet demand. Flexible generation resources, such as some hydroelectric and natural  gas-fired facilities, are most often used to balance supply and demand for  electricity. </li>
  <li>Unlike traditional generation sources, wind and  solar are intermittent. They generate power when the wind is blowing or sun is  shining. This can add to the challenge of balancing supply and demand because,  in addition to fluctuations in electricity consumption, grid operators also  need to accommodate variations in supply from these resources.  </li>
  <li>Figure 4.4 shows an example of hourly generation  in Alberta for a day in autumn 2015, a day with a large swing in wind  generation. In the early hours of the day, almost all generation was from non-wind  sources, primarily coal. Generation increased from 5:00 am to 8:00 am as homes  and businesses increased their electricity use. Throughout the day wind speeds steadily  increased, resulting in higher wind generation and lower non-wind generation. Later  in the evening, total demand decreased while wind generation continued to  increase. Wind was less than 1% of total generation in the morning and over 18%  by midnight. This variability was accommodated by changes in output from other  supply sources.   </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>When the share of intermittent resources is small,  or if a grid has large levels of flexible generation available, fluctuations in  supply are relatively easy to accommodate. However, as the shares of these  resources increases, additional measures to accommodate increasing variability may  be needed. These measures include:
    <ul>
      <li>Building  additional flexible generating capacity, such as natural gas-fired facilities,  that can increase or decrease generation quickly. </li>
      <li>Various  options to manage electricity demand, such as grid operators coordinating with  large electricity users to increase or decrease their electricity use.</li>
      <li>Increasing  transmission interconnections between electricity grids to allow greater  electricity trade to manage variability. </li>
      <li>Building  grid-scale electricity storage facilities that would charge and discharge to  help balance the electricity system. Grid-scale storage includes many  technologies such as pumped hydro, batteries, compressed air and flywheels. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compared to the Reference and HCP cases, the  Technology Case assumes lower costs and modest penetration of grid-scale  lithium ion batteries, greater use of demand management, and the expansion of the  existing electricity interconnection between Alberta and B.C. by 500&nbsp;MW.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Electric Vehicles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The vast majority of vehicles on the road today  utilize internal combustion engines (ICE) which are powered by fossil fuels,  usually gasoline or diesel. EVs are powered by electricity stored in a battery and  use an electric motor to propel the vehicle. </li>
  <li>EVs can include pure electric or hybrid vehicles.  Pure electric EVs are only powered by an electric motor and the battery pack is  charged by plugging into the electricity grid. Hybrids are vehicles that  combine EV and ICE technologies. Plug-in hybrids have a battery that can be  charged via the electricity grid but when the battery is depleted a small  onboard ICE charges the battery to extend the vehicle&rsquo;s range. </li>
  <li>As a passenger transportation vehicle, EVs have  benefits and drawbacks compared to ICE vehicles. EVs have no tailpipe  emissions, meaning they do not directly emit GHGs. However, if the electricity  used to charge an EV is produced with fossil fuels, there would be GHG  emissions associated with operating the vehicle. In some jurisdictions where  coal is the dominant electricity source, charging an EV may result in more GHGs  per kilometre driven compared to a similar sized ICE vehicle. </li>
  <li>Currently, the selection of EVs is growing but  limited compared to ICE vehicles. EVs are also generally more expensive to  purchase, largely as a result of battery pack costs. However, EVs are usually less  expensive to drive per kilometre. This is partly due to higher efficiency of electric  motors compared to ICEs and typically lower costs of electricity relative to  gasoline or diesel in many provinces. </li>
  <li>One challenge with EVs can be the range of the  vehicle, which can impact their usefulness for taking longer trips. The range  of EVs are generally less than ICE vehicles although some with larger battery  packs have comparable ranges. However, ICE vehicles have access to a  well-established infrastructure of service stations to quickly refuel,  accommodating trips further afield. EVs can take longer to charge, ranging from  30 minutes to many hours depending on the type of charger. Publically available  charging stations are less common than refueling stations but their numbers are  growing quickly. Table 4.2 compares some key characteristics of various  electric vehicles and a typical ICE vehicle (Toyota Corolla).</li>

<ul>
  <li> EV sales in  Canada, including plug-in hybrids, were 11&nbsp;500 in 2016. This was 0.6% of all  passenger vehicle sales in Canada in 2016.</li>
  <li>The Reference and HCP cases assume moderate market  penetration of EVs, with the share of light duty vehicle annual sales reaching 3%  in 2020 and 16% in 2040. Sales are stronger in regions of Canada that produce a  large amount of their electricity from non-emitting sources and have EV  policies. Sales grow quickest in Quebec as a result of the province&rsquo;s EV  mandate. </li>
  <li>The Technology Case assumes that recent growth  in EV sales continue to accelerate, with lower battery costs and longer ranges  encouraging greater adoption both globally and in Canada. The Technology Case  assumes annual EV sales of 6% of total sales in 2020, and 47% in 2040. EVs gain  a larger share in the passenger car market initially but also gain some share  of the utility vehicle, light truck, and bus market later in the projection  period. The Technology Case does not assume widespread adoption of autonomous  driving technologies. Figure 4.6 shows the EV sales assumptions in the HCP and  Technology cases.</li>

<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows EV share of new vehicle purchases under both the HCP and Technology Case for solely Quebec, as well as Ontario, Manitoba and B.C. together, and then the remaining provinces. In 2016, the EV shares of new vehicle purchases are  1.08% in Quebec, 0.42% for Ontario, Manitoba, and B.C., and 0.11% for the remaining provinces. Under the HCP Case, these values grow to 29.15%, 16.67% and 6.67% by 2040. Under the Technology Case, the values grow to 48%, 46.50% and 45%.</p>

  <li>In the HCP Case, roughly 16% the passenger  vehicles on the road in 2040 are EVs, or about 3 million vehicles. In the  Technology Case, there are approximately 8 million EVs on the road in 2040, or  about 34% of all passenger vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steam-Solvent Technology in the Oil Sands</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extracting bitumen from the oil sands can be  energy intensive, particularly for in situ operations. In situ oil sands  production involves burning natural gas to create steam, which is then injected  into reservoirs to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen, allowing it to be  pumped to the surface. In recent years, technology and process improvements have  reduced the amount of steam, and hence natural gas, used per barrel. Further  discussion of this trend is available in the &ldquo;Energy Use in the Oil Sands&rdquo;  section in Chapter 2 of <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016/index-eng.html">Canada&rsquo;s  Energy Future 2016</a>.</li>
  <li>The decline in crude oil prices since mid-2014 —  along with the implementation of carbon pricing and a 100&nbsp;MT cap on oil sands  emissions — creates an incentive for oil sands producers to continue to reduce costs  and GHG emissions. <a href="http://resources.ceri.ca/PDF/Pubs/Studies/Study_164_Full_Report.pdf" rel="external">Many  different technologies are being proposed and tested</a> in the oil sands. Steam-solvent  processes are one technology that has potential to reduce in situ supply costs,  natural gas consumption, and GHG emissions.    </li>
  <li>Steam-solvent processes involve combining  solvents, such as propane or butane, with the steam being injected into in situ  reservoirs. Solvent concentrations in the steam can range from 10% to 20%. The  addition of solvents aids in reducing the viscosity of the bitumen in the  reservoir and has shown to improve recovery rates from wells by 10% to 30% compared  to steam alone. The technology also has potential to reduce the energy  intensity of production considerably. Steam-solvent processes differ from <a href="https://www.nsolv.ca/">pure solvent processes</a>, which involve using  only solvents to extract bitumen. </li>
  <li>An in situ project using steam-solvent  technology can have higher upfront costs than a traditional in situ project as  a result of additional facilities to store, treat, and recover solvents. Greater  bitumen recovery rates and lower steam requirements can offset those costs to  varying extents depending on individual project characteristics. The economics  of steam-solvent processes are influenced by the cost of the propane or butane  to be injected. In recent years the price of these commodities, particularly  propane, have been quite low due to increasing production of liquids-rich tight  and shale gas in western Canada. Another factor in the cost effectiveness of  steam-solvent processes is the extent to which the injected solvents can be  recovered from the reservoir. Typical recovery rates are around 70% but can  vary widely. </li>
  <li>Several pilot projects have successfully implemented  steam-solvent technology and some commercial scale projects are under  consideration. Cenovus stated that its <a href="http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oilsands/narrows-lake.html" rel="external">Narrows Lake  project</a>, which was recently deferred due to low oil prices, would employ  steam-solvent technology on a commercial scale. <a href="http://www.imperialoil.ca/en-ca/company/operations/opportunities/opportunities" rel="external">Imperial  Oil&rsquo;s Aspen and Cold Lake</a> expansion projects both propose to apply  steam-solvent processes and are currently under regulatory review.</li>
  <li>The Technology Case assumes that oil sands  producers increasingly use steam-solvent processes. Early in the projection  period, the technology is applied at select expansion projects and is gradually  implemented at existing facilities later in the projection period. Higher oil  recovery rates and lower steam requirements reduce the cost per barrel of  building new or expanding in situ facilities by roughly 30%. For existing  facilities, bitumen recovery rates increase and natural gas consumption  declines as a result of the use of steam-solvent processes. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Greater Electrification of Space and Water Heating </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Several different technologies are used to heat  homes and businesses in Canada. Most are heated using natural gas or oil  furnaces, electric baseboard heating or with wood. The predominant type of  heating in a region is usually determined by the relative costs of fuels and the  infrastructure to deliver those fuels. For example, low electricity prices in  Quebec encourages more electric baseboard heating. In Atlantic Canada, oil  furnaces and electric heat are more common, in part due to limited natural gas  distribution infrastructure. Figure 4.7 demonstrates the heating system types  across Canada.</li>

<p>This graph shows the share of residential heating system type by region, for the year of 2014. The four residential system heating types are heating oil, natural gas, electric and other.

<ul>
  <li>The energy efficiency and GHG intensity of space  and water heating depends on a variety of factors, including heating system  type, the quality of a building&rsquo;s insulation and weather sealing, type of  heating fuel, and local climate conditions. </li>
  <li>Heat pumps operated with electricity are an  alternative technology that can be used for space and water heating. Heat pumps  use similar processes as freezers or air conditioners but can heat a space  rather than cool it. Most heat pumps can both heat and cool as needed. </li>
  <li>The advantage of heat pumps is that rather than directly  creating heat, they exchange energy, extracting heat from an outside source and  pumping it into a space. As a result, a heat pump uses two to five times less  electricity compared to baseboard heating to generate the same amount of heat.  The efficiency of a heat pump depends on the temperature of the medium it is  extracting heat from — the lower the temperature, the more energy it takes to  extract the heat. </li>
  <li>There are two main types of heat pumps: air and  ground source. Air source heat pumps extract heat from the air outside. Ground  source heat pumps are typically part of a geo-exchange system, where the heat  is extracted from a liquid that is pumped through underground pipes which either  absorb or dissipate heat to and from the ground. </li>
  <li>The Technology Case assumes heat pumps  installations increase to 15% of new heating device purchases in 2025, for both  new buildings and retrofits in existing buildings. The share of installations  increase to 30% by 2040.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CCS Technology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CCS technology involves capturing and storing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that would have otherwise been released into  the atmosphere. The carbon is usually stored underground in geological  formations. CCS projects are usually designed to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from large sources of emissions, such as power plants  or natural gas processing plants, to take advantage of concentrated streams of GHG  emissions. Global large scale CCS capacity was <a href="http://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/sites/default/files/publications/201158/global-status-ccs-2016-summary-report.pdf" rel="external">34&nbsp;MT in 2016</a>, which is equivalent to about 5% of Canada&rsquo;s GHG emissions. </li>
  <li>Carbon can be captured using a variety of processes.  Pre-combustion processes convert fossil fuels to hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub>. The hydrogen can then be used for energy or other  processes and the CO<sub>2</sub> stored. Post-combustion  processes involve separating CO<sub>2</sub> from the exhaust  from an industrial facility or power plant using a variety of techniques. There  are also oxy-fuel processes involving combusting fossil fuels in an oxygen-rich  environment, resulting in an exhaust stream of mostly water and CO<sub>2</sub>,  making it easier to recover a concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>  stream suitable for storage. </li>
  <li>In many cases, the CO<sub>2</sub>  stream resulting from CCS is used for other purposes. One common use is for  enhanced oil recovery (EOR), where CO<sub>2</sub> is injected  into oil-bearing reservoirs to increase the amount of oil that can be extracted. </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.saskpower.com/our-power-future/carbon-capture-and-storage/boundary-dam-carbon-capture-project/" rel="external">Boundary  Dam power station</a> in Saskatchewan began operations in 2014. The 115&nbsp;MW  coal-fired power plant is capable of capturing 1.3&nbsp;MT of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. Most of the CO<sub>2</sub>  from the facility is transported to nearby oil fields and used for EOR while  some is also stored underground in geological formations near the plant. In  addition, Saskatchewan has also been <a href="https://www.dakotagas.com/About_Us/CO2_Capture_Storage/" rel="external">importing CO<sub>2</sub>  by pipeline</a> for EOR from a coal gasification plant in North Dakota.</li>
  <li>In Alberta, the <a href="http://www.shell.ca/en_ca/about-us/projects-and-sites/quest-carbon-capture-and-storage-project.html" rel="external">Quest  Project</a> captures CO<sub>2</sub> from Shell&rsquo;s Scotford  upgrader and transports it by pipeline for permanent storage underground. The  project is designed to capture up to 1.1&nbsp;MT of CO<sub>2</sub>  per year or roughly 35% of the upgrader&rsquo;s emissions. Under development is the <a href="http://www.enhanceenergy.com/" rel="external">Alberta Carbon Trunk Line</a>, a 240 km  pipeline that will transport CO<sub>2</sub> from an industrial  area north of Edmonton to EOR projects in central Alberta. Starting in 2018 the  project will transport 1.7&nbsp;MT CO<sub>2</sub> per year captured  from two facilities: the <a href="https://nwrsturgeonrefinery.com/" rel="external">Sturgeon  Refinery</a> (currently under construction) and an Agrium fertilizer plant. The  pipeline has a capacity of nearly 15&nbsp;MT per year to allow for future CCS  projects. </li>
  <li>The Reference and HCP cases include some  additional CCS projects over the projection period. This includes the  retrofitting of the additional coal units at Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, with  units 4 and 5 coming online in 2021 and unit 6 coming online in 2029. The  Technology Case assumes that ongoing research and development in CCS technology  results in lower costs and encourages more CCS capacity to be added over the  projection period. This includes retrofitting Boundary Dam unit 6 with CCS earlier  and additional retrofits of the existing coal-fired generation facilities in  Saskatchewan and Alberta. Figure 4.8 shows total installed capacity of coal-fired  generation with CCS technology installed.  </li>

<h2 id="s2">Technology Case Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Technology Case builds upon the underlying  assumptions of the HCP Case, meaning the carbon price increases steadily  throughout the projection period. As noted in Chapter 2, the Technology Case  assumes that greater adoption of technologies like electric vehicles has an  impact on global crude oil demand. As a result, the crude oil price is lower  than in Technology Case compared to the HCP or Reference cases, reaching  US$65/bbl in 2040.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Lower crude oil prices and production in the Technology Case depreciate  the Canadian-US exchange rate relative to the other cases.  This, along with reduced energy costs due to  the various technologies in the Technology Case, leads to faster economic  growth. However, the overall economic outcomes in all three cases are similar,  despite shifts in the energy system. By 2040, gross domestic product is 0.2%  lower in the Higher Carbon Price Case than in the Reference Case, and 0.1%  higher in the Technology Case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="s4">Residential, Commercial, and Transportation Energy Demand</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The technologies considered in the Technology  Case impact energy use in a variety of ways, and result in a decrease in  end-use energy demand. Total end-use demand in 2040 in the Technology Case is  11 045&nbsp;PJ, or 2.6% lower than in the HCP Case and 9% lower than in the  Reference Case. </li>
  <li>Figure 4.9 shows average annual growth rates for  total end-use demand as well as the four sectors. Energy use grows more slowly  or declines faster than the HCP Case. These trends are a result of the specific  technology assumptions in the Technology Case, as well as the impacts of lower  crude oil prices and changing macroeconomic drivers.</li>

</details>
<h3>Residential and Commercial</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The higher penetration of heat pumps for heating  and cooling in buildings leads to lower energy use in the residential and  commercial sector because that technology heats and cools more efficiently than  conventional natural gas, electric, or oil systems. </li>
  <li>Figure 4.10 compares residential and commercial  electric and natural gas demand in 2040 across the cases. Electricity demand  increases slightly in the Technology Case. Greater electrification of heating  is partially offset by improving the energy efficiency of heating in  jurisdictions such as Quebec that have a high share of electric baseboard  heating. Greater electrification reduces natural gas demand in buildings, which  is 12% lower in the Technology Case compared to HCP Case.</li>

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An increased share of electric vehicles reduces  transportation energy demand in the Technology Case. Total transportation  energy demand in the Technology Case is 3% lower than HCP and over 5% lower  than the Reference Case in 2040. Demand is lower because electric vehicles  typically use less energy per km travelled compared to conventional vehicles.  This impact is muted however due to the lower oil price assumption in the  Technology Case. The resulting lower gasoline and diesel prices encourage more  driving by the remaining conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles.</li>
  <li>Figure 4.11 shows the difference in demand  between the Technology and HCP cases for electricity, gasoline, and ethanol,  which is blended with gasoline. As the share of electric vehicles in  transportation grows, electricity demand increases, offsetting use of gasoline  and blended ethanol. In 2040, electricity demand is 37&nbsp;PJ higher than in the  HCP case, and gasoline demand is reduced by 98&nbsp;PJ. </li>

<h2 id="s5">Crude Oil Production and Industrial Energy Demand</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the Technology Case, oil sands producers  increasingly use steam-solvent technologies for in situ projects. This reduces  the per barrel costs for new projects and expansions of existing projects.  However, the Technology Case also assumes that greater technological adoption  occurs globally, reducing crude oil consumption overall. As a result, crude oil  prices in the Technology Case are lower, reaching US$65/bbl in 2040 compared to  US$75/bbl in the HCP Case and US$80/bbl in the Reference Case. Lower supply  costs are partially offset by the lower price assumptions in the Technology  Case and production reaches 416&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (2.6 MMb/d) by 2040, 3% higher than in the HCP  Case.</li>
  <li>The costs of production for conventional and  mined oil sands resources do not decrease significantly in the Technology Case.  Mined oil sands production is the same as no new production is added beyond  those facilities currently under construction in all three cases. Conventional  oil production, including offshore Newfoundland and Labrador production, is lower in the Technology Case as result of lower price assumptions. Figure 4.12  shows in situ oil sands and all other crude oil production in all three cases.</li>

<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows the projected annual average production weighted (PW) improvements in the steam oil ratio (SOR) of thermal oil sands productions, for the Reference, HCP and Technology Cases. In 2015 the PW SOR was 3.03, by 2040 the PW SOR is 2.5, 2.27 and 2.02 under the Reference, HCP and Technology cases, respectively. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Natural gas production is 3% lower in the  Technology Case compared to the HCP Case in 2040. This is primarily because  lower crude oil production results in lower production of solution gas, the  natural gas produced along with oil from oil wells.</li>
  <li>Overall industrial energy use in the Technology  Case is 1% lower than the HCP Case in 2040. Lower oil sands energy use in the  Technology Case is offset by slightly higher energy use in other sectors. This  is largely a result of higher economic growth in some export-oriented  industries and lower energy price assumptions relative to the HCP Case, which  decrease end-use energy prices and increase demand. </li>

<h2 id="s6">Electricity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although total end-use demand is lower in the  Technology Case, a shift towards electricity in buildings and transportation  causes electricity demand in the Technology Case to be 2.7% higher than the HCP  Case in 2040. This, combined with lower renewable costs, increased CCS, and  improved integration of renewable sources leads to a shift in the electricity  mix in the Technology Case.</li>
  <li>By 2040, total capacity in the Technology Case  is 8.8% higher than the HCP Case, and 40% higher than 2015 levels. Due to lower  costs and measures to improve the integration of renewables, solar capacity in  2040 is 16&nbsp;GW higher in the Technology Case relative to HCP Case, and wind  capacity is 4.4 GW higher. In the Technology Case, wind and solar make up 27%  of Canada&rsquo;s capacity mix in 2040, compared to 19% in the Reference and HCP  cases, and 9% in 2015. Figure 4.14 shows total electric capacity by fuel in  2015 and 2040 in all three cases.</li>

<p>This graph shows generating capacity by fuel in 2015 and 2040 for the Reference, HCP, and Technology cases. In 2015 the respective generating capacity for hydro, wind, solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and other fuels was 79.43 GW, 11.07 GW, 2.13 GW, 22.00 GW, 9.66 GW, 14.27 GW and 6.26 GW. In 2040 under the Reference Case the respective generating capacity for hydro, wind, solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and other fuels is 89.25 GW, 26.60 GW, 8.5 GW, 41.72 GW, 1.78 GW, 11.11 GW and 6.78 GW. In 2040 under the HCP Case the respective generating capacity for hydro, wind, solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and other fuels is 89.25 GW, 26.37 GW, 9.36 GW, 41.98 GW, 1.78 GW, 11.11 GW and 6.78 GW. In 2040 under the Technology Case the respective generating capacity for hydro, wind, solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and other fuels is 89.25 GW, 30.79 GW, 28.49 GW, 37.08 GW, 2.64 GW, 11.11 GW and 6.77 GW. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Natural gas capacity does not grow as fast in  the Technology Case, but still increases relative to current levels. In 2040,  natural gas capacity in the Technology Case is nearly 70% higher than in 2015,  as it continues to play an important role in replacing retired coal capacity  and balancing intermittent renewables. Additional CCS capacity in Alberta and  Saskatchewan increases the share of coal-fired capacity compared to the  Reference and HCP cases.</li>
  <li>Electricity generation is 3% higher in the  Technology Case compared to the HCP Case in 2040. This is less than the 8%  increase in capacity because most of the additions are wind and solar. These  resources are variable depending on wind speeds and sun intensity, and over the  course of a year tend to generate less per megawatt of capacity compared to  other sources of electricity. While wind and solar make up 27% of the capacity  mix in 2040, these resources account for 16.5% of generation. Figure 4.15 shows  generation by select fuel in 2015 and 2040 in all cases.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The Technology Case has implications for primary  energy demand because of the shift towards more electricity and reduced overall  demand in the end-use sector, and more renewable generation in the electricity  sector. These changes further reduce Canada&rsquo;s GHG emission trajectory, as less  fossil fuels are combusted and more carbon is captured and sequestered.</li>
  <li>The Technology Case adds renewable and coal  demand due to the shift in the electricity mix. </li>
  <li>Oil product demand declines primarily because of  reduced consumption in the transportation sector. Natural gas demand declines  relative to the HCP Case in the residential, commercial, and industrial end use  sectors, as well as in electric generation.</li>

<p>This graph shows the net difference from 2015 to 2040 in primary energy demand between the HCP and Technology Case, broken down by fuel type. By 2020, oil product demand is 5.04&nbsp;PJ lower in the Technology Case compared to the HCP Case, natural gas demand is 43.7&nbsp;PJ lower in the Technology Case, coal demand is 2.34&nbsp;PJ higher in the Technology Case, and renewables are 4.54&nbsp;PJ higher.

  <li>The impact of these changes causes total primary  demand to decline in the Technology Case, both relative to the Reference and  HCP projections, as well as 2015 values.

<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows the percentage difference in total fossil fuel use from the Reference Case, for the HCP and Technology cases over the projection period. By 2020 the HCP Case is 0.1% lower than the Reference Case, while the Technology Case is 0.5% lower than the Reference Case. By 2030 the HCP Case is 3.8% lower than the Reference Case, while the Technology Case is 6.5% lower than the Reference Case.

<ul>
  <li>The GHG emission intensity of the fossil fuel  mix in the Technology Case is similar to the Reference and HCP cases (Figure  4.18). Natural gas decreases more than other fuels in the Technology Case  relative to the HCP Case, and because natural gas is less emissions-intensive  than other fuels, this will increase the average CO<sub>2</sub>  per megajoule intensity. However, increases in carbon sequestration from CCS  units in the Technology Case offset this effect and lead to lower emissions  intensity. By 2040, emission intensity of the fossil fuel mix in the Technology  Case is just 0.5% less than the HCP Case. </li>

<p>This graph shows the estimated weighted average GHG emission intensity of fossil fuel consumption, for each of the Reference, HCP and Technology cases. In 2005 the emissions intensity was 64.1 grams CO<sub>2</sub>e per megajoule, and in 2015 energy intensity was  59.6 grams CO<sub>2</sub>e per megajoule. By 2040 the emissions intensity is projected to be 54.9 grams CO<sub>2</sub>e per megajoule in the Reference Case, 54.7 grams CO<sub>2</sub>e per megajoule in the HCP Case, and 54.5 grams CO<sub>2</sub>e per megajoule in the Technology Case.</p>

  <li>The analysis in Energy Futures 2017 presents projections of future energy  demand and supply under various assumptions, and is not a pathway to meet  specific climate goals or targets. As in the Reference and HCP cases, accounting for reductions in  non-combustion emissions, such as reducing methane leaks, as well as including  emission credits purchased through international trading mechanisms (such as  Ontario and Quebec&rsquo;s emission trading with California) could further decrease  Canada&rsquo;s emissions trajectory.</li>
  <li> The pace and magnitude of technological change  is a key uncertainty in these projections, and the Technology Case explores  this uncertainty by illustrating the impact of select technologies on the  energy system. Numerous other technologies could be employed to further  decarbonize Canada&rsquo;s energy system. Likewise, the market response to the  increased carbon price in the HCP and Technology cases could be higher or lower  than what is projected.</li>
  <li>The HCP  and Technology cases do not represent a ceiling  on Canada&rsquo;s potential for GHG emission reductions. Rather, the cases illustrate  the impact climate policy and technology can have on Canada&rsquo;s energy system. EF  2017 shows that both factors can bend Canada&rsquo;s fossil fuel use   trajectory in a meaningful way, and will influence the way Canadians produce  and consume energy over the next several decades.</li>

<h2 id="s8"><strong>Key Uncertainties</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Technology Case examines the impact of  higher carbon prices as well as the increased adoption of select technologies  in the long term. The impacts in this case are based on the suite of models and  assumptions employed for this analysis. Other energy models or assumptions  could produce different impacts of carbon pricing and technology trends. </li>
  <li>Numerous other emerging technologies could  affect Canada&rsquo;s energy system in the future. If the technologies explored here  gain a significant market share in the future, the speed at which they are  adopted could be faster or slower than assumed in the Technology Case. Energy  transitions have happened many different ways in history, and the eventual path  of future transitions could be much different than shown here. </li>
  <li>The impact of a global shift to greater climate  policy action and broader adoption of low carbon technologies on global energy  markets is highly uncertain. The HCP and Technology Cases assume that crude oil  prices are lower than the Reference Case, but this impact could be smaller or  larger. Natural gas, coal, and electricity markets could all be affected by  changing global dynamics, as could the supply and demand for energy intensive  goods. These changes will have implications for Canadian macroeconomic, energy  and emission trends.</li>
  <li>The Technology Case shows a higher penetration of  wind and solar electricity generation due to lower cost and improved  integration. Both of these factors are important for the future of solar and  wind in Canada. Costs could fall more or less than assumed in the Technology  Case. Even with lower costs, challenges in integrating these intermittent  resources could limit their uptake. Alternatively, advances in integrating wind  and solar resources could lead to them making up an even higher share of Canada&rsquo;s electricity mix than shown in the Technology Case.</li>

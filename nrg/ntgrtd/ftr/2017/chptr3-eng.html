<h2 id="s2">Macroeconomic Drivers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The economy is a key driver of the energy  system. Economic growth, industrial output, inflation, exchange rates, and  population growth all influence energy supply and demand trends.</li>
  <li>Macroeconomic projections for each of the scenarios were provided by The  Centre for Spatial Economics (C4SE). C4SE developed unique  projections of key macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product,  exchange rate, and industry gross output for each of the scenarios, based on  the price assumptions and output of the NEB&rsquo;s supply and demand models.</li>
  <li>Key economic variables are shown in Table 3.1. Economic  growth averages 1.73% per year over the projection period in the Reference Case.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Compared to the past 25 years, the pace of  economic growth is slower in both the Reference and HCP cases.</li>
  <li>Economic growth in the HCP Case is slightly lower  than in the Reference Case, largely due to somewhat lower global demand for the  fossil fuels and fossil fuel-intensive goods that Canada exports. This includes  crude oil, petrochemicals, and some manufactured products. In addition, higher  prices for fossil fuel energy increases costs for consumers and businesses,  increases inflation and slows economic growth relative to the Reference Case. </li>
  <li>Despite this, the impact on economic growth is small,  with economic activity 0.2% lower in the HCP Case compared to the Reference  Case in 2040. Two key effects offset the negative economic impacts of higher  carbon pricing:
    <ul>
      <li>The  analysis assumes that, in the longer term, revenue from higher carbon pricing  is returned to consumers and business through personal and corporate income tax  reductions. This shift in taxation has positive economic impacts relative to  the Reference Case.</li>
      <li>The  higher price for fossil fuel energy in the HCP Case encourages businesses to rely  less on energy and more on labour and machinery when it is possible to  substitute between production inputs. For example, a manufacturer may choose to  replace their low efficiency boiler sooner than they would have without higher carbon  pricing. This increases investment and enhances productivity, resulting in  greater economic growth in the long term.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h3><strong>Key Uncertainties</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>International demand for Canadian goods, the production  of which can be energy-intensive, will influence export-oriented industries.  Faster or slower economic growth in the United States (U.S.), Canada&rsquo;s largest  trading partner, would affect the economic and energy demand projections. The  impact of greater global climate action on demand for GHG-intensive goods is  highly uncertain and could impact growth of heavy industry in Canada. </li>
  <li>Large projects in the mining, oil, natural gas,  and electricity sectors affect the macroeconomic projections in a number of  provinces. The pace of these developments is uncertain and could lead to higher  or lower economic growth.</li>
  <li>As noted in Chapter 2, a price on carbon can be  a driver of innovation and investment in technologies that would reduce GHG  emissions. It is difficult to predict the innovations and accompanying economic  activity that may develop due to a greater economic incentive to reduce GHG  emissions. </li>

<h2 id="s3">Energy Demand</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This section focuses mainly on end-use, or <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#secondaryenergyuse">secondary  energy demand</a>. Secondary demand excludes energy used to generate  electricity, which is accounted for in <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#primaryenergydemand">primary  demand</a>.  </li>
  <li>Figure&nbsp;3.1 shows annual average growth  rates of energy use by sector over the past 25 years and from 2016 to 2040 in  the Reference and HCP cases. Compared to the 1990-2015 period, when demand grew  by an average of 1.2% per year, end-use energy demand in the Reference Case  grows considerably more slowly over the outlook period, averaging growth of 0.3%  per year.</li>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph displays historical and projected average annual growth in end-use energy demand across the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors as well as total end-use demand for the Reference Case and the HCP Case. Average annual end-use energy demand growth in the residential sector was 0.4% from 1990-2015. In the Reference Case residential end use demand is projected to be 0.4%, and in the HCP Case it is 0.2% from 2016-2040. Average annual end-use energy demand growth in the commercial sector was 1.4% from 1990-2015. In the Reference Case it is projected to be 0.8% and in the HCP Case it is 0.5% from 2016-2040. Average annual end-use energy demand growth in the Industrial sector was 1.4% from 1990-2015. In the Reference Case it is projected to be 0.5% and in the HCP Case it is 0.1% from 2016-2040. Average annual end-use energy demand growth in the transportation sector was 1.3% from 1990-2015. In the Reference Case it is projected to be -0.5% and in the HCP Case it is -0.6% from 2016-2040. Average annual end-use energy demand growth for total end-use was 1.2% from 1990-2015. In the Reference Case it is projected to be 0.3% and in the HCP Case it is 0.0% from 2016-2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike previous Energy Futures  Reference Case outlooks, end-use demand eventually begins to decline near the  end of the projection period. Total end-use energy demand peaks in 2037 at nearly <br>
    12&nbsp;155&nbsp;petajoules (PJ). Energy consumption slowly declines for the remainder of  the projection period. </li>
  <li>There are many reasons why energy use grows more  slowly than history, and eventually starts to decline near the end of the  projection period. Some key factors include:
    <ul>
      <li>Economic  and population growth influence energy use and, as shown in Table 3.1, both  grow at slower rates in the projection period compared to history. Canada also  has a long trend of declining energy use per dollar of economic activity, which  is typical of developed countries. This trend continues in the projection  period.</li>
      <li>Energy  efficiency has improved in many areas in the past, and continues to improve in  the projection period. This reduces energy demand growth because less energy is  required for new devices and equipment. For example, since 1990, <a href="https://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/showTable.cfm?type=CP&sector=res&juris=ca&rn=27&page=0" rel="external">lower  efficiency natural gas furnaces have nearly been entirely replaced</a> by  medium and high efficiency units that are 30% to 50% more efficient. In recent  years, the stock of medium efficiency furnaces has declined, while high  efficiency units continue to grow.</li>
      <li>Although  oil and natural gas prices are currently lower than their recent peaks, Figures  2.2 and 2.3 show that both prices are assumed to increase from current levels  over the projection period. This will further slow demand growth.  </li>
      <li>The  pan-Canadian approach for pricing carbon pollution is included in the Reference  Case. An economy-wide carbon price will have a downward impact on energy use  trends. <a href="https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/ni_wp_15-04_full.pdf" rel="external">A  recent review of a variety of studies on B.C.&rsquo;s carbon price</a> finds that the  policy reduced demand and GHG emissions between 5 and 15% compared to what  would have occurred without carbon pricing. </li>
      <li>Several  other policies, programs and regulations affect energy use in the projection  period. For example, light and heavy duty vehicle emission standards will  improve the efficiency of new vehicles in both the passenger and freight  sectors over the projection period.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compared to the Reference Case, total end-use  demand growth is lower in the HCP Case. Demand grows until peaking in 2022,  more than a decade earlier than in the Reference Case. After 2022, demand  declines at an average annual rate of 0.3%, and is nearly 800&nbsp;PJ lower than the  Reference Case by 2040.  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Residential and Commercial</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Residential  energy use is the energy consumed by Canadian households. This includes energy  used for space and water heating, air conditioning, lighting, large appliances,  and other devices like televisions and computers. The residential sector made  up 14% of total end-use demand in 2015.</li>
  <li>In the Reference Case, energy use in the  residential sector increases from 1&nbsp;570&nbsp;PJ in 2016 to 1&nbsp;717&nbsp;PJ in  2040, or 9%. Population growth, a key driver in residential energy use, grows  by 20% over that period, implying that residential energy use per person  declines. This continues the <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/pdf/trends2013.pdf" rel="external">historical  trend of energy use per household declining</a>, and is influenced by many  factors including energy prices and energy efficiency improvements.</li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, energy use grows slightly  slower and in 2040 total energy use is 50&nbsp;PJ less than in the Reference Case. Figure  3.2 shows energy use by fuel in the Reference and HCP cases.</li>

<img src="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/mg/fg03-2-eng.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 - Residential Energy Demand by Major Fuel, Reference and HCP Cases" class="center-block img-responsive">
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows the projected change in residential energy demand by major fuel in the Reference and HCP Cases from 2015 to 2040. The fuel sources included in the graph are natural gas, electricity, heating oil and biomass. Annual natural gas use increases from 690&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case to 782&nbsp;PJ in 2040, and to 733&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case. Annual electricity use increases from 608&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case to 672&nbsp;PJ, and 670&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case. Biomass use increases from 188&nbsp;PJ to 196&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and 198&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case. Heating oil decreases from 67&nbsp;PJ to 43&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and 41&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>In the HCP Case, residential natural gas demand in  2040 is 6% lower than in the Reference Case as consumers invest in more  efficient natural gas furnaces and water heaters and other energy saving  measures. Higher carbon pricing also makes lower emission fuels more attractive,  resulting in similar electricity and biomass consumption in the HCP Case.  Biomass is used most frequently in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, where wood and  wood pellet consumption makes up over 20% of residential energy use.</li>
  <li>The commercial sector is a broad category that  includes offices, stores, warehouses, government and institutional buildings,  utilities, communications, and other service industries. It also includes  energy consumed by street lighting and pipelines.  The commercial sector  made up 12% of total end-use demand in 2015.</li>
  <li>In the Reference Case, commercial demand  increases by 0.8% per year over the projection period, slower than the 1.4%  growth over the past 25 years. In the HCP Case, demand grows by 0.5% per year  and is 6%, or 93&nbsp;PJ, lower than in the Reference Case by 2040. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/pdf/trends2013.pdf" rel="external">Energy  use per square foot for buildings in the commercial sector has decreased by 15%  from 1990</a>, despite increased energy use by equipment such as computers in  buildings. Continued efficiency improvements, and fewer additions of new  equipment, contribute to the slower demand growth in the projection period.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Industrial</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The industrial sector includes manufacturing,  forestry, fisheries, agriculture, construction, mining, and oil and natural gas  extraction. The industrial sector made up slightly more than half the end-use  demand in 2015. </li>
  <li>The industrial energy demand projections are  largely driven by the economic growth projections of various industries. In  many cases, industrial growth is linked to demand for goods consumed domestically  but also those exported internationally due to Canada&rsquo;s trade-oriented economy. </li>
  <li>In the Reference Case, industrial demand grows steadily  in the first decade of the projection period largely due to growth in the oil  sands. Industrial demand increases from 5&nbsp;739&nbsp;PJ in 2016 to 6&nbsp;495&nbsp;PJ in 2026, a  13% increase. After 2023, industrial demand stays relatively constant, a result  of steady efficiency improvements and slowing output growth in industries such  as paper and metal manufacturing.</li>
  <li>Figure 3.3 shows energy use trends by various  industrial sectors in the Reference Case. The oil sands sector grows over the  projection period, driven largely by increasing in situ bitumen production.  Natural gas is the primary fuel for in situ production, and demand in that  sector increases from 610&nbsp;PJ in 2016 to 1&nbsp;025&nbsp;PJ in 2040, a 68% increase. While  total demand increases, the energy intensity of in situ production continues to  decline throughout the projection period. </li>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows the changes in industrial energy demand by the manufacturing, conventional oil and gas, oil sands production, and other categories, from 2016 to 2040. Annual manufacturing energy demand is projected to increase from 2 978&nbsp;PJ in 2016 and peak at 3 163&nbsp;PJ in 2024. After that it steadily decreases to 3 121&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Conventional oil and gas energy demand is projected to decrease from 903&nbsp;PJ in 2016 to 805&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Oil sands production and refining demand is projected to increase from 1 216&nbsp;PJ in 2016 to 1 873&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Other areas of industrial energy demand are projected to increase from 660&nbsp;PJ to 703&nbsp;PJ in 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Industrial energy demand in the HCP Case is 9%,  or 595&nbsp;PJ, lower than in the Reference Case by 2040. This lower demand is  largely due to two factors:
    <ul>
      <li>As  in other sectors, higher carbon pricing encourages greater investments in more energy  efficient devices and processes than in the Reference Case.</li>
      <li>As described in the Macroeconomic Drivers  section of this chapter, the HCP Case assumes that global demand for more  carbon-intensive products, including crude oil, is somewhat lower. This  translates into slightly lower production from these industries, resulting in  less energy use.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The transportation sector includes passenger and  freight on-road transportation, as well as air, rail, marine, and  non-industrial off-road travel, such as recreational all-terrain vehicles and  snowmobiles. The  transportation sector made up 23% of total end-use demand in 2015.</li>
  <li>After increasing steadily for the past 25 years,  total transportation demand declines slowly over the projection period,  averaging a 0.5% decrease per year from 2016 to 2040. On-road passenger  transportation, which was 42% of total transportation demand in 2015, falls  steadily, while freight transportation increases slightly over the projection  period.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Passenger Transportation  </h4>
<ul>
  <li>On-road passenger transportation energy use has  been relatively constant in Canada; consumption in 2015 was close to 2002 levels.  Early in the projection period, consumption begins to decline, falling to 720&nbsp;PJ in 2040, a third less than in 2016. This is driven by several factors: 
    <ul>
      <li>Alongside  the U.S., <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/greenhouse-gas-emissions-performance-2011-2015.html" rel="external">Canada  enacted GHG emission standards that extend from 2012 to 2025</a>. The standards  target GHG emissions per kilometer (km) driven. The average emissions of new passenger  vehicles bought in Canada fell from 158 grams CO<sub>2</sub>e  per km in 2011 to 142 grams for those sold in 2015. This decrease is, in part, due  to fuel economy improvements resulting from greater use of technologies such  turbochargers, cylinder deactivation, and continuous variable  transmissions.   </li>
      <li>The  Reference Case assumes modest adoption of EVs over the projection period. The  displacement of some traditional passenger automobiles with EVs contributes to  lower energy consumption. The Technology Case, discussed in Chapter 4, provides  an analysis of greater EV adoption.  </li>
      <li>Canada&rsquo;s  population grows more slowly in the projection period than in the past,  resulting in less transportation demand growth. Canada&rsquo;s population grew by 1.0%  per year from 1990 to 2015, compared to 0.8% from 2016 to 2040 in the Reference  Case.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Total Canadian gasoline demand in all sectors falls  to 1 090&nbsp;PJ in 2040 In the Reference Case, 26% lower than when gasoline  consumption peaked in 2007. Figure 3.4 shows gasoline consumption in the  Reference and HCP cases.</li>
</ul>

<img src="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/mg/fg03-4-eng.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 - Gasoline Demand, Reference and HCP Cases" class="center-block img-responsive">
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows annual gasoline demand in both the Reference and HCP cases from 2005 to 2040. Demand was 1 418&nbsp;PJ in 2005, growing to 1 437&nbsp;PJ in 2015. After that both cases show a decrease through the end of the projection period. In the Reference Case demand falls to 1 090&nbsp;PJ and 1 054&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case by 2040. </p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>In the HCP Case, gasoline demand declines more  quickly, and is 3% lower than in the Reference Case by 2040. Higher carbon  pricing translates to higher gasoline prices, encouraging purchases of more  fuel efficient vehicles and less driving in general. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Freight Transportation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Freight transportation energy use, which  includes demand from medium and heavy trucks, air, railways and marine vessels,  made up 44% of total transportation demand in 2015. Freight demand is linked to  growth in goods-producing industries and increased steadily at an annual  average rate of 2.4% from 1990 to 2015, nearly doubling over that period.</li>
  <li>Compared to the past 25 years, freight energy  use grows much slower, averaging 0.7% per year from 2016 to 2040. Similar to  passenger transportation, policies like the GHG emission standards for medium  and heavy duty vehicles result in slower energy demand growth than in previous  years. Economic growth, a key driver of freight activity, is also somewhat  slower than in the past. In particular, freight energy demand growth in Alberta  and Saskatchewan slows following several years of rapid growth. This is similar  to the experience in Ontario and Quebec, where growth slowed following rapid  growth in the 1990s and early 2000s. Total freight energy use peaks in 2022 at  1&nbsp;210&nbsp;PJ.</li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, freight energy use is 5% lower  than in the Reference Case by 2040.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Electric Vehicles (EVs)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Gasoline and diesel are the primary fuels in the  transportation sector. However, <a href="https://www.rethinkx.com/fullsummary" rel="external">some  market observers</a> suggest that a transformation of the transportation sector  may be underway, with EVs poised to quickly replace traditional passenger vehicles.  It is always difficult to predict whether the momentum behind a new phenomenon,  such as the recent surge of interest in EVs, will translate into a  transformational change.</li>
  <li>The Reference and HCP cases take a conservative  approach to new technology and assume modest adoption of EVs. However, incentives  for purchases in some provinces, as well as an EV mandate in Quebec, contribute  to a steadily increasing market share for EVs in both cases.</li>
  <li>Figure 3.5 shows the proportion of new passenger  vehicle purchases that are EVs as well as total electricity demand in the  transportation sector. The Reference Case assumes EV sales are highest in  Quebec due to its EV mandate policy, purchase incentives, and low electricity  prices. Ontario, B.C. and Manitoba also have higher EV sales due to their low-emitting  electricity grids and vehicle purchase incentives. Sales increase steadily from  2016 to 2025 as a result of various programs to support EV purchases. After  2025, the share of new sales increases more gradually as those programs are  phased out. In 2040, total Canadian electricity demand from EVs is 34&nbsp;PJ, less  than 1.5% of total electricity consumption in Canada.</li>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows the EV share of new vehicle purchases and the total transportation electricity demanded in the Reference Case from 2016 to 2040. Projected EV share is presented for Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, B.C., and Other Provinces. EV share of sales in Quebec rapidly increases from 1.08% in 2016 to 22% in 2025 then levels off and slowly increases to 26.5% in 2040. EV share of sales in Ontario, Manitoba, B.C. rapidly increases from 0.42% in 2016 to 10% in 2025 then levels off and increases to 16.67% in 2040. EV share of sales in the other provinces increases from 0.11% in 2016 to 4% in 2025 then levels off and slowly increases to 6.67% in 2040. Total Canadian transportation electricity demanded increases from 4.57&nbsp;PJ per year in 2016 to 33.85&nbsp;PJ in 2040.</p>
</details>
<h3>Primary Demand</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In this analysis, primary demand is the total  amount of energy used in Canada. In addition to end-use demand, it includes the  energy required to generate electricity.</li>
  <li>Primary demand is calculated by adding the energy  used to generate electricity to total end-use <br>
    (or secondary) demand, and then subtracting the end-use demand for electricity. </li>
  <li>In the Reference Case, primary energy demand  increases at an average annual rate of 0.2% over the projection period,  reaching 14&nbsp;170&nbsp;PJ in 2040—an increase of 854&nbsp;PJ. Primary demand grows slowly  until 2036, at which point it begins to decline. As shown in Figure 3.6, the  share of natural gas increases the most, driven by power generation and the oil  sands. Coal&rsquo;s share of primary demand falls considerably due to declining  coal-fired power generation. <strong></strong></li>
</ul>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This chart shows primary energy demand of several different energy sources in 2016 compared to the 2040 Reference and HCP cases. Natural gas demand is 4 634&nbsp;PJ in 2016, which increases to 5 728&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and  to 5 066&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case by 2040. RPP and NGL demand is 4 675&nbsp;PJ in 2016, which increases to 4 510&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and decreases to 4 358&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case by 2040. Coal, coke and coke oven gas demand is 690&nbsp;PJ in 2016, which decreases to 191&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and decreases to 175&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case by 2040. Hydro demand is 1 336&nbsp;PJ in 2016, which increases to 1 486&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and increases to 1 482&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case by 2040. Nuclear demand is 11 77&nbsp;PJ in 2016, which decreases to 1 066&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and decreases to 1 066&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case by 2040. Other renewables and landfill gas demand is 1 031&nbsp;PJ in 2016, which increases to 1 188&nbsp;PJ in the Reference Case, and increases to 1 193&nbsp;PJ in the HCP Case, by 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Primary energy demand peaks earlier in the HCP  Case, reaching 14&nbsp;049&nbsp;PJ in 2019 before declining throughout the remainder of  the projection period. Demand for most fuels is lower relative to the Reference  Case. Natural gas demand in 2040 is 12% lower compared to the Reference Case while  consumption of RPPs and natural gas liquids (NGLs) is 3% lower.</li>
  <li>Energy intensity, measured as energy use per  unit of economic activity, declines steadily in both the Reference and HCP cases.  Energy intensity declines at an average 1.5% per year in the Reference Case and  1.8% in the HCP Case. Energy use per dollar of gross domestic product falls  from 7.5 megajoules (MJ) per dollar in 2016 to 5.2&nbsp;MJ/$ in 2040 in the  Reference Case and 4.9&nbsp;MJ/$ in the HCP Case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>EF2017 assumes modest growth of emerging  technologies. However, technology&rsquo;s influence on the energy system can be  substantial and often difficult to predict. Chapter 4 explores this uncertainty  by analyzing the impact of greater uptake of a selection of emerging  technologies on the energy system.<strong></strong></li>
  <li>The HCP Case examines the impact of higher  carbon prices in the long term. The energy use impact in this case is based on  the energy demand forecasting model and assumptions employed for this analysis.  Other energy models or assumptions could produce different impacts of carbon  pricing. <strong></strong></li>
  <li>The HCP Case examines one element of future  climate policy uncertainty: carbon pricing. Policies, programs, and regulations are continually under development at  federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal levels. These may have  significant implications for energy demand trends. The suite of climate  policies that will be in place in the long term is unknown. <strong></strong></li>

<h2 id="s4">Crude Oil</h2>
<ul>
  <li>By 2040 Canadian crude oil production in the  Reference Case is 1&nbsp;000 thousand cubic metres per day (10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d) or 6.3 million  barrels per day (MMb/d). This is 59% higher than 2016 levels of 631&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (4.0 MMb/d).  Figure 3.7 shows crude oil production by type in the Reference Case and total  production in the HCP Case.</li>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph breaks down the growth in Canadian crude oil and equivalent production in the Reference and HCP cases from 2005 to 2040. Eastern Canadian production changes from 51 MMb/d in 2005 to 16 MMb/d in 2040 in the Reference Case. WCSB conventional light production changes from 79 MMb/d in 2005 to 93 MMb/d in 2040 in the Reference Case. WCSB conventional heavy production changes from 89 MMb/d in 2005 to 118 MMb/d in 2040 in the Reference Case. WCSB condensate production changes from 24 MMb/d in 2005 to 55 MMb/d in 2040 in the Reference Case. Mined bitumen production changes from 100 MMb/d in 2005 to 265 MMb/d in 2040 in the Reference Case. In situ bitumen production changes from 70 MMb/d in 2005 to 453 MMb/d in 2040 in the Reference Case. Total production in the Reference Case changes from 412 MMb/d in 2005 to 1000 MMb/d in 2040. In the HCP Case total production changes from 412 MMb/d in 2005 to 908 MMb/d in 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Total oil production in the HCP Case reaches 908&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (5.7&nbsp;MMb/d) by 2040, 9% lower than in the Reference Case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Oil Sands</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Oil sands production in 2016 was 405&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (2.5 MMb/d). At  nearly two-thirds of total Canadian oil production in 2016, oil sands make up  most of the production growth over the projection period. As shown in Figure 3.8,  oil sands production in the Reference Case increases by 77% from 2016 to 2040,  reaching 718&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d  (4.5 MMb/d). The Reference and HCP Cases assume no major use of solvent-based  technologies, which involves injecting propane or butane into in situ  reservoirs to improve bitumen recovery and reduce energy use. The impact of  greater use of this technology is explored in the Technology Case, discussed in  Chapter 4.</li>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows the forecasted changes in oil sands production in the Reference and HCP cases from 2005 to 2040. In situ production increases from 70&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2005 to 453&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2040 in the Reference case, while it increases to 402&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in the HCP Case.  Mined production in both the Reference and HCP cases increases from 100&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2005 to 265&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2024 then levels off and remains constant until the end of the forecast in 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>In the Reference and HCP cases, production of <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#miningextractionandupgradingplant">mined</a> and <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#insiturecovery">in situ</a> bitumen grows steadily early in the projection period. This growth is from recently completed oil sands projects that  are ramping up production and those currently under construction. From 2018 to  2021, annual oil sands production growth averages 19&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (122&nbsp;Mb/d) per  year, slightly slower than growth in the past decade but quicker than the 2022  to 2040 period in both the Reference and HCP cases.</li>
  <li>After mining projects currently under  construction are completed and their production is brought up to capacity, no additional  mining capacity is added over the projection period. In both cases, crude oil  prices do not reach high enough levels to encourage new investment. After 2024,  mined bitumen production in the Reference and HCP cases stay constant at 265&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.7 MMb/d).</li>
  <li>In the Reference Case, in situ bitumen  production more than doubles from 2016 to 2040, reaching 453&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (2.9&nbsp;MMb/d) in 2040, up from 222&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.4&nbsp;MMb/d) in 2016. The crude oil price assumptions in the Reference Case encourage sufficient  investment to grow production, particularly by experienced producers with high  quality deposits. </li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, in situ production continues to  grow but more slowly than in the Reference Case. This is driven by:
    <ul>
      <li> The assumption of lower global crude oil prices  in the HCP Case.</li>
      <li> Higher carbon prices than in the Reference  Case.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The crude oil prices in the two cases slowly  diverge starting in 2023 and by 2040 the Brent crude oil price is US$5/bbl  lower in the HCP Case. This lower price reduces the incentive to invest in more  costly projects and is a driver of lower in situ production in the HCP Case. </li>
  <li>In both cases, the carbon pricing scheme for  industrial emissions described in the <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/climate-leadership-discussion.aspx" rel="external">Alberta Climate  Leadership Panel&rsquo;s report</a> is applied to the  oil sands sector. A key element of this scheme is sector-specific output-based  allocations that aim to mitigate the competitiveness and employment impacts of  applying carbon pricing to trade-exposed industries. </li>
  <li>For oil sands producers the structure of the industrial  carbon pricing scheme means that, in a given year, each producer receives the  same allocation of free emission permits per barrel of output. However, each  producer&rsquo;s net per barrel carbon costs will vary based on how GHG-intensive  they are compared to other producers. </li>
  <li>A common metric of the energy intensity of in  situ oil sands projects is their <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#steamoilratio">steam to  oil ratio</a> (SOR). Figure 3.9 shows the estimated per barrel carbon cost of  in situ oil sands projects with different SORs. The figure shows the carbon  costs associated with natural gas consumption for oil sands projects in the  year 2022, when the carbon price is $50/tonne in both Reference and HCP cases. Most  in situ oil sands projects have SORs ranging from 2 to 3 barrels of steam per  barrel of oil produced.</li>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph compares the estimated per barrel in situ oil sands carbon costs at $50/tonne in 2022 between a standard carbon cost per barrel and carbon cost per barrel including output-based allocation. At an SOR of 1.5 the carbon cost per barrel is 1.62 $/barrel and slopes steadily upwards to 5.4 $/barrel with an SOR of 5.  At an SOR of 1.5 the carbon cost per barrel including output-based allocation is -0.82 $/barrel and slopes steadily upwards to 2.96 $/barrel with an SOR of 5.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>As shown in Figure 3.9, the per barrel cost  increases as the SORs of in situ projects increase. It also shows the impact of  the output-based allocations, which reduce the average per barrel carbon cost for  all producers by roughly $2.40 per barrel. Producers performing better than the  25<sup>th</sup> percentile receive allocations in excess of  their carbon costs, resulting in a net credit for producers with SORs lower  than 2.3. </li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, the carbon price, and hence the  carbon cost per barrel, continues to increase over the projection period. The HCP  Case assumes greater global climate action. Accordingly, mechanisms addressing  competitiveness concerns, like output-based allocations, are less necessary. The  size of the output-based allocations is gradually reduced over the projection  period in the HCP Case.</li>
  <li>Together, higher carbon costs and lower crude  oil prices in the HCP Case cause in situ production to grow slower, reaching 402&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (2.5&nbsp;MMb/d) in 2040, or 11% lower than in the Reference Case. Some more costly and  emission-intensive projects that are included in the Reference Case are excluded  from the HCP Case. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Western Canadian Conventional  Crude Oil</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Total conventional crude oil production from western  Canada accounted for nearly 30% of total Canadian production in 2016 at 192&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.2 MMb/d). Conventional  production is classified as <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#lightcrudeoil">light</a> or <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#heavycrudeoil">heavy</a> depending on the <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#apigravity">API gravity</a> of the oil. In 2016, 43% of western Canadian conventional production was heavy  and 57% was light (including <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#condensate">condensate</a> production). Over 90% of conventional production came from Alberta and  Saskatchewan in 2016, with smaller amounts from Manitoba, B.C., and Northwest  Territories (NWT). Figure 3.10 shows total conventional production over the  projection period in Saskatchewan and Alberta.</li>

Saskatchewan heavy production was 57&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2005. This is followed by a generally steady increase until it reaches 105&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>In Saskatchewan, heavy oil production increases  by over 60% from 2016 levels, increasing from <br>
    64&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (404&nbsp;Mb/d) to 105&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d  (658&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2040 in the Reference Case. Heavy oil production in Alberta  declines early in the projection period and then grows moderately to 2040. </li>
  <li>Heavy oil production growth in Saskatchewan is a  result of the application of <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#steamassistedgravitydrainage">steam  assisted gravity drainage recovery</a> (SAGD) methods — a technology often deployed  in the oil sands — to heavy oil fields. By early 2017, 15 thermal heavy oil  projects were operating in Saskatchewan, a nearly 3-fold increase from 2012.  Similar to the oil sands, production from these thermal projects does not  exhibit the steep decline rates typical of traditional heavy oil wells. This  contributes to the attractiveness of this type of production, leading to steady  growth over the projection period. </li>
  <li>Production of light conventional oil declines in  the first 4 years of the projection period in the Reference Case as oil prices  are insufficient to encourage enough new drilling to offset declines from  existing wells. After 2020, production begins to increase as higher prices  encourage greater investment. By 2040, light conventional oil production, which  includes <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#tightoil">tight  oil</a>, is 28% higher than in 2016, reaching 93&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (584&nbsp;Mb/d).</li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, higher carbon costs and lower  crude oil prices result in conventional production growing slower, as shown in  Figure 3.11. Total conventional production in western Canada reaches 181&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.1 MMb/d) in  2040, or 13% lower than in the Reference Case. </li>

<h3>Newfoundland Offshore</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the Reference Case, Newfoundland and Labrador offshore oil production increases steadily over the next five years as the Hebron project begins production and additional wells are brought online at existing facilities. After peaking at 49&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (309&nbsp;Mb/d) by 2023, production begins to decline as shown in Figure 3.12. The Reference Case assumes two generic offshore discoveries add new production starting in 2027 and 2033. As a result of lower oil price assumptions, the HCP Case assumes only one new discovery, which adds production starting in 2030.</li>

</details>
<h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Future oil prices are a key driver of future  Canadian oil production and a key uncertainty to the projections in EF2017.  Crude oil prices could be higher or lower depending on demand trends,  technological developments, geopolitical events, and the pace at which nations  enact policies to reduce GHG emissions. The previous edition of Energy Futures, <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016updt/index-eng.html">Canada&rsquo;s  Energy Future 2016: Update</a>, provides additional sensitivity cases that explore  the impact of higher or lower oil prices.</li>
  <li>The HCP Case assumes that global crude oil  prices are lower compared to the Reference Case. This price impact is uncertain  and depends on the robustness of concerted global climate action, the  responsiveness of oil demand to higher carbon costs, and the availability of  alternatives to existing technologies. </li>
  <li>The pace of technological developments in the  oil sands is a key uncertainty. EF2017 assumes gradual technological  improvement in the sector and more or less rapid technology development could impact  the oil sands production projections. Potential advances that could change the  supply projections include solvent-based processes, electrification, and CCS  technology.</li>
  <li>The application of SAGD recovery techniques to  Saskatchewan&rsquo;s heavy oil resources is a recent trend and future production  growth is uncertain.</li>
  <li>This  analysis assumes that over the long term, all energy production will find  markets and infrastructure will be built as needed. However, projects to  increase oil transportation capacity in North America have proven  controversial. Whether sufficient pipeline infrastructure is in place will  impact pricing of Canadian crude oil and the economics of production. Chapter  10 of <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016/index-eng.html">Canada&rsquo;s  Energy Future 2016</a> provides additional analysis on this key uncertainty to  the Canadian energy outlook.</li>

<h2 id="s5">Natural Gas</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Natural gas production in the Reference Case declines  early in the projection period, reaching a low of 414 million cubic metres per  day (10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d) or 14.6  billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2023. After 2023, production begins to  increase as gradually higher prices encourage enough drilling to offset  production declines from older wells. By 2040, production increases to 477&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (16.8&nbsp;Bcf/d), its highest level since  2007. Figure 3.13 shows natural gas production in Alberta, B.C., and the  rest of Canada in the Reference and HCP cases. </li>

<p>This graph shows both Reference and HCP Case projections for Canadian natural gas production. In the Reference Case, B.C.'s production increases from 125.3&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 155.2&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040, Alberta's production increases from 286.2&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 309.4&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040, while production in the rest of Canada decreases from 17&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 12.2&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. In the HCP Case, B.C.'s production increases from 125.3&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 141.8&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040, Alberta's production decreases from 286.2&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 277.6&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040, while production in the rest of Canada decreases from 17&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 11.6&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figure 3.14 shows tight and shale gas production  by play in the Reference Case. Production from the Montney formation, a large resource located in northeast B.C. that extends  into northwest Alberta, has grown significantly over the past five years.  Production of <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#tightgas">tight  gas</a> from the Montney increased from no production prior to 2006 to almost 128&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (4.5&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2016, or 30% of total Canadian  natural gas production in 2016. The majority of production growth over the  projection period comes from the Montney, with production reaching 223&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (7.9&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040, a 74% increase from 2016. In  the HCP Case, production from the Montney grows at a slightly slower pace and is 8% lower than the Reference Case by 2040.</li>

<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph breaks down the Reference Case projection for Canadian tight and shale natural gas production by their play. B.C.'s portion of the Montney play is projected to increase production from 92.84&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016, to 146.89&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040, while Alberta's portion is projected to increase from 35.47&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 75.79&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. Alberta's Deep Basin is projected to increase from 95.95&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 109.95&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. Duvernay Shale is projected to increase from 5.69&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 23.84&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. Horn River Shale is projected to decreases from 7.91&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 4.26&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. Other Shale and Tight gas is projected to decreases from 28.47&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 4.99&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. </p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>The Alberta Deep Basin – a liquids rich tight  gas play which runs along the Alberta foothills – produced 96&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (3.4&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2016. Production grows modestly as  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices increase, reaching 110&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (3.8&amp;nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2040 in the Reference Case and 105&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (3.7 Bcf/d) in the HCP Case.</li>
  <li>The Duvernay and Horn River shale gas plays  currently produce small amounts of natural gas and production from both grows  modestly over the projection period. The Duvernay is an emerging shale play in  Alberta that contains natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil. The Horn  River play lacks natural gas liquids, reducing its attractiveness compared to  other areas. Combined, production from the two plays increases from 14&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (0.5 Bcf/d) in 2016 to 28&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.0 Bcf/d) in  the Reference Case by 2040.</li>
  <li>Production from <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#Conventionalnaturalgas">conventional</a> and <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#coalbedmethane">coalbed  methane</a> natural gas resources – which do not rely on horizontal drilling  and <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#multistagehydraulicfracturing">multi-stage  hydraulic fracturing</a> techniques – declines steadily over the projection period  as new drilling targeting these resources is not economic given the natural gas  price assumptions in EF2017. Western Canadian <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#conventionalnaturalgas">conventional  non-tight production</a>, which made up 65% of total production in 2006 and 37%  in 2016, falls to 23% in 2040.</li>
  <li>Natural gas production in eastern Canada  continues to decline over the projection period. Onshore natural gas production  in New Brunswick falls to near zero in both the Reference and HCP Case by 2040.  Offshore natural gas production in Nova Scotia declines steadily over the  projection period. Production ceases in 2021 when the costs of offshore  operations exceed the revenue generated by the natural gas produced. </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous  Energy Futures Reference Case projections have  assumed some volumes of LNG exports within the projection period. The global  LNG market is becoming increasingly competitive as more facilities are built  around the world. <a href="/nrg/sttstc/ntrlgs/rprt/2017lngmrkt/index-eng.html">Some  LNG projects are still being considered by developers on Canada&rsquo;s east and west  coasts</a>. However, given recent low global LNG prices and the relatively  higher cost of commissioning a new LNG facility along with pipelines needed to  supply gas to it, EF2017 makes an assumption that no LNG exports from Canada  will take place over the projection period.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Future natural gas prices are a key uncertainty in the projections. The previous edition of Energy Futures, <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016updt/index-eng.html">Canada&rsquo;s  Energy Future 2016: Update</a>, provides additional sensitivity cases that  explore the impact of higher or lower natural gas prices. </li>
  <li>This analysis assumes that over the long term, all energy production will  find markets and infrastructure will be built as needed. However, lack of  markets for Canadian natural gas production could reduce the prices Canadian  producers receive relative to the Henry Hub price and impact gas production  trends. </li>
  <li>The timing and  volume of LNG exports from Canada is uncertain. Canadian LNG exports have  several advantages over competitors such as its proximity to Asian markets, the  low cost of natural gas feedstocks, and the benefits of cooler Canadian  weather. It is possible that market conditions and the costs of commissioning a  new LNG export facility may change in the future, influencing the future  prospects of LNG in Canada. Uncertainty related to LNG exports is explored further in two  sensitivity cases in Chapter 11 of <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016/index-eng.html">Canada&rsquo;s  Energy Future 2016</a>.</li>
  <li>The  HCP Case assumes the same natural gas prices as in the Reference Case. As noted  in Chapter 2, this is based on uncertainty related to the impact that stronger  global action on climate could have on North American and global natural gas  demand, and hence natural gas prices. Stronger carbon action may affect fuel  choices, the competitiveness of renewables in the power generation sector, and the  pace of technological developments. &nbsp;</li>

<h2 id="s6">Natural Gas Liquids</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Raw natural gas recovered at a wellhead is  comprised primarily of methane, but often contains other hydrocarbons and some  contaminants. These other hydrocarbons consist of ethane, propane, butanes and  pentanes plus, which are collectively referred to as <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#naturalgasliquids">NGLs</a>. The majority of NGLs are  recovered from natural gas but some are also produced as a by-product of oil  refining or bitumen upgrading.</li>
  <li>Total natural gas liquid production increases steadily throughout the projections, as natural gas producers increasingly target areas rich with NGLs. Combined NGL production increases by 30% over the projection period, from 142&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (0.9 MMb/d) in 2016 to 185&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.2MMb/d) in 2040.

<p>This graph breaks down Canadian natural gas liquids production in the Reference Case projection.  Ethane production decreases from 39.9&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 38.5&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. Propane production increases from 37.8&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 43.5&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. Production of butanes increases from 18.5&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016 to 21.2&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040. Pentanes Plus production increases from 39.0&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d in 2016, to 69.9&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d by 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul><li>
  Ethane, the majority of which is extracted at <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#straddleplant">large natural gas processing facilities</a> located on major natural gas pipelines in Alberta and B.C., made up 30% of NGL  production in 2016 at 43&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (270&nbsp;Mb/d). Ethane production in the Reference  Case is relatively stable at 41&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (261&nbsp;Mb/d) over the projection period as its  production is limited to the capacity of petrochemical facilities in Alberta  which use it as a feedstock.
  </li>
  <li>Propane production in the Reference Case  declines until the end of the decade, following overall natural gas production  trends. As natural gas production begins to increase, propane production begins  to increase steadily, and reaches 43&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (273&nbsp;Mb/d) by 2040, 15% higher than 2016 levels of  38&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (133&nbsp;Mb/d).</li>
  <li>Butanes production follows a similar pattern to propane  production, declining early and then increasing steadily through the remainder  of the projection period. Butane production is 13% higher than 2016 levels by  2040, increasing from 23&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (142&nbsp;Mb/d) to 25&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (160&nbsp;Mb/d).
  </li>
  <li>Production of pentanes plus, also referred to as  condensate, increased over 50% from 2013 to 2016, as producers targeted  pentanes plus rich areas, such as the Montney and Duvernay plays. Of the NGLs,  pentanes plus increases the most over the projection period, increasing by 91%,  from 39&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d  (245&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2016 to 74&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (468&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2040. Production growth in the oil  sands provides a growing market for pentanes plus, where it is used as <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#diluent">diluent</a>.</li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, NGL production is slightly lower due to  somewhat lower natural production projections. Total NGL production reaches 172&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.1  MMb/d) in 2040, 7% lower than in the Reference Case.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>NGLs are a by-product of natural gas production,  and the uncertainties identified in the Natural Gas  section are uncertainties to the NGL projections.</li>
  <li>The rate of oil sands production growth, and  proportion of bitumen that is upgraded, will affect the demand for pentanes  plus required for diluent. Likewise, greater use of solvent technologies in the  oil sands could increase the market for propane and butanes, which could impact  those production projections.     </li>

<h2 id="s7">Electricity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In 2015, installed electricity generation  capacity in Canada reached 145&nbsp;gigawatts (GW). Hydroelectricity remains  the primary source of electric power, accounting for 55% of total capacity and 58%  of generation. Natural gas, coal, nuclear and non-hydro renewables, including  wind, solar, and biomass, provide most of the remaining supply.</li>
  <li>The electricity supply mix varies significantly  among the provinces and territories, reflecting the types of energy available,  economic considerations, and policy choices in each region. Quebec, B.C.,  Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Yukon have significant hydroelectric  resources which are used to supply most of their electricity needs.  Saskatchewan and Alberta have historically relied on locally abundant coal  resources but have recently expanded their natural gas-fired fleet. Nuclear  power plants make up approximately one-third of Ontario&rsquo;s capacity, with  natural gas and hydro providing much of the remaining power. The Maritime  provinces rely on a combination of hydro, various fossil fuels, nuclear, and  non-hydro renewable resources. Diesel-fueled plants account for most of the  capacity in Nunavut and NWT.</li>
  <li>In 2015, Canadian electricity demand was 522&nbsp;terawatt-hours  (TW.h) and accounted for 17% of total Canadian end-use energy demand. From 1990  to 2015, Canadian electricity demand increased by an average of 1% per year. In  the Reference Case, electricity demand increases at an average annual rate of 0.9%  over the projection period.</li>
  <li>Figure 3.16 shows additions and retirements of  generating capacity over the projection period. The majority of additions to  capacity in the Reference Case are natural gas, wind, and hydro facilities,  accounting for 85% of the 54 GW added from 2016 to 2040. The remaining  additions include 6.4 GW of solar, 1.1 GW of biomass and 0.4 GW of coal  equipped with CCS technology. Coal, nuclear and oil-fired facilities, along with  some older natural gas-fired facilities, make up the bulk of retirements. </li>

	<h3>Outlook by Fuel</h3>
    <h4>Hydro</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Hydroelectricity remains the dominant source of  electricity supply in Canada over the projection period. Hydro power has  numerous advantages, including flexibility, relative affordability, lack of GHG  emissions at the operation stage, and cost-stability. With its capability to  store water and to change output as needed, Canada&rsquo;s hydro capacity also  facilitates the development of intermittent renewable resources such as wind  and solar.</li>
      <li>Hydro-based capacity, including small hydro and  run-of-river facilities, increases from 80 GW in 2016 to 89 GW in 2040. This  capacity expansion reflects a number of large hydro projects currently under  construction or in the planning and development phases. </li>
      <li>As a result of hydro-based capacity expansions,  annual hydroelectricity production increases from 377&nbsp;TW.h in 2016 to 413&nbsp;TW.h  in 2040 in the Reference Case. Due to faster growth in other forms of  generation, such as wind and natural gas, the share of hydroelectricity declines  slightly over the projection period from 58% in 2016 to 56% in 2040.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Non-hydro Renewables</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Canada  has considerable non-hydro renewable resource potential including wind,  biomass, solar, tidal, wave, and geothermal. Over the past 5 years, policy  incentives and declining costs have spurred significant growth in the use of  some of these technologies. In 2015, Canada had 16&nbsp;GW of wind, solar, and <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#biomass">biomass</a> capacity,  nearly triple 2010 levels. Most wind power capacity is in Ontario, Quebec, and  Alberta, while the majority of solar capacity is in Ontario.</li>
      <li>As shown in Figure 3.17, non-hydro renewable  capacity continues to grow in the Reference Case, more than doubling to 39 GW by  2040. Wind capacity increases from 12 GW in 2016 to 27 GW in 2040, with nearly  60% of that increase in Alberta. Solar capacity more than triples, increasing  from 2.3 GW in 2016 to 8.6 GW in 2040, with the majority of growth in Ontario,  Quebec, and Alberta. Biomass generation capacity grows steadily, from 2.7 GW in  2016 to 3.5 GW by the end of the projection period. </li>
    </ul>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This stacked column chart breaks down total growth in non-hydro renewable capacity generation in the reference case, by source. Solar capacity increases from 2.3 GW in 2016 to 8.6 GW by 2040. Wind capacity increases from 11.9 GW in 2016 to 26.6 GW by 2040. Biomass capacity increases from 2.7 GW in 2016 to 3.5 GW by 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Recent cost declines, particularly for solar,  play a role in increasing renewable capacity as do various government plans and  policies. This includes Alberta&rsquo;s Renewable Energy Program, which adds 5 GW of  renewable capacity by 2030, and Saskatchewan&rsquo;s goal of increasing its renewable  capacity to 50% of total capacity by 2030. Generation from these sources  increases from 45&nbsp;TW.h in 2016 to 98&nbsp;TW.h in 2040 in the Reference Case, accounting  for 13% of all electricity generated. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Nuclear</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Nuclear energy accounted for 15% of total  electricity generation in Canada in 2015. Ontario&rsquo;s three nuclear facilities had  a combined capacity of nearly 14 GW in 2015 and generated 58% of the province&rsquo;s  electricity. New Brunswick&rsquo;s single nuclear facility generated a third of the  province&rsquo;s power in 2015.</li>
  <li>Annual nuclear generation declines from 92&nbsp;TW.h  in 2016 to 82&nbsp;TW.h in 2040 in the Reference Case due to the shutdown of  Ontario&rsquo;s Pickering Nuclear facility in 2024. Through much of the projection  period, nuclear generation is somewhat lower than current levels due to outages  of several nuclear units in Ontario that are scheduled for refurbishment. No  new nuclear units are built during the projection period.</li>
  <li>Non-emitting generation sources: hydro,  renewables and nuclear, contribute 82% of generation by 2040 in the Reference  Case. Despite considerable additions of non-hydro renewables, this is only up  slightly from 80% in 2016 as natural gas-fired generation is also added over  the projection period to meet increasing load growth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Coal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Coal-fired generation facilities accounted for 6%  of installed capacity in 2015, and generated 9% of all electricity. Currently  four provinces operate coal-fired power plants: Alberta, Saskatchewan, New  Brunswick and Nova Scotia. </li>
  <li>Federal regulations apply a strict emission performance standard to units  that have reached the end of their useful lives, essentially requiring them to  be shut down or retrofitted with CCS technology. In 2015, Alberta announced  plans to accelerate the phase out of its coal fleet, requiring traditional coal  plants to be phased out by 2030. In autumn 2016, the federal government announced  its intention to amend its existing coal regulations to phase out traditional  coal-fired facilities by 2030 rather than at the end of their economic lives. </li>
  <li>As a  result of these initiatives, coal capacity declines considerably over  the projection period. EF2017  assumes equivalency agreements are reached in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and  Nova Scotia, allowing those provinces to keep some traditional coal capacity in  place after 2030. That capacity is used sparingly in the 2030 to 2040  timeframe. Figure 3.18 shows coal capacity by province over the projection  period, as well as the capacity utilization of the existing plants.</li>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph breaks down projected coal-fired generation capacity by province in the Reference Case, while also displaying coal capacity utilization rates throughout the projection period. Alberta's coal fired capacity decreases from 6.29 GW in 2015 to zero in 2030, where it remains for the remainder of the projection. Nova Scotia's coal fired capacity decreases from 1.25 GW in 2015 to 0.79 GW by 2040. New Brunswick’s coal fired capacity does not change throughout the projection, producing 0.49 GW from 2015 to 2040. Saskatchewan's coal fired capacity decreases from 1.42 GW in 2015 to zero in 2037, where it remains for the remainder of the projection. Conversely, Saskatchewan's coal generation capacity using carbon capture and storage technology increases from 0.12 GW from 2015 to 0.51 GW by 2040. Overall utilization of coal-fired capacity decreases from 73% in 2015 to 30% in 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Saskatchewan currently has one coal-fired  generation station that is equipped with CCS technology. The Boundary Dam facility  was put into operation in autumn 2014 and as of May 2017, it has captured 1.6&nbsp;MT of CO<sub>2</sub>. Over the projection period, three  additional Saskatchewan coal units are retrofitted with CCS technology,  providing 0.4 GW of capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Natural Gas</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Natural gas-fired capacity accounted for 15% of total  capacity in 2015, with 22 GW installed. All regions in Canada other than Prince  Edward Island and Nunavut use natural gas to generate some electricity,  although its share is most significant in Alberta and Saskatchewan. </li>
  <li>Natural gas-fired capacity increases steadily  over the projection period. As a result of relatively low fuel prices and  upfront capital costs, natural-gas fired capacity replaces much of the coal  capacity that is retired over the projection period. In the Reference Case,  natural gas capacity nearly doubles from 21.5 GW in 2016 to 41.7 GW in 2040. Figure  3.19 shows generation from natural gas and coal over the projection period.</li>

<img src="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/mg/fg03-19-eng.jpg" alt="Figure 3.19 - Generation by Natural Gas and Coal Plants, Reference Case" class="center-block img-responsive">
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graphs compares projected electricity generation by natural gas plants to coal plants in the Reference Case for all of Canada. While natural gas plant generation increase from 66.06&nbsp;TW.h in 2015 to 128.05&nbsp;TW.h in 2040, coal decreases from 62.26&nbsp;TW.h in 2015 to 4.14&nbsp;TW.h in 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>Natural gas capacity also increases as a result  of increasing use of intermittent renewable resources such as wind and solar.  Greater production from intermittent generation sources requires grid operators  to be able to accommodate fluctuations in both electricity consumption and production.  This makes natural gas plants&rsquo; ability to increase or decrease generation  quickly an attractive quality, especially in provinces without large scale  hydro resources. Chapter 4: Technology Case Results, discusses some of the  options available to integrate intermittent renewables.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Oil</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Oil-fired power plants accounted for only 2.5%  of total Canadian installed capacity in 2015 but are an important part of the  electricity supply mix in some smaller provinces and territories. Oil-fired  power plants, which mostly run on diesel, are used to generate electricity  during peak demand periods or in areas where other generation options are not  widely available.</li>
  <li>Total oil-fired capacity declines from 3.8 GW in  2016 to 3.3 GW in 2040. This reflects the retirements of aging units, which are  being replaced by renewable power, natural gas or LNG-fired units when  possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>HCP Case Electricity Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Higher carbon pricing has a modest overall  impact on Canada&rsquo;s electricity sector. Reasons for this include:
    <ul>
      <li>Canada  already has a low emitting electricity sector, with hydro, renewables, and  nuclear making up the majority of generation. Carbon pricing more directly  impacts emitting resources which make up a smaller portion of Canada&rsquo;s  electricity supply.</li>
      <li>Numerous  climate policies already target the electricity sector, particularly the phase  out of traditional coal-fired generation. As a result, the impact of higher  carbon pricing is muted compared to scenarios in which those policies are not in  place.</li>
      <li>Many  types of generating facilities have high upfront capital costs and long  economic lives. As a result, the electricity mix can be slow to change in  response to changing fuel prices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, higher fuel prices, and hence  higher electricity prices, result in somewhat lower electricity consumption  over the projection period. By 2040, electricity use is 1.1% lower compared to  the Reference Case. This results in slightly lower generation by most  generation types over the projection period, although the biggest reduction is  for coal and natural gas. Figure 3.20 shows cumulative generation from 2022 to  2040, by fuel type, in the HCP Case compared to the Reference Case. Solar  capacity grows somewhat more quickly in the HCP Case due to higher carbon pricing,  resulting in greater solar generation compared to the Reference Case. </li>
</ul>

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This chart compares the cumulative difference in electricity generation, by fuel source, between the Reference and HCP Cases for the projection period. Throughout the projection period, hydro generation in the HCP Case is 6.83&nbsp;TW.h lower compared to the reference case, while wind generation is 8.33&nbsp;TW.h lower, coal is 26.53&nbsp;TW.h lower, and natural gas 51.1&nbsp;TW.h lower. Conversely, solar generation is 21.3&nbsp;TW.h higher in the HCP Case compared to the Reference Case, while nuclear is also 4&nbsp;TW.h higher in the HCP Case.</p>
</details>
<h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The capital costs associated with building  different generating technologies is an important factor in determining what  type of facilities are built. Future costs for technologies can be uncertain, particularly  for less mature technologies such as wind, solar, and CCS. Chapter 4 explores  the uncertainty associated with lower cost assumptions for these types of  technologies compared to the Reference Case.</li>
  <li>Strong growth in both utility-scale and rooftop  solar capacity in some southwestern U.S. states is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32172">creating new challenges  for grid operators</a>. High levels of solar generation during sunny hours  results in steep drops in non-solar generation in the morning and rapid  increases in the evening once the sun begins to set. This pattern is impacting  non-solar generation in those regions, favouring generators with the ability to  increase or decrease generation quickly. While most regions in Canada do not get  as much solar radiation as the U.S. southwest, the implications of much faster  growth in solar than projected in EF2017 is a key uncertainty.</li>
  <li>Electricity demand growth is an important factor  in determining future electricity supply. As a result, the uncertainties  identified in the &ldquo;Energy Demand&rdquo; section are uncertainties to the electricity  supply projections.</li>

<h2 id="s8">Coal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Total Canadian coal production in 2015 was 61.9 million  tonnes. There are two main types of coal produced in Canada, <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#thermalcoal">thermal</a> and <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#metallurgicalcoal">metallurgical</a> coal. As the fuel for coal-fired power generation, Canadian thermal coal  production is linked to the use of coal in the electricity sector, particularly  in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Metallurgical coal is primarily used for steel  manufacturing domestically and internationally. Much of Canada&rsquo;s metallurgical  coal production is exported and future production trends are linked to global  coal demand and prices.</li>
  <li>Thermal coal, mostly used for power generation,  accounted for 93% of total coal consumption in 2015 in Canada. In the Reference  Case, demand for thermal coal declines by 86% over the projection period,  falling from 37.7 million tonnes in 2016 to 5.4 million tonnes in 2040. Most of  the thermal coal consumed in 2040 is used in coal-fired generation facilities  equipped with CCS technology.  </li>
  <li>This declining trend is driven primarily by  retirements of coal-fired generation capacity resulting from regulations to  phase out traditional coal-fired power plants by 2030. In response to declining  domestic demand, production of thermal coal in Canada falls from 36.3 million  tonnes in 2016 to 7.9 million tonnes by 2040.</li>
  <li>Domestic demand for metallurgical coal used in  steel manufacturing peaks in 2019 at 3.0 million tonnes and declines slightly  over the projection period to 2.6 million tonnes in 2040. Global demand for  metallurgical coal grows moderately over the projection period, resulting in steady  growth in net exports from Canada. Total metallurgical coal production in  Canada increases from 26.9 million tonnes in 2016 to 30.5 million tonnes in  2040.</li>
  <li>Figure 3.21 shows Canadian production and  consumption of coal in Canada in 2016 and 2040 in the Reference and High Carbon  Price Cases. </li>

<img src="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/mg/fg03-21-eng.jpg" alt="Figure 3.21 - Canadian Coal Production and Disposition, Reference and High Carbon Price Cases" class="center-block img-responsive">
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graphs breaks down coal production and disposition in both the Reference and Higher Carbon Price Cases. Demand for thermal coal decreases from 37.7 million tonnes in 2016 to 5.4 million tonnes in the Reference Case, and 4.7 million tonnes in the Higher Carbon Price Case, by 2040. Metallurgical coal demand decreases from 2.9 million tonnes in 2016 to 2.6 million tonnes in the Reference Case, and 2.5 million tonnes in the Higher Carbon Price Case, by 2040. Net Exports increase from 22.7 million tonnes in 2015 to 30.4 million tonnes in the Reference Case, and 28.7 million tonnes in the Higher Carbon Price Case, by 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>In the HCP Case, coal production is 6% lower by  2040 compared to the Reference Case. Coal is a GHG-intensive fuel meaning that  the carbon costs per unit of energy are higher compared to other fossil fuels  when carbon is priced. As a result, utilization of coal-fired generation in the  HCP Case is lower compared to the Reference Case. In addition, the HCP Case  assumes greater global climate action than in the Reference Case, resulting in somewhat  lower global demand for metallurgical coal and lower exports of Canadian coal. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Global coal markets and price trends are a key  uncertainty for Canadian coal exports. If coal importing countries shift  further away from using coal, it is also possible that demand and prices could  decrease. It is also possible that global coal demand for steel and electricity  generation could be higher than anticipated and lead to greater exports as  well.<strong></strong></li>

<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2 id="s9">GHG Emissions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, energy use and GHG emissions in  Canada are closely related. The majority of GHGs emitted in Canada are a result  of fossil fuel combustion. Fossil fuels provide the vast majority of energy  used to heat homes and businesses, transport goods and people, and power  industrial equipment. Emissions from fossil fuels, including those used for the  production of energy, accounted for 81% of Canadian GHG emissions in 2015. The  remaining emissions are from non-energy sources such as agricultural and  industrial processes, and waste handling.</li>
  <li>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)  publishes Canada&rsquo;s official GHG projections in its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/publications/2016-greenhouse-gas-emissions-case.html" rel="external">Canada&rsquo;s  Emission Trends</a> report<strong> </strong>and in  Canada&rsquo;s <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/transparency-and-reporting/reporting-and-review-under-convention/national-communications-1" rel="external">Biennial  Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>.</li>
  <li>In the Reference Case, fossil fuel consumption increases  early in the projection period. By 2019 consumption peaks and is relatively  flat through the remainder of the projection period and is slightly lower than 2019  levels by 2040. Fossil fuel consumption in 2040 is 4.3% higher than in 2016,  and nearly 9% higher than in 2005. </li>
  <li>In the HCP Case, fossil fuel consumption also peaks  in 2019 and declines more quickly compared to the Reference Case. Fossil fuel  consumption in 2040 is 4% lower than in 2016, and is nearly the same as in  2005. Figure 3.22 shows fossil fuel consumption by fuel in the Reference and  HCP cases.</li>

<img src="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/mg/fg03-22-eng.jpg" alt="Figure 3.22 - Total Demand for Fossil Fuels, Reference and HCP Cases" class="center-block img-responsive">
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This chart shows total demand for fossil fuels in both the Reference and HCP Cases. Total demand for coal, coke, and coke oven gas in the Reference Case decreases from 694&nbsp;PJ in 2015, to 640&nbsp;PJ in 2020, 207&nbsp;PJ in 2030, and 191&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Likewise, total demand for coal, coke, and coke oven gas in the HCP Case decreases from 694&nbsp;PJ in 2015, to 639&nbsp;PJ in 2020, 197&nbsp;PJ in 2030, and 175&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Total demand for refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids in the Reference Case increases initially from 4 658&nbsp;PJ in 2015, to 4828&nbsp;PJ in 2020, before decrease to 4 637&nbsp;PJ in 2030, and 4 509&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Likewise, total demand for refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids in the HCP Case increases initially from 4 658&nbsp;PJ in 2015, to 4 832&nbsp;PJ in 2020, before decrease to 4 588&nbsp;PJ in 2030, and 4 357&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Total demand for natural gas in the Reference Case increases from 4 471&nbsp;PJ in 2015 to 5 100&nbsp;PJ in 2020, 5 602&nbsp;PJ in 2030, and 5 729&nbsp;PJ in 2040. Total natural gas demand in the HCP Case increases initially from 4 471&nbsp;PJ in 2015 to 5 091&nbsp;PJ in 2020 and 5 264&nbsp;PJ in 2030, before decreasing to 5 067&nbsp;PJ in 2040.</p>
</details>
<ul>
  <li>While total fossil fuel consumption grows in the  Reference Case, a changing fuel mix  leads to declining GHGs per unit of fossil fuel energy used, as shown in Figure  3.23. Growth in natural gas, coupled with a steep drop in coal, results in GHG  intensity declining by 7.5% from 2016 to 2040, or 14% from 2005 to 2040.  Capturing carbon from facilities that employ CCS technology also reduces the  GHG intensity of fossil fuel use. The GHG intensity of the fuel mix in the HCP Case  is similar to the Reference Case. Accounting for reductions in non-combustion  emissions, such as reducing methane leaks, as well as including emission  credits purchased through international trading mechanisms (such as Ontario and  Quebec&rsquo;s emission trading with California) could further decrease emissions  intensity.</li>

<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This chart shows the estimated weighted average GHG emission intensity of fossil fuel consumption for both the Reference and HCP cases over the projection period. In the Reference Case, grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per MJ decrease from 59.64 in 2015 to 54.91 in 2040. In the HCP Case, grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per MJ decrease from 59.64 in 2015 to 54.73 in 2040.</p>

<h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The uncertainties identified in the Energy Demand  section of this chapter, such as future climate policies and technology  development, are also key uncertainties to the fossil fuel combustion-related GHG  emission results. </li>

              Table A.1 describes many recent climate policy developments and
              whether that policy is included in the analysis of EF2017.
              Policies already implemented as of summer 2015, such as
              Quebec&rsquo;s cap-and-trade system and B.C.&rsquo;s carbon tax,
              are not included in the table but are still incorporated in the
              projections.
            </li>
            <li>
              EF2017 includes many recently announced climate policies. The
              following criteria were applied to determine whether a certain
              policy was included in EF2017:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The policy was publically announced prior to January 2017.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sufficient detail exists to credibly model a policy, or
                  reasonable assumptions can be made about the details of a
                  policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Goals and targets, including Canada&rsquo;s international
                  climate targets, are not explicitly modelled. Rather, the
                  policies currently in place to address those targets are
                  included.
                </li>

                    A national carbon price is included in EF2017. Key
                    assumptions regarding the inclusion of this policy are
                    described in Chapter 2, Key Assumptions.<br /><br />

                    In all cases, the minimum carbon price starts at $10/tonne
                    in 2018 and increases by $10/tonne per year to reach
                    $50/tonne in 2022. This is consistent with the minimum
                    carbon price for jurisdictions with an explicit price-based
                    system in the Pan-Canadian approach to carbon pricing.
                    <br /><br />

                    In the Reference Case, the carbon price is held at $50/tonne
                    from 2022 to 2040. In the HCP and Technology Cases, the
                    price continues to increase, reaching $90/tonne in 2030 and
                    $140/tonne in 2040. The same carbon price is applied to all
                    provinces and territories regardless of existing carbon
                    pricing intentions as a simplifying assumption<em>.</em>

                    >passed legislation in June 2016 that enables the regulation
                    of GHG emissions from industrial facilities in the
                    province</a
                  >. The plan will include a form of carbon pricing for
                  industrial emitters, the revenues of which will support
                  funding of emission-reducing technology.

            Energy Futures Supplement (EFS) is a companion publication to the
            National Energy Board’s <em>Energy Futures</em> series of long-term
            Canadian energy supply and demand outlooks. EFS compliments the
            Energy Futures projections by exploring additional areas of
            long-term interest for Canada’s energy system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central projection of the Board’s <em>Energy Futures</em> series
            is the Reference Case.<sup

            >
            A Reference Case includes baseline projections based on the assumed
            macroeconomic outlook and energy prices, and government policies and
            programs that were law or near-law at the time the report was
            prepared. The Board also explores alternative possibilities in its

            <em>EFS: Demand Sensitivities</em> develops additional sensitivity
            cases that focus on several sector-specific areas related to
            Canadian energy use. These cases differ from the broader
            sensitivities covered in the <em>Energy Futures</em> publications,
            such as the High and Low Price Cases presented in
            <em

              to 2035</em

          <p>
            An important characteristic of energy demand is that it is a derived
            demand. This means that energy users do not demand energy for its
            own sake, but rather for the services it provides (such as driving a
            car, heating a home, or running equipment). The amount and type of
            energy that is used depends on the demand for these services and
            also the energy-using technology used to provide them. The
            sensitivity cases in <em>EFS: Demand Sensitivities</em> change
            specific assumptions related to the demand for services and the
            technological characteristics, such as energy efficiency and fuel
            type. Aside from these changes, all other assumptions and key
            drivers are kept at Reference Case levels.

          <h3>Issue and Background</h3>
          <p>
            Changing population and demographic trends are expected to have an
            impact on future economic and energy use trends. This appears to be
            particularly true for the case of transportation, as was highlighted
            in the Energy Context section of EF&nbsp;2013. Using the available
            Canadian data,<sup><a href="#ftn3back" id="ftn3">[3]</a></sup>
            Figure&nbsp;1 illustrates several key trends in population and
            transportation by comparing driving-age people under&nbsp;45 as well
            as 45 and older.

                This figure illustrates various trends in demographics and
                driving behaviour in Canada. Figure&nbsp;1a shows that the share
                of Canada’s population under 45&nbsp;years old decreased from
                64&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2000 to 61&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2001.
                Figure&nbsp;1b shows that between 2000 and 2011, the licensing
                rate, which is the share of a given age group population with a
                driver’s licence, declined for younger age groups and increased
                for older age groups. Figure&nbsp;1c shows that the vehicle
                kilometres travelled per licensed driver increased for older age
                groups, but declined for younger age groups, between 2000 and
                2009. Figure&nbsp;1d shows that total vehicle km travelled
                increased for older age groups, but declined for younger age
                groups, between 2000 and 2009.

            These charts illustrate several trends in Canadian demographics and
            transport demand over recent history:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Older age groups are becoming a larger share of the population.
            </li>
            <li>
              The licensing rate, which is the share of a given age group
              population with a driver’s licence, is declining for younger age
              groups and increasing for older age groups.
            </li>
            <li>
              Of those people that do have a driver’s licence, younger drivers
              are driving less, while older drivers are driving more.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result, total vehicle km (VKm) travelled by drivers in the
              younger age group fell over the period, and increased in the older
              age group.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Overall, total Vkm travelled by personal vehicles increased by
            approximately 20&nbsp;billion&nbsp;Km from 2000 to 2009. A
            statistical method called factorization analysis provides a way to
            analyse the relative impact of the changing trends shown in
            Figure&nbsp;1 on total Vkm travelled. This type of analysis is used
            by Natural Resources Canada in their
            <a
              href="https://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/data_e/publications.cfm"
              rel="external"
              >Energy Efficiency Trends Analysis</a
            >
            work as a way to separate the impact of activity, structural and
            intensity effects on energy use. Figure&nbsp;2 applies this
            technique to VKm and demographic trends.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn4back" id="ftn4">[4]</a></sup
            >
            In this case the change in total Vkm travelled relative to 2000
            (dashed black line) is broken down into four effects: Population
            Effect, Demographic Structure Effect, Licensing Rate Effect, and
            Driving Intensity Effect. The sum of these four effects adds up to
            the total change in VKm in any given year.

                Figure&nbsp;2 illustrates the change in total vehicle km
                travelled in Canada relative to 2000, broken down into various
                effects that influence travel use. It shows that rising
                population and an aging demographic structure has an upward
                impact on vehicle km travelled, changes in the licensing rate
                had a limited impact, and changes in driving intensity had a
                downward impact on vehicle km travelled.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Population Effect<em>:</em> the impact of overall driving-age
              population growth over the time period. Population increased
              steadily over this period, so there is an increase of the driving
              age population which leads to upward pressure on the total VKm
              travelled.
            </li>
            <li>
              Demographic Structure Effect: the impact of the changing age
              structure of the population. Older age groups increased their
              share of the population over this period. Since older age groups
              tended to drive more, the aging of the population leads to further
              upward pressure on total VKm travelled.
            </li>
            <li>
              Licensing Rate Effect: the impact of the changing share of
              licensed drivers within a given age group. As Figure&nbsp;2 shows,
              this impact had a small effect over the period, suggesting the
              impact of a decreasing licensing rate among younger generations is
              offset by an increasing licensing rate among older generations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Driving Intensity Effect: the impact of changes in how much
              licensed drivers actually drive. This is the key effect reducing
              overall driving activity. Although Figure&nbsp;1 shows that
              licensed drivers from older age groups drive more over this
              period, on an aggregate level, the decline in driving activity
              among younger drivers has a bigger impact.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Figure&nbsp;2 highlights the importance of demographic trends in
            driving behavior and the significant impact that reduced driving by
            younger age groups is having on overall transport activity. There is
            a growing body of research devoted to unravelling these trends
            further, although much of it focuses on similar trends in the United
            States (U.S.)<sup><a href="#ftn5back" id="ftn5">[5]</a></sup>
            Explanations for these changing patterns are varied and include: the
            impact of rising costs (including fuel, purchase, maintenance and
            insurance), changing income and employment trends, socioeconomic and
            cultural factors, and changing technology.

          <h3>Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Given this uncertainty, two sensitivity cases are created to explore
            the potential future impacts of these trends on energy use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              High VKm Case: trends of increased driving intensity and licensing
              rates from the older age groups continue, while the decreasing
              trends from younger age groups flatten and/or reverse.
            </li>
            <li>
              Low VKm Case: trends of decreasing driving intensity and licensing
              rates from the younger age groups continue, while the increasing
              trends from older age groups flatten and/or reverse.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Table&nbsp;1 shows the average annual growth rate for VKm in
            personal vehicles and passenger energy use over the projection
            period. Energy prices, population trends (including overall growth
            and demographic structure), and other macroeconomic variables remain
            at the Reference Case levels.

          <h2 id="s2">Chapter 2. Long-term Uncertainties in Natural Gas Use</h2>
          <p>
            EF&nbsp;2013 projects natural gas to be the fastest growing fuel in
            Canadian primary demand over the projection period. Figure&nbsp;4
            shows the growth in natural gas primary demand relative to 2013 by
            sector. Overall, primary natural gas demand increases by an average
            annual rate of 1.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (approximately
            1&nbsp;900&nbsp;PJ or 5&nbsp;billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d))
            from 2012 to 2035. The projected growth in natural gas use is
            dominated by increases in power generation and industrial use. The
            power generation demand growth is driven by retiring coal units, as
            well as meeting increasing demands for electricity. Key drivers of
            the industrial growth include use by natural resource industries,
            such as oil sands and other energy-intensive industries. The growth
            in transportation use is notable as well: although it is a fairly

          <h4>Issue and Background</h4>
          <p>
            In recent years, there has been interest in capitalizing on the
            price differential between crude oil and natural gas (Figure&nbsp;5)
            by substituting natural gas for oil products. The transportation
            sector uses the majority of liquid fuels in the U.S. and Canada,
            representing a target for oil-to-natural gas substitution.

                Figure&nbsp;5 compares trends in the price of crude oil (using
                the WTI oil price at Cushing, OK) and various natural gas price
                benchmarks: AECO Hub (Alberta), Dawn Hub (Ontario), and Henry
                Hub (Louisiana). It shows that on an energy equivalent basis,
                the differential between crude oil and natural gas prices has
                been much higher in recent years than it was in 2004 and 2005.
                However, it has narrowed substantially with the recent decline
                in crude oil price.

            Much of the interest in natural gas as a transportation fuel is for
            medium and heavy duty freight trucks. As noted in EF&nbsp;2013, this
            interest is primarily in operations where the vehicles return to
            central locations often and use regional transport corridors.
            Several fueling stations are in place or are currently being
            constructed in key strategic highway locations. An emerging area of
            interest is using natural gas as a fuel for rail freight transport.

            There are a variety of additional costs and uncertainties with
            switching from crude oil to natural gas. The capital cost of
            incremental natural gas vehicles (NGVs) and locomotives are higher
            than their diesel counterparts.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn8back" id="ftn8">[8]</a></sup
            >, <sup><a href="#ftn9back" id="ftn9">[9]</a></sup> There are a
            variety of infrastructure concerns, particularly related to
            refueling. Also, the persistency of the differential is uncertain
            and can be volatile, particularly with the recent natural gas price
            increases in winter 2013 and the recent declines in oil prices
            (Figure&nbsp;5).
          </p>
          <h4>Sensitivity Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The EF&nbsp;2013 demand projections included a modest penetration of
            natural gas in the freight transportation sector. To explore the
            impact of additional natural gas use for freight transportation, two
            additional sensitivity cases are created. These sensitivity cases
            are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The High NGV Case:  assumes a higher penetration rate of medium
              and heavy duty natural gas powered freight trucks than in the
              Reference Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              High NGV+Rail Case: penetration of NGV trucks consistent with the
              High NGV case, combined with a high penetration of natural
              gas-powered locomotives in rail freight transportation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are two options in using natural gas for vehicles: compressed
            natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Due to the size
            constraints imposed on CNG fuel tanks resulting from CNG’s high
            diesel gallon equivalency (DGE),<sup
              ><a href="#ftn10back" id="ftn10">[10]</a></sup
            >
            it is most suited for short-haul applications and is assumed to be
            adopted only by medium duty vehicles (MDVs). With a lower DGE and a
            shorter shelf-life,<sup
              ><a href="#ftn11back" id="ftn11">[11]</a></sup
            >
            LNG can handle larger amounts of fuel for both long-hauls and other
            applications that require constant fuel use. LNG is therefore
            assumed to be adopted by heavy duty vehicles (HDVs) and train
            locomotives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the High NGV Case, NGV adoption targets are created based on the
            Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) 2012
            <em>Issues in Focus</em> section of its
            <em>Annual Energy Outlook</em> (AEO) and other external reports.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn12back" id="ftn12">[12]</a></sup
            >
            The number of medium and heavy NGVs in the High NGV Case are shown
            in Figure&nbsp;6. The number of NGVs in the High NGV Case increases
            to over 200&nbsp;000&nbsp;vehicles by 2035, while the Reference Case
            projection was consistent with 50&nbsp;000 to 60&nbsp;000&nbsp;MDVs
            and HDVs.

                duty natural gas vehicles that are assumed in the High NGV Case.
                The total number of NGVs in the High NGV Caseincreases to over

            Locomotive adoption targets are based upon the ‘High Rail LNG’ Case
            from the EIA’s projection in the <em>Issues in Focus</em> section of
            the AEO 2014. This Case involves a transformative change in the rail
            industry, where natural gas meets 95&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of freight
            rail energy demands by 2040 (approximately 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in
            2030).

                in three cases: the Reference Case, the High NGV Case, and the
                High NGV+Rail Case. By 2035, natural gas use is
                300&nbsp;petajoules higher in the High NGV case compared to the
                Reference Case, while diesel is 287&nbsp;petajoules lower.

            Figure&nbsp;8 illustrates how the freight transportation (excluding
            air) fuel mix changes between the cases in 2020 and 2035. In 2020,
            the difference between the cases is limited, with the share of
            natural gas in the NGV+Rail Case approximately
            one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent higher than in the Reference Case. This
            limited medium term impact illustrates the gradual nature of
            adopting a new technology. By 2035 the impact is larger: natural gas
            accounts for 23&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of freight demand in the NGV
            Case, and 27&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in the NGV+Rail Case, relative to

          <h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Natural Gas Intensity for Oil Sands</h3>
          <h4>Issue and Background</h4>
          <p>
            In EF&nbsp;2013, natural gas use by the oil sands is one of the key
            growth areas for overall energy use. Purchased natural gas
            requirements for the oil sands (including cogeneration) rise to
            95.1&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (3.4&nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2035. Much of
            this growth is from in situ production, which EF&nbsp;2013 projects
            to be the largest source of oil production growth over the
            projection period. The thermal in situ process is energy intensive,
            involving injecting steam into the ground to heat up the bitumen in
            the oil reservoir, reducing its viscosity enough to be pumped to the
            surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            In situ’s Steam Oil Ratio (SOR) is the ratio of the volume of steam
            required to produce the same volume of oil. Higher SORs are the
            result of more steam being used to produce a barrel of oil. Since
            natural gas is used to create the steam, the SOR is a measure of
            natural gas intensity.
          </p>
          <p>There are a variety of ways to measure SOR:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Instantaneous SOR (iSOR): iSORs are loosely defined as the SOR of
              a facility or reservoir at a given moment in time, which is
              typically measured from monthly production. iSORs are higher at
              initial production stages as more energy is needed to overcome
              some production inertia. When production becomes consistent, iSORs
              decline, with the rate of decline plateauing after several years.
              Maturing reservoirs may start to exhibit a modest iSOR increase as
              more effort is needed to keep up current production rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Annual SORs at Project Level: ratio of a project’s annual steam
              usage to annual bitumen production. This measure provides a useful
              way of comparing the annual efficiency performance of various
              sites across time. Figure 9 displays annual SORs for various
              Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) and Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage
              (SAGD) projects from 2009 to 2013<sup

              and illustrates the variation that exists between them. The points
              are scaled by the facilities’ production levels, with larger
              circles representing higher production. Figure&nbsp;9 illustrates
              that extreme outliers in terms of SOR (both high and low) often
              are producing at low levels.

              production-weighted SOR than SAGD. Figure 9 highlights this as
              well, as the blue circles have most of their area located above
              the area of the red circles. This high-level efficiency measure
              provides the basis for long-term energy modeling analysis.

                Figure&nbsp;10 illustrates historical aggregate
                production-weighted SOR values. It shows the aggregate
                production weighted SOR for the top 3&nbsp;SAGD facilities from
                2002 to 2014. From 2009 to 2014, aggregate data for CSS, SAGD
                and total in situ facilities are shown. The figure shows that
                SAGD SOR levels declined significantly from 2002 to 2014, and
                that CSS production has a consistently higher
                production-weighted SOR than SAGD.

            * Top Three SAGD producers are Foster Creek, Firebag and Mackay
            River, which represented a large majority of production from
            2002-2008 and therefore offer a good measure of in Situ's aggregate
            production-weighted SOR over that period.

          <p>
            Despite the fact that in situ’s SOR has declined since the inception
            of SAGD in 2002, the recent flat-line in Figure 10, as well as the
            volatility shown in Figure&nbsp;9, is indicative of the current
            uncertainty regarding where energy intensity is heading. While the
            distribution of CSS SOR data has exhibited fairly consistent SORs
            over the five year period, SAGD has seen variation persist around
            the SOR level of three, so it is unclear where the overall values
            are trending.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding to the future uncertainty is that these charts only account
            for existing facilities. Much of the incremental production over the
            EF&nbsp;2013 projection period will involve exploiting new reservoir
            types with methods which have unknown natural gas intensities.
            Recent projects have encountered increasing levels of
            heterogeneity<sup><a href="#ftn15back" id="ftn15">[15]</a></sup> in
            the reservoir rock. This has increased the steam requirements for
            many facilities and in turn, spurred the continuing pursuit of
            innovative solutions to enhance SAGD recovery and reduce the SOR.
            Examples of such innovations include injecting methane or solvent
            with steam, and drilling vertical infill wells between SAGD wells in
            an attempt to recover bitumen from outside of the reservoirs that
            have been mobilized by heat escaping from them. These, along with
            several other innovative processes, are currently being implemented
            or are in the testing phase. Work is also being done to identify an
            economic means of exploiting the bitumen locked in the Grosmont
            carbonates, with the most notable method being
            electromagnetic-assisted SAGD, where electrodes are inserted into
            wells that can target the bitumen for heating with electromagnetic
            radiation.

          <p>Key questions for the future include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Will process improvements be enough to counter the challenges of
              heterogeneous reservoirs?
            </li>
            <li>
              Given these process improvements and heterogeneous reservoirs,
              what will the new facility-level SORs be and to what degree will
              they alter in situ’s aggregate production-weighted SOR?
            </li>
            <li>
              With in situ providing over 70&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
              incremental production over the EF forecast, and significant
              variations in SORs possible from year-to-year for a given well,
              what effect will a distribution of new and aging existing
              reservoirs have on aggregate production-weighted SORs in a given
              year of the projection?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Sensitivity Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The EF&nbsp;2013 Reference Case assumes a 0.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            decrease in the SOR over the forecast period. But future
            efficiencies may be higher or lower, depending on the answers to the
            above questions. Because of the uncertainty in natural gas
            efficiency and the fact that in situ production is expected to be
            such an integral component of the projection’s natural gas demand,
            it is worth exploring how natural gas use would change under
            alternative SOR assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To explore the uncertainty around in situ natural gas use and
            efficiency, three alternative sensitivity cases are created and
            compared to the Reference Case. These are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              High SOR Case: one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent annual increase in SOR over
              projection
            </li>
            <li>Constant SOR Case: constant SOR over projection</li>
            <li>
              Low SOR Case: two&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent annual decrease in SOR over
              projection
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Figure&nbsp;11 illustrates how these assumptions affect the SORs
            over the forecast period. Although these cases vary widely, the
            range of the aggregate SOR values shown in Figure 11 are within the
            majority of facility production-weighted SOR values shown in Figure
            9. It is important to note that this analysis assumes that oil sands
            production growth is equal to the Reference Case in the sensitivity
            cases. This may not hold. Higher or lower SOR values, implying
            higher or lower productivity and/or natural gas requirements by
            project, may alter project economics and impact production growth
            and therefore affect total oil sands natural gas requirements. This
            analysis ignores these dynamics in an effort to illustrate how
            sensitive both the oil sand requirements and the total Canadian
            demand for natural gas are to SOR assumptions in the EF&nbsp;2013
            projection.

                Figure&nbsp;11 shows the CSS and SAGD SOR values in 2035 for the
                Reference Case and alternative cases. In the Reference Case, the
                SOR values decline by 0.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per year. In the
                Constant SOR Case, the values are equivalent to 2012 levels. In
                the High SOR Case, the values increase by one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
                per year. In the Low SOR Case, the values decline by

            (1.81&nbsp;Bcf/d) between the High and Low SOR Cases in 2035. In
            2035, natural gas use in the High SOR Case is
            29.9&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (1.06&nbsp;Bcf/d) over the
            Reference Case, and 21.5&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d

          </p>
          <p>
            Altering the SOR assumptions has a notable impact on total Canadian
            natural gas demand. In the Reference Case, total primary natural gas
            demand increases at an average annual rate of
            1.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, approximately
            140&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (5&nbsp;Bcf/d; as shown in
            Figure&nbsp;4). In the High SOR Case, primary natural gas demand
            increases by over 170&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (6&nbsp;Bcf/d)
            over the projection period, an average annual growth of
            two&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per year. In the Low SOR Case, primary
            natural gas demand growth is 120&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
            (4.2&nbsp;Bcf/d), an average annual growth of 1.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
            per year. In 2035, total Canadian natural gas demand is
            eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent below the Reference Case in the Low SOR
            Case and six&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent above the Reference Case in the High
            SOR Case.

            2.3 Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Natural Gas Combined Cycle
            Power Generation
          </h3>
          <h4>Issue and Background</h4>
          <p>
            As noted in EF&nbsp;2013, federal regulations enacted in 2012
            require new coal plants to reduce GHG emissions to no more than 420
            metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) per gigawatt hour
            (GWh). The regulation outlines stringent performance standards for
            new coal-fired electricity generation units and units that have
            reached the end of their useful life. Effectively, any new coal
            facility built after July 2015 is equipped with CCS. In
            EF&nbsp;2013, several CCS facilities in Alberta and Saskatchewan
            come online over the projection period, reaching nearly
            2&nbsp;000&nbsp;MW of capacity in 2035. Much of the growth in CCS
            occurs after 2020, replacing retired coal units or as a retrofit to
            existing coal plants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both Alberta and Saskatchewan are endowed with rich coal resources
            and are pursuing CCS technology to take advantage of the abundant
            resource and to satisfy future electricity demand. In the past few
            years, Alberta and Saskatchewan have announced long-term strategies,
            projects and financial commitments to assist in the building of coal
            power plants with CCS technology. The $1.35&nbsp;billion Boundary
            Dam CCS project in Saskatchewan opened in 2014. It is the world’s
            first and largest commercial-scale CCS project, and is capable of
            producing 110&nbsp;MW.
          </p>
          <p>
            CCS is an emerging technology, and its long-term growth is
            uncertain. In the EF&nbsp;2013 Reference Case, natural gas-fired
            generation supplies the majority of future electricity requirements
            in the two provinces. The EIA estimates of capital costs and energy
            requirements for natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and CCS plants
            (Table&nbsp;2) show lower costs for NGCC on a per kW basis. The
            <em>Alberta Electric System Operator’s</em> (AESO)
            <em>2014 Long Term Outlook</em> anticipates no new coal-fired plants
            over the next 20&nbsp;years, mainly because of the unfavorable
            economics of CCS. Instead, the AESO <em>Outlook</em> anticipates
            combined cycle natural gas-fired generation to replace retiring
            coal-fired generation.

          <h4>Sensitivity Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            Considering these uncertainties, it is interesting to ask what the
            electricity and energy use impacts would be if the EF&nbsp;2013 CCS
            additions are replaced with natural gas. The Capacity Switch Case
            assumes that the long-term CCS capacity additions included in the
            Reference Case are removed and replaced with NGCC units with the
            same generating capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 13 compares Canada’s capacity mix in 2035 for the Reference
            and Capacity Switch Cases. Relative to the Reference Case, the share
            of natural gas increases in the Capacity Switch Case, and the share
            of coal declines. EF&nbsp;2013 projects Canada’s total installed
            capacity to be over 164&nbsp;000&nbsp;MW by 2035, so the shift of
            2&nbsp;000&nbsp;MW from coal to natural gas changes capacity shares
            by one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. This has the largest impact on coal use.
            The Capacity Switch Case shows that without the long-term CCS
            additions, projected coal capacity is lower than some renewable
            sources (non-hydro, non-wind<sup
              ><a href="#ftn19back" id="ftn19">[19]</a></sup
            >) while in the Reference Case the shares were about the same.

                capacity mix in 2035 for the Reference Case and the Capacity
                Switch Case. It shows that without the CCS additions assumed in
                the Reference Case, natural gas capacity is higher in the
                Capacity Switch Case (23&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, compared to
                22&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in the Reference Case) while coal and coke
                capacity is lower (three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, compared to

            Figure&nbsp;14 shows the share of natural gas-fired generation for
            Alberta and Saskatchewan in 2035 for the Reference and Capacity
            Switch Cases. The Reference Case values reflect strong growth in
            natural gas generation, with natural gas reaching
            68&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the 2035 generation mix in Alberta, and
            59&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in Saskatchewan.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn20back" id="ftn20">[20]</a></sup
            >
            In the Capacity Switch Cases, the reliance on natural gas generation
            is even higher. In Alberta, natural gas powers three quarters of the
            2035 generation in the Capacity Switch Case, while in Saskatchewan
            natural gas makes up nearly 65&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the generation
            mix.

                generation in 2035 between the Reference Case and the Capacity
                Switch Case for Alberta and Saskatchewan. It shows that in the
                Capacity Switch Case, the share of natural gas-fired generation
                in Alberta increases to 75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in the Capacity
                Switch Case, while in Saskatchewan it increases to
                65&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.

          <div class="clearfix"></div>
          <p>
            This shift also has implications for primary energy demand, as shown
            in Table&nbsp;3. In the Capacity Switch Case, Canadian coal demand
            for power generation is 34&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent or 130&nbsp;PJ
            (5.5&nbsp;Megatonnes) lower than the Reference Case in 2035. Natural
            gas demand for power generation becomes an even stronger driver for
            overall natural gas use. Canadian primary natural gas demand for
            power generation in the Capacity Switch Case is
            six&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent higher than the Reference Case in 2035
            (approximately 75&nbsp;PJ<sup

          <h3>Issue and Background</h3>
          <p>
            The future for LNG exports is a key uncertainty in Canada’s energy
            system. Currently there are a large number of proposed LNG export
            projects in British Columbia (B.C.) and a smaller number proposed on
            the East Coast. As of December 2014, none of the export project
            proponents have announced final investment decisions. To deal with
            this uncertainty, EF&nbsp;2013 assumed one&nbsp;Bcf/d of LNG exports
            in 2019, two&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2021 and three&nbsp;Bcf/d by 2023.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to future energy use, an important uncertainty of
            potential LNG exports is the energy required to power the LNG export
            facilities. According to BC Hydro, LNG-related electricity demand
            falls into two general categories: compression (liquefying natural
            gas) and non-compression. Energy demand for compression is
            approximately 85&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent<sup
              ><a href="#ftn22back" id="ftn22">[22]</a></sup
            >
            of the total plant’s energy needs. The remaining (non-compression)
            energy requirement is for plant pumps, motors, other equipment,
            heating and lighting.
          </p>
          <p>
            EF&nbsp;2013 assumes that all energy use related to LNG export
            facilities comes from natural gas-fired electricity plants. An
            additional 450&nbsp;MW combined cycle unit is added in each of the
            years 2019, 2021, and 2023, corresponding to each assumed increment
            of LNG exports. At an end-use level, the electricity used by these
            plants was included in the industrial energy demand projection for
            B.C.
          </p>
          <p>
            EF&nbsp;2013 also noted this was only one of several potential
            options for meeting this demand. New LNG export facilities have a
            number of options to power their facilities. These options include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Direct Drive: uses natural gas as a fuel source to turn gas
              turbines for the liquefaction process. In most LNG plants,
              compression requirements are typically supplied with direct drive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Electric Drive, Self-generation: uses large electric motors to
              drive the compressors. Power is generated on-site by the LNG
              producer using natural gas as fuel source.
            </li>
            <li>
              Electric Drive, Grid Purchases: uses large electric motors to
              drive the compressors. Power is purchased directly from the B.C.
              grid.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            BC Hydro projects LNG non-compression demand could be one of the
            biggest system loads, adding an additional peak demand ranging
            between 100 to 800&nbsp;MW. Compression demands are expected to be
            met with direct drive or self-generation.
          </p>

            power their facilities. These are included in Table&nbsp;3, and
            often involve some combination of the various options.

            The Woodfibre LNG project is planning to purchase power directly
            from the grid as they try to take advantage of existing
            infrastructure that is already in place. The Pacific Northwest LNG
            project plans to generate its own power for the compression process
            while considering grid purchase for the non-compression demand. The
            LNG Canada project description states their intention to use natural
            gas direct drive for the compression process while considering
            purchasing power from the grid for auxiliary power. Recently LNG
            Canada has announced<sup
              ><a href="#ftn25back" id="ftn25">[25]</a></sup
            >
            that, if their project proceeds, they will be using GE’s
            aeroderivative gas turbine for the compression process and power
            purchased form BC Hydro for the non-compression process. The Prince
            Rupert LNG project plans to design a self-sufficient facility where
            it has the capability to meet its entire power requirement.

          <h4>Sensitivity Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            To analyze the impact of alternative methods of powering LNG on B.C.
            energy use, two alternative sensitivity cases are developed and
            compared with the Reference Case. These cases maintain the
            EF&nbsp;2013 assumptions of one&nbsp;Bcf/d of LNG export in 2019,
            two&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2021 and three&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2023 (where it
            remains for the rest of the projection period), which are not
            related to any specific project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cases are described in Table&nbsp;5. The alternative cases both
            assume that compression demands (85&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total) are
            met by direct drive. This is in contrast to the Reference Case,
            where compression demands are met through electric drive. The
            alternative cases differ in how they treat non-compression demands.
            The Direct Drive/Self-generation Case assumes non-compression
            demands are met by self-generation via NGCC. The Direct Drive/Grid
            Purchase Case assumes that the non-compression requirement is met
            with electricity purchased from the grid.

            Figure&nbsp;15 shows B.C.’s total primary natural gas use in 2035
            for the three cases, disaggregated by sector. Overall, the
            difference between these cases is fairly nuanced. As the figure
            shows, overall primary natural gas demand does not change much
            between the Reference Case and the Direct Drive/Self-generation
            Case.<sup><a href="#ftn26back" id="ftn26">[26]</a></sup> However,
            the sector using the energy for compression does change, as the
            energy used to generate natural gas in the Reference Case is now
            used directly in the industrial sector by the LNG facilities.
            Non-compression demands are satisfied through natural gas-fired
            generation, as in the Reference Case.

                Figure&nbsp;15 compares B.C. natural gas demand by sector in
                2035 across the Reference Case, Direct Drive/Self-generation
                Case, and Direct Drive/Grid Purchase Case. It shows a higher
                percentage of natural gas used directly in the industrial sector
                for the alternative cases compared to the Reference Case. Also,
                the total natural gas used in the Direct Drive/Grid Purchase
                sector is 613&nbsp;petajoules, compared to 625&nbsp;petajoules
                in the other cases.

          <p>
            The Direct Drive/Grid Purchase Case is identical to the Direct
            Drive/Self-generation Case for compression demands. The difference
            occurs on the non-compression side. In the Self-generation Case,
            approximately 200&nbsp;MW of natural gas-fired capacity is added to
            satisfy this demand directly. In the Grid Purchase Case this
            capacity is not added, and the electricity demands
            (1&nbsp;500&nbsp;GWh by 2035) are met with electricity purchased
            from the grid. In this analysis, all other assumptions are constant
            at Reference Case levels, and so these incremental electricity
            requirements are met mostly through reduced net exports. However,
            other possibilities include adding additional capacity (such as
            renewables), or taking additional demand-saving actions.

          <h2 id="s5">About this Report</h2>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or Board) is an independent federal
            regulator whose purpose is to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and efficient infrastructure and markets in
            the Canadian public interest within the mandate set by Parliament
            for the regulation of pipelines, energy development, and trade.
          </p>
          <p>The Board's main responsibilities include regulating:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the construction, operation and abandonment of oil and gas
              pipelines that cross international borders or
              provincial/territorial boundaries, as well as the associated
              pipeline tolls and tariffs;
            </li>
            <li>
              the construction and operation of international power lines, and
              designated interprovincial power lines; and
            </li>
            <li>
              imports of natural gas and exports of crude oil, natural gas, oil,
              natural gas liquids (NGLs), refined petroleum products and
              electricity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, the Board has regulatory responsibilities for oil and
            gas exploration and production activities in frontier lands not
            otherwise regulated under joint federal/provincial accords. These
            regulatory responsibilities are set out in the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGO Act), the
            <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em> (CPR Act). For oil and
            natural gas exports, the Board’s role is to evaluate whether the oil
            and natural gas proposed to be exported is surplus to reasonably
            foreseeable Canadian requirements, having regard to the trends in
            the discovery of oil or gas in Canada. The Board monitors energy
            markets, and assesses Canadian energy requirements and trends in
            discovery of oil and natural gas to support its responsibilities
            under Part&nbsp;VI of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (the
            NEB Act). The Board periodically publishes assessments of Canadian
            energy supply, demand and markets in support of its ongoing market
            monitoring. These assessments address various aspects of energy
            markets in Canada. Canada’s

            is one such assessment that projects Canadian energy supply and
            demand trends out to 2035. This report,

            Canada’s energy system related to energy use.

            <a href="#ftn3" id="ftn3back">[3]</a> Vehicle travel data by age
            group comes from Statistics Canada’s Canadian Vehicle Survey, which
            was published between 2000 and 2009 (CANSIM table 405-0070). Since
            the Canadian Vehicle Survey data is estimated based on a sample
            population, each data point has an associated coefficient of
            variation which can be used to assess data quality and inferences
            made based on that data. Data on the number of licensed drivers
            comes from Transport Canada’s document

            <a href="#ftn8" id="ftn8back">[8]</a> There is not a consensus on
            what the incremental cost of a NGV actually is: it depends on the
            engine chosen, the number of tanks installed, the vehicle’s
            application and the original equipment manufacturer of the vehicle.
            Recent incremental estimates for medium and heavy duty vehicles have
            ranged between US&nbsp;$20&nbsp;000 and US&nbsp;$70&nbsp;000
            (Source: Work Truck Magazine; Fuel Space). Higher costs are
            generally associated with larger storage volumes.

            was used to construct a freight vehicle forecast and Marbek’s 2010
            study for the Canadian Natural Gas Vehicles Alliance (CNGVA) helped
            construct a BCHydro.ca2020 target for freight vehicles.

            increases by approximately 40&nbsp;PJ in the High NGV Case,
            following from the EIA’s AEO 2014 results that show a higher
            efficiency improvement for diesel freight trucks than natural
            gas-powered vehicles.

            <a href="#ftn15" id="ftn15back">[15]</a> Formations are called
            homogeneous if the rock formations do not change significantly
            throughout the reservoir and heterogeneous if they exhibit
            significant variability in the reservoir. Homogenous sand reservoirs
            are more predictable to produce from and generally require less
            steam than heterogeneous reservoirs, which have become a focal point
            for enhanced recovery research.

            as shown in Figure&nbsp;5.3 of EF&nbsp;2013. This figure only
            includes natural gas purchased by the oil sands industry. In
            addition to purchased gas, the oil sands industry also uses natural
            gas that is produced along with oil sands production.

            <a href="#ftn19" id="ftn19back">[19]</a> Wind is an interesting
            case. It has a relatively low capacity factor (approximately
            20-30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), so although it accounts for
            nine&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the capacity mix in 2035, it accounts for
            four&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the generation mix. In terms of
            generation, coal (which often provides base load generation at a
            higher capacity factor) accounts for five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of
            generation in the Reference Case by 2035. In the Capacity Switch
            case, however, coal-fired generation falls to
            three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, which is less than wind-powered
            generation.

            <a href="#ftn21" id="ftn21back">[21]</a> In energy terms, the
            decrease in coal use is greater than the increase in natural gas use
            as CCS units are expected to have a higher heat rate than natural
            gas combined cycle units, as illustrated in Table&nbsp;2. This means
            that CCS units require more energy to produce a kW of electricity
            than natural gas combined cycle units.

            gas use for compression demands is assumed to be the same for
            electric drive and direct drive. This follows from the LNG volumes
            being general assumptions not tied to specific projects. Demands may
            vary depending on the specific technology chosen to power a given
            project.

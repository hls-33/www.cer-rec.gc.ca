          <p>
            The National Energy Board&rsquo;s (NEB) Energy Futures (EF) series
            explores how possible energy futures might unfold for Canadians over
            the long term. EF analyses consider a range of impacts across the
            entire Canadian energy system. In order to cover all aspects of
            Canadian energy in one supply and demand outlook, the extensive
            crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) production
            analyses are described at a relatively high level. A series of
            supplemental reports is able to address impacts specific to the
            supply sector, creating an opportunity to provide additional detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Natural gas prices are a key driver of future natural gas production
            and a key uncertainty to the projections in the
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2018/index-eng.html"
              >Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2018: Energy Supply and Demand
              Projections to 2040</a
            >
            (EF2018). Natural gas prices could be higher or lower depending on
            demand, technology, geopolitical events, and the pace at which
            nations enact policies to reduce GHG emissions
          </p>
          <p>
            EF analysis assumes that over the long term, all energy produced,
            will find markets. The timing and extent to which particular markets
            emerge, whether demand growth over/undershoots local production,
            whether export/import opportunities arise, and whether new
            transportation infrastructure is built, are difficult to predict.
            This is why simplifying assumptions are made. The analysis in this

            This natural gas production supplemental report includes a detailed
            look at the Reference Case, followed by results from the other three
            cases. In the Technology Case, technological advances focus on oil
            sands production and not natural gas; therefore, natural gas prices
            are assumed to be the same in the Technology Case. The natural gas
            price assumptions in the High and Low Price cases differ
            significantly from the other cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            All cases have the same assumption for liquefied natural gas (LNG)
            exports from British Columbia (B.C.)&rsquo;s coast. LNG exports
            start at 0.75 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2025 and double
            in 2026 to reach 1.50 Bcf/d. Additional volumes are assumed in 2030,
            increasing total LNG exports to 2.25&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2030 and
            3.0&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2031. Figure 2.5 in
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2018/index-eng.html">EF2018</a> shows the
            assumed LNG export volumes. Additional natural gas production from
            LNG exports leads to additional NGL production.

          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              Canadian gas production has remained steady in the last few years
              despite declining gas prices since 2014 (Figure 2.1). This was
              driven by, in part, drilling to evaluate gas resources expected to
              supply LNG exports off Canada&rsquo;s West Coast. Meanwhile, new
              gas&ndash;processing plants helped debottleneck some
              gas&ndash;gathering systems. Most importantly, however, natural
              gas liquids in some gas plays drove gas drilling and production
              despite low gas prices, while the cold winter of 2017&ndash;18
              increased seasonal demand. Production is expected to remain steady
              to 2025 as low, western Canadian natural gas prices persist in the
              near term and are slowly alleviated by 2025 as infrastructure is
              built. After 2025, when LNG exports are assumed to begin,
              production starts to increase as gas prices<sup id="fn1-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"
                  ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a
                ></sup
              >
              rise and additional drilling to supply LNG exports occurs.
              Historical production in Canada peaked in 2001 at 495 million
              cubic metres per day (10 <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d) or 17.5
              billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d); in 2017 production was 442 10
              <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (15.6 Bcf/d) and by 2040 it&rsquo;s
              projected to increase by 34% to 593 10 <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d
              (20.9&nbsp;Bcf/d).
            </li>
            <li>
              Production from the Montney Formation, a large gas resource
              extending from northeast B.C. into northwestern Alberta, has grown
              significantly over the past six years. Production of Montney
              <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#tightgas">tight gas</a> increased
              from no production prior to 2006 to almost 149 10
              <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (5.3&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2017, or 34% of
              total Canadian natural gas production. The majority of Canadian
              production growth over the projection period comes from the
              Montney, with its production reaching 344 10
              <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (12.1&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040, or 58% of
              total Canadian gas production. The majority of gas that will
              supply LNG exports is assumed to be sourced from the Montney,
              leading to faster production growth around 2025 and 2030, as seen
              in Figure 2.1.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Alberta Deep Basin – a tight gas play which flanks the Alberta
              foothills – produced 95 10 <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d
              (3.4&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2017. Production grows modestly as natural gas
              and NGL prices increase, reaching 114 10
              <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (4.0&nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2040.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Duvernay and Horn River Basin shale gas plays currently
              produce small amounts of natural gas, and production from both
              grows modestly over the projection period. The Duvernay is an
              emerging shale play in Alberta that contains natural gas, NGLs and
              crude oil. The Horn River in northeastern B.C. is more
              established, but the formation lacks NGLs, and is currently
              uneconomic to drill. However, a small amount of the gas to be
              exported as LNG is assumed to come from Horn River Basin, and the
              slight increases in production can be seen in Figure 2.1.
              Combined, production from the two plays increases from 14 10
              <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (0.5&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2017 to 24 10
              <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (0.9&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040, with the
              Duvernay making up 60% of the total in 2040.

            <li>
              Natural gas production varies between the cases, especially for
              the High and Low Price cases (Figure 3.1). All cases show the same
              focus on more economic deep and tight gas resources. The
              projections for the rest of Canada, and for LNG exports, are the
              same in all four cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              In all cases except for the Low Price Case, production is expected
              to decline over the short term before eventually increasing from
              year to year to the end of the projection period. In the Low Price
              Case, sub&ndash;$4 per million British thermal units gas prices
              are not high enough to enable sufficient revenues to fund capital
              expenditures to drill enough new wells for production from new
              wells to outpace the decline in production from older wells. As a
              result, total production declines over the entire projection.
              Production drops to 355 10 <sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d
              (12.6&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040, or 40% lower than the Reference Case.

              higher than the Reference Case. This is largely from a compounding
              effect over the duration of the projection, where higher prices
              cause more drilling and more production – which in turn leads to
              more revenue. These higher revenues generate higher capital

              The Technology Case has carbon prices rising to $336/tonne in
              nominal dollars by 2040 – almost seven times as much as the other
              cases&rsquo; carbon price of $50/tonne. Gas prices are also
              slightly lower that the Reference Case (Figure 3.1). Lower gas
              prices and higher carbon costs result in less revenue and,
              therefore, less capital expenditures and less gas drilling,
              leading to lower gas production. Solution gas is also lower in
              this case since the projection of conventional oil production in
              the Technology Case is also lower<sup id="fn8-rf"

              This graph shows the projections for Canadian marketable natural
              gas production and Alberta natural gas price for all four cases.
              The Alberta natural gas price is in 2016 Canadian dollars per
              MMBtu. In the Reference Case price is projected to increase from
              $2.10 in 2017 to $3.89 in 2040, and production is projected in
              increase from 15.62&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2017 to 20.94&nbsp;Bcf/d in
              2040. In the Technology Case gas price is projected to increase to
              $3.52 in 2040, and production is projected to decrease to
              14.13&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the High Price Case gas price is
              projected to increase to $4.68 in 2040, and production is
              projected to increase to 26.67&nbsp;Bcf/d in 2040. In the Low
              Price Case gas price is projected to decrease to $2.89 in 2040,
              and production is projected to decrease to 12.55&nbsp;Bcf/d in
              2040.

              This analysis assumes that over the long term, all energy
              production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as
              needed. However, a lack of markets for Canadian natural gas
              production could reduce the prices Canadian producers receive
              relative to the Henry Hub price and impact gas production trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              These projections describe what is possible today given price,
              economics, technology, geology, and other assumptions. Actual
              production could be different given other unforeseen factors like
              demand, weather, processing plant outages, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gas production depends on price, but also on recovery technology,
              drilling efficiency and costs. Should technology or costs advance
              differently than assumed, capital expenditures and well production
              projections would be different than modelled here.

          <p>
            Canadian natural gas production from 2018 to 2040 will consist of
            conventional and tight gas production from the WCSB with
            contributions from Atlantic Canada, Ontario, coalbed methane (CBM)
            production from Alberta, and shale gas production from Alberta and
            B.C. Analysis in this report includes trends in well production
            characteristics and resource development expectations – used to
            develop parameters that define future natural gas production from
            the WCSB. Different approaches were used for other regions of Canada
            where production is sourced from a smaller number of wells.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa11">A1.1 WCSB</h3>
          <p>
            To assess gas production for the WCSB, gas production was split into
            five type categories as shown in Figure A1.1.
          </p>

          <p>
            The method to determine gas production associated with conventional
            gas wells (including tight gas), CBM wells, and shale gas wells is
            described below. Production decline analysis on historical
            production data was used to determine parameters that define future
            performance. The method to determine gas production related to oil
            wells (solution gas) is described in Section A1.1.2 of this
            appendix.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa111">A1.1.1 Groupings for Production Decline Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Different groupings by type of gas well were made to assess well
            performance characteristics. Conventional, tight, and shale gas
            wells were grouped geographically on the basis of the Petrocube
            areas in Alberta, B.C., and Saskatchewan, as shown in Figure A1.2.
            These wells were also grouped by geological zone. In this analysis,
            gas production from the Montney Formation is separate from the other
            tight gas sources.

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Within each Petrocube area and zone, gas wells were grouped by year,
            with all wells existing prior to 1999 forming a single group, and
            separate groups for each year from 1999 through 2040.
          </p>
          <p>
            CBM wells in Alberta were also grouped primarily by zone into three
            categories:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>Horseshoe Canyon Main Play</li>
            <li>Mannville CBM, and</li>
            <li>Other CBM</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Within each of the three categories of CBM resources, wells were
            also grouped by well year. For the Horseshoe Canyon Main Play and
            Other CBM categories, there is a single grouping for all wells
            existing prior to 2004, and separate groupings for each year
            thereafter. For Mannville CBM, a single grouping was made for all
            wells existing prior to 2006, and separate groupings for each
            following year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In total there are about 150 gas resource groupings representing
            western Canada, each with its own set of decline parameters for each
            year.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa112">A1.1.2 Method for Existing Wells</h3>
          <p>
            The method applied to make the gas production projections for
            existing wells differs from what is done to project production for
            future wells. For <strong>existing wells,</strong> production
            decline analysis on historical production data is done on each
            grouping (gas type/Petrocube area/geological zone and by well year)
            to develop two sets of parameters.

            <li>
              Group production parameters - describing production expectations
              for the entire gas resource grouping.
            </li>
            <li>
              Average well production parameters - describing production
              expectations for the average gas well in the grouping.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The method for the production decline analysis on existing wells is
            described below. The group production parameters and average well
            production parameters resulting from this analysis are contained in
            Appendices A.3 and A.4, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the model, the group production parameters are used to make the
            production projection for existing wells. For each of these
            groupings, a data set of group marketable production history is
            created. The data sets for group marketable production are generated
            as follows:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              Raw well production for gas connections in each grouping is summed
              by calendar month getting total group raw production by calendar
              month.
            </li>
            <li>
              The total group raw production by calendar month is multiplied by
              an average shrinkage factor that applies to the grouping and
              divided by the number of days in each month to get total monthly
              marketable gas production and marketable gas production
              rate&nbsp;(MMcf/d) for each calendar month.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using this data set, plots of total daily marketable production
              rate versus total cumulative marketable production are generated
              for each grouping.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The data sets for average well production history are created as
            follows.
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              The raw well production by month for each connection in the
              grouping is put in a data base.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each entry of production month for each well, a value of
              normalized production month is calculated as the number of months
              between the month the connection began producing and the actual
              production month (this is the normalized production month).
            </li>
            <li>
              The raw production for wells in the grouping is summed by
              normalized production month and then multiplied by the average
              shrinkage factor that applies to the grouping, providing total
              marketable production by normalized production month.
            </li>
            <li>
              The marketable production for normalized production month is then
              divided by the average number of days in a month, or 30.4375,
              giving the production rate for the average well in the grouping by
              normalized production month.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using this data set, daily marketable production rate versus
              cumulative marketable production for the average well were
              generated for each grouping.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For conventional gas wells, the following procedures are applied in
            performing production decline analysis using the group and average
            well historical production data sets:

            For the earlier well years, the available data is usually sufficient
            to establish all of the above parameters. For more recent well
            years, the duration of historical production data becomes shorter
            and the parameters describing the later life decline performance
            must be taken from that determined for earlier well years. In the
            example shown in Figure A1.3, the available data is sufficient to
            determine parameters defining the first, second, and third decline
            periods for the well, but the parameters defining the fourth decline
            period must be assumed based on the analysis of earlier well years.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is assumed that, unless the historical data for the well year
            indicates otherwise, the fourth decline rate will equal the terminal
            decline rate for the grouping established through evaluation of all
            pre &ndash; 1999 wells, and that period of the terminal decline rate
            will commence after 120 months of production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decline parameters determined in this manner for average wells
            are available in Appendix A4.

              Production Decline Analysis for the Group Data: <br />
              Once the performance parameters for the average well are
              established, the procedure focuses on evaluation of group
              performance parameters. <br />
              As a first step, the average well performance parameters are
              combined with the known 12&ndash;month well schedule to calculate
              the expected group performance. This is plotted with the actual
              group performance data. If the data calculated from average well
              performance data does not provide a good match with the actual
              historical production data for the group, then the average well
              parameters may be revised until a good match is obtained between
              calculated group production data (from average well data) and

              In the earlier well year groupings (2001, 2002, etc.), the actual
              group data is usually stabilized by the current date at or near
              the terminal decline rate established via the pre&ndash;1999
              aggregate grouping. In these cases a single decline rate
              sufficiently describes the entire remaining productive life of the
              grouping. In these cases the expected performance calculated from
              average well data has little influence over determination of the
              group parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
              In later well years (2015, 2016, etc.) actual group production
              history data cannot provide a good basis upon which to project
              future production. In these cases the expected performance
              calculated from average well data is vital to establishing the
              current and future decline rates.
            </p>

              Group performance parameters determined in this manner are
              available in Appendix A3.
            </p>
            <p>
              The production decline analysis procedure described above is also
              applied to the CBM groupings and shale gas. Mannville CBM
              connections have a different performance profile than the other
              gas resources in the WCSB. While gas wells for all other groupings
              can be described by an initial production rate that declines in a
              relatively predictable manner, Mannville CBM connections go
              through a dewatering phase with gas production increasing over a
              period of months to a peak rate. After the peak rate is reached
              decline will occur. Thus a slightly different set of parameters is
              used to describe performance of the average well for Mannville
              CBM, with initial production rate being replaced by &ldquo;Months
              to Peak Production&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peak Production Rate&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
              The shorter production history of shale gas makes it more
              difficult to establish long-term decline rates based on historical
              data. Nevertheless, decline rates that describe the full
              productive life of shale gas wells are still estimated based on
              the NEB’s view of ultimate gas recovery for the average well.

          <p>
            For future wells, production is estimated based on the number of
            projected wells and the expected average performance characteristics
            of those wells. The drilling projection is used to estimate the
            number of future gas wells. Historical trends in average well
            performance parameters, obtained from production decline analysis of
            existing gas wells, are used to estimate average well performance
            parameters for future well years.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa1131">A1.1.3.1 Performance of Future Wells</h3>
          <p>
            The performance of future wells is obtained in each grouping by
            extrapolating the production performance trends for average wells in
            past years. The performance parameters estimated are initial
            productivity of the average well and the associated decline rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many groupings there are trends of decreasing or increasing
            initial productivity for the average gas well. Figure A1.5, which
            shows the initial production rate over time for tight gas wells in
            the Alberta Deep Basin Upper Colorado grouping. The IP was trending
            down until about 2006 when horizontal drilling and multi&ndash;stage
            hydraulic fracturing technologies started taking off, which
            increased the IP over the last decade in this grouping. The initial
            production rate for future gas wells is estimated by extrapolating
            the trend in each grouping, and are adjusted if there are any other
            assumptions such as technological or resource changes. Historical
            and projected initial productivity values for the average well for
            all groupings are contained in Appendices A3 and A4.

            Figure A1.7 shows the method for projecting the number of gas wells
            for each year over the projection period. The key inputs are amount
            of re-investment of revenue and the drill day cost. Adjustments to
            these two key inputs can significantly change the drilling
            projections. The values projected for the other inputs are estimated

            The Board projects an allocation of gas drill days for each of the
            groupings. The allocation fractions are determined from historical
            trends, recent estimates of supply costs, and the Board’s view of
            development potential for the groupings. The allocation fractions
            reflect the historical trends of an increasing focus on the deeper
            formations located in the western side of the basin, increasing
            interest in tight gas and gas shales in B.C. and Alberta, and
            further development of liquids rich/wet natural gas. Tables of drill
            days by year by grouping for each case are in Appendices B1.1 to

          </p>
          <p>
            The number of gas wells drilled in each year is calculated by
            dividing the drill days targeting each resource grouping by the
            average number of days it takes to drill a well. Future drill days
            per well for each grouping are based on historical data, and any

            four future decline rates that apply to specified time periods in
            the future. For the older wells where production appears to have
            stabilized at a final decline rate, only one future decline rate is
            needed to describe future group deliverability. For newer wells, the
            decline rate that applies over future months changes as the group
            performance progresses towards the final stable decline period. For
            these newer wells, three or possibly four different decline rates
            have been determined to describe future performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The projected production from existing wells represents the
            production that would occur from the WCSB if no further gas wells
            started producing after December 2016. Production from future gas
            wells supplements the declining production from existing wells.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa212">A2.1.2 Production from Future Gas Wells</h3>
          <p>
            Production associated with future gas wells is calculated for each
            resource grouping using estimates for production performance of the
            average well and the number of wells in future years. The parameters
            associated with both of these inputs are discussed in the sections
            below.
          </p>
          <p>
            While past projections for existing gas wells have enjoyed a high
            degree of accuracy, the certainty associated with the projections
            for future gas wells is less. The key uncertainties are the level of
            gas drilling that will occur and the production levels of wells. The
            high and low price cases aim to address the uncertainty inherent in
            the gas drilling projections.

            A2.1.2.1 Performance Parameters for Future Average Gas Wells
          </h3>
          <p>
            The production decline analysis procedures described in Appendix A.1
            provide the basis for establishing performance parameters for future
            gas wells. The trends seen in average well performance for the
            various groupings of existing wells are used to make an estimate of
            performance parameters for future gas wells
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to initial productivity of the average gas well, the
            overall trend for the WCSB is shown in Figure A2.1. After decreases
            in initial productivity over 2001 to 2006, the trend reversed upward
            for 2007, remained fairly stable through 2009, and continued upward
            through to 2015 as higher initial productivity rates from tight gas
            and shale gas wells began to represent a growing share of the wells
            drilled in a year. Initial productivity over the projection is
            almost flat primarily due to holding the rates constant for most gas
            wells.

            The performance parameters projected are the same in all cases

          <p>
            The projected number of wells by year and the projected production
            performance of the average wells in those years determine projected
            production of future gas wells. To determine the number of future
            gas wells, projections of gas drilling activity by grouping are
            made.

          <p>
            Volatile and unpredictable market conditions are expected to be the
            primary influences on gas drilling activity. As a result, there is a
            high degree of uncertainty in the gas drilling activity that could
            occur over the projection period. The High Price Case and Low Price
            Case reflect a range of market conditions that may occur over the
            projection period. Figure A2.2 shows the total projected number of
            gas wells by year by case.

            Projected annual gas wells and drilling days for each grouping are

          <p>
            As indicated in Appendix A1, production from Atlantic Canada and
            Ontario is based on extrapolation of prior trends. No additional
            wells over the projection period are assumed to be drilled that
            would contribute to production at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketable production from the Deep Panuke development started in
            fall 2013. Deep Panuke has begun producing seasonally in the
            winters, however incursion of water into the reservoir could
            adversely impact the amount of natural gas recoverable over the
            lifetime of the project. In this report offshore natural gas
            production in Nova Scotia declines steadily over the projection
            period and production ceases by 2021 for both the Deep Panuke and
            Sable projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provincial policy in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia currently
            prohibits hydraulic fracturing which is required for shale gas
            development. It is assumed that these policies do not change and no
            additional onshore gas wells are drilled over the projection period.
            Ontario production continues to decline with no additional drilling
            expected over the projection period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provincial policy in Quebec currently prohibits hydraulic fracturing
            which is required for shale gas development. It is assumed that
            these policies do not change and no additional gas wells are drilled
            over the projection period.

                  The natural gas price includes an adjustment, starting in
                  2020, for methane abatement. It works out to about $0.02/mmBtu
                  for gas from gas wells and $0.09/mmBtu for solution gas from
                  oil wells.

                  Cost inflation is kept the same in all cases. Given higher or
                  lower drilling levels, drill day cost inflation could vary
                  between the cases. LNG export assumptions are the same in all
                  cases, and thus do not affect capital expenditures differently
                  between the cases.

                  The $50/tonne carbon price is equivalent to a cost of $0.22
                  per thousand cubic feet of marketable natural gas produced,
                  and the $336/tonne carbon price works out to almost $1.50 per
                  thousand cubic feet&nbsp;(Mcf). This estimate assumes an
                  average 0.05 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per Mcf of raw natural
                  gas production, 0.08 Mcf of gas use per Mcf, and 16% volume

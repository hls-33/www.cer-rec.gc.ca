          <p>
            The National Energy Board&rsquo;s (NEB) Energy Futures (EF) series
            explores how possible energy futures might unfold for Canadians over
            the long term. EF analyses consider a range of impacts across the
            entire Canadian energy system. In order to cover all aspects of
            Canadian energy in one supply and demand outlook, the extensive
            crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) production
            analyses are described at a relatively high level. A series of
            supplemental reports is able to address impacts specific to the
            supply sector, creating an opportunity to provide additional detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future oil prices are a key driver of future oil production and a
            key uncertainty to the projections in the
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2018/index-eng.html"
              >Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2018: Energy Supply and Demand
              Projections to 2040</a
            >
            (EF2018). Crude oil prices could be higher or lower depending on
            demand, technology, geopolitical events, and the pace at which
            nations enact policies to reduce GHG emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            EF analysis assumes that, over the long term, all energy produced
            will find markets. In the near-term, a lack of available pipeline
            export capacity was accounted for in the price assumptions for
            western Canadian crudes. The timing and extent to which particular
            markets emerge, whether demand growth over/undershoots local
            production, whether export/import opportunities arise, and whether
            new transportation infrastructure is built, are difficult to
            predict. This is why simplifying assumptions are made. The analysis

            these short-term disconnects are resolved over the longer term.

            Alberta&rsquo;s oil sands will be responsible for the majority of
            crude oil production in Canada through 2040 in all four cases,
            mainly because of growing in situ production. This supplemental
            report provides additional analysis and results of EF2018&rsquo;s
            four cases. Differences in production forecasts between the cases
            are because of different oil price assumptions and new technologies
            used for in situ development in the Technology Case.

              This graph presents raw bitumen production for the Reference Case
              in each of the three oil sands areas, Athabasca, Cold Lake and
              Peace River. The Athabasca region continues to be the largest
              contributor to total oil sands output, reaching 4.0&nbsp;MMb/d, or
              89%, by 2040. Cold Lake continues to increase production over the
              projection period reaching 0.45&nbsp;MMb/d, or 10%, by 2040 while
              Peace River production falls to 0.04&nbsp;MMb/d, or 1.0%, by 2040.

              Oil sands production has increased in recent years. This is
              largely because projects that started construction prior to
              mid-2014&rsquo;s crude-oil price collapse have been completed and
              came online. This trend will continue into the early 2020s, after
              which production will grow more slowly. In 2017,
              <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#W">WTI</a> oil prices averaged
              US$50.80 per barrel which, when netted back to western Canada, was
              high enough to cover operating costs of existing projects and spur
              investment in some new projects. As WTI prices rise, reaching
              US$71.50 per barrel by 2027, additional investment in the oil
              sands occurs. This leads to higher growth rates in the second half
              of the next decade. Oil sands production in 2017 was just over
              2.8&nbsp;million barrels per day (MMb/d) and will reach just under
              4.5&nbsp;MMb/d in 2040, a 58% increase.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              The Athabasca region produces the majority of oil sands raw
              bitumen, both historically and throughout the projections (Figure
              2.1).  Averaging 2.4&nbsp;MMb/d in 2017, the Athabasca region
              produced 85% of all raw bitumen, with Cold Lake and Peace River
              producing 13% per cent and 1% respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most of the mined bitumen as well as some in situ production is
              upgraded in Alberta into synthetic crude oil. There are
              exceptions, however. Fort Hills—which came online in late 2017—and
              Kearl both produce diluted bitumen, which is transported to
              markets by pipeline or rail. <br />

              This graph shows the proportion of raw bitumen production
              attributable to each of four main extraction methods: Mining;
              Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD); Cyclic Steam Stimulation
              (CSS); and Mining and Primary/Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).
              Production from both SAGD and CSS continue to grow reaching
              2.6&nbsp;MMb/d by 2040 while primary and EOR production increases
              early in the projection to 0.30 MMb/d by 2025 before declining to
              0.23&nbsp;MMb/d by 2040. Mined production reaches 1.6&nbsp;MMb/d
              in 2022 and remains relatively stable for the remainder of the

                  In situ, which primarily uses steam to heat the reservoir,
                  allowing the bitumen to be pumped to the surface through

                  >. In the future, injecting solvents with steam or instead of
                  steam are expected to play an increasingly important role in
                  in situ production.

                <li>
                  Primary production and enhanced oil production (EOR), which
                  produces the bitumen like conventional oil wells and requires
                  no steam.

            <li>
              Mining is currently used to develop oil sands deposits up to a
              depth of about 70 meters. Most historical development of the oil
              sands has been through mining. However, only about 20% of oil
              sands deposits can be accessed this way.
            </li>
            <li>
              The remaining 80% of oil sands deposits can only be developed with
              in situ technology. In 2012, in situ production surpassed mining
              production and is now the largest source of crude oil in Canada.
              In situ production is expected to continue growing faster than
              mining production and will account for 58% of all raw bitumen
              production by 2040.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure 2.2 shows mining production will plateau after new and
              expansion projects currently being developed are ramped up to full
              production, which is typically 90% of nameplate capacity. Only
              relatively small additions to mining are expected to come online
              thereafter, entirely through expansions to existing facilities.
              Mined production reaches 1.65&nbsp;MMb/d in 2022 and remains
              relatively stable for the remainder of the projection. Typically,
              producers develop the best area of their land first, then step
              into lower quality areas as the operation matures. This projection
              assumes processes and technology will continue to improve to
              offset declines in bitumen production from developing lower
              quality reservoir, keeping mined production relatively stable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Costs to operate or expand existing in situ facilities, as well as
              build new in situ facilities, are expected to continue improving.
              This leads to growing in situ production from both SAGD and CSS,
              reaching 2.58&nbsp;MMb/d by 2040.

            <li>
              Primary and EOR production remains relatively stable throughout
              the forecast, peaking in 2025 at 0.24&nbsp;MMb/d before declining

              This graph shows production of raw bitumen by existing, expansion
              and entirely new or greenfield projects for the projection period.
              Production from existing projects increases slightly over the
              projection period because of process and technology improvements
              and the ramp-up in production from projects that have yet to reach
              full capacity, reaching 3.2&nbsp;MMb/d by 2040. Expansions will
              account for 17% or 0.8&nbsp;MMb/d by 2040 while 0.5&nbsp;MMb/d or
              10% of total production will come from greenfield projects.

              Because bitumen projection from mining and in situ projects does
              not decline like production from conventional oil wells, bitumen
              production currently online will remain steady over the projection

              Production averaged just over 2.8&nbsp;MMb/d from mining, in situ,
              and primary/EOR combined in 2017. Figure 2.3 shows current
              projects slightly increase their production over the projection
              period because of process, improvements, technology improvements,
              and projects not yet at full capacity ramping up their production.
              Total production from current projects reaches 3.24&nbsp;MMb/d by

            <li>
              The largest contributor to oil sands production growth will be
              expansions to existing in situ facilities. At 0.78&nbsp;MMb/d,
              expansions will produce 64% of new production by 2040.
            </li>
            <li>
              Entirely new projects (i.e. greenfield projects) will produce the
              remaining 36% of new production and will produce 0.45&nbsp;MMb/d
              by 2040. This relatively small share is because greenfield
              projects are typically more expensive to build than expansions.

              This graph shows diluent requirements for oil sands and heavy oil.
              Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are the most widely used diluent and
              grow from 0.6&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017 to 1.01&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040.
              Synthetic crude oil is also used as a diluent, though less so.
              Synthetic crude oil as a diluent remains stable at 0.09&nbsp;Mb/d.
            </p>

              With few exceptions, bitumen must be blended with a lighter
              hydrocarbon (i.e., diluent) so it can flow within pipelines or be
              carried on train cars. The most common form of diluent is Natural
              Gas Liquids (NGL), though synthetic crude oil and other light oils
              are also used.
            </li>
            <li>
              The amount of diluent required to blend bitumen varies depending
              on the type of diluent and the mode of transportation. Typically,
              bitumen blended with NGLs for shipping in pipelines requires
              roughly 1 barrel of NGL for every 3 barrels of diluted bitumen, or
              a 30% blend ratio. If the diluent is synthetic crude oil, then
              more diluent is required, about 1 barrel for every 2 barrels of
              diluted bitumen. However, relatively few oil sands operations use
              synthetic crude oil or other light oils as diluent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure 2.5 shows the amount of diluent the oil sands will require
              over the projection period. Synthetic crude oil is increasingly
              used as a diluent early in the projection, reaching
              0.10&nbsp;MMb/d in 2019 before flattening. NGL use as a diluent,
              however, grows considerably over the projection, jumping 72% to
              reach 1.01&nbsp;MMb/d by 2040

              The graph shows the variety of results in production from all four
              EF2018 cases. In order of volume of raw bitumen production in
              2040, the results of the analysis are as follows: 2.8&nbsp;MMb/d
              in the Low Price Case, 4.1&nbsp;MMb/d in the Technology Case,
              4.5&nbsp;MMb/d in the Reference Case and, 5.4&nbsp;MMb/d in the
              High Price Case.

            <li>
              To capture the uncertainty in projecting oil production until
              2040, a wide range of future prices were assumed. WTI prices reach
              US$116.50 per barrel in the High Price Case and decline to
              US$36.50 in the Low Price Case. In 2040, bitumen production would
              be 5.37&nbsp;MMb/d in the High Case and 2.77&nbsp;MMb/d in the Low
              Case (Figure 3.1).

            <li>
              Similar to last year&rsquo;s Technology Cases, this year&rsquo;s
              Technology Case assumes steam solvent technologies are more
              quickly adopted in the oil sands. Other innovations, such as wedge
              wells<sup id="fn1-rf"

              projection. In this case, these technologies lower overall GHG
              emissions intensity from the oil sands while increasing production
              of many facilities at the same time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure 3.1 shows how widespread adoption of these technologies
              affects production. Production in the Technology Case grows
              quicker than the Reference Case early in the projection, reaching
              4.20&nbsp;MMb/d by 2033 before falling slightly to 4.13&nbsp;MMb/d
              by 2040. The early peak and subsequent fall of production in this
              case is because lower price assumptions, coupled with increased
              carbon pricing, eventually completely offset the early production
              increase brought on by technology improvements.

            <li>
              Future oil prices are a key driver of future oil production and a
              key uncertainty to the projections in EF2018. Crude oil prices
              could be higher or lower depending on demand trends, technological
              developments, geopolitical events, and the pace at which nations
              enact policies to reduce GHG emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              This analysis assumes that, over the long term, all energy
              production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as
              needed. In the near-term however, a lack of available pipeline
              capacity impacts pricing of Canadian crude oil and the economics
              of production.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Technology Case assumes global crude oil prices are lower than
              in the Reference Case. Future prices in a GHG-constrained world
              are uncertain and depend on how robust concerted global climate
              action is, how oil demand responds to higher carbon prices, and
              alternatives to existing technology.
            </li>
            <li>
              Efforts to increase efficiency and decrease costs and
              environmental footprint in the oil sands are another key
              uncertainty in EF2018&rsquo;s projections. Should technology
              advance at a different pace than assumed, then projections of
              bitumen production would change accordingly.

          <h3 id="sa">Projecting Oil Sands Production: Methods</h3>
          <p>
            Oil sands production is projected by applying utilization rates to
            the capacities of existing oil sands projects and the timelines of
            new projects and expansion phases expected to be built in the
            future. Projections do not consider changes to production as a
            result of weather, equipment failure, or other potential
            interruptions. Raw bitumen production and synthetic crude oil
            production are projected for each case.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main differences between the cases are oil prices, carbon taxes,
            and technology assumptions. Varying oil prices affect industry
            revenues, and the reinvestment of a portion of the revenue as
            capital expenditures. Varying carbon taxes affect the net revenue
            available. The higher the carbon taxes, the higher the cost of
            production and the lower the net revenue. Technological advancements
            affect both bitumen production, as well as the steam to oil ratio
            (SOR). These variations do not affect all oil sands projects
            uniformly. For instance, the better a project&rsquo;s SOR, the less
            impact rising carbon taxes have. This results in an emissions credit
            for some projects in some years. More details about how emissions
            are calculated are provided in Section A4.4.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mining and in situ production are estimated using the same method.
            Projects are assessed based on their announced capacities and start
            dates and then risked in terms of start time. Production from all
            projects of each type (i.e. mining, in situ) is then aggregated.
            Production from projects that are currently operating is held
            relatively constant for the majority of the projection. In some
            cases, depending on the age of the facility, production is decreased
            towards the end of the projection period. Increases in production
            for any given project are largely the result of new phases coming
            online and, to a lesser extent, process improvements in the early
            years of that project or phase. These methods significantly differ
            from conventional oil projections, which are well-based and use
            decline-curve analysis.

          <p>
            Both raw bitumen production and synthetic crude oil production are
            projected as part of the analysis. The majority of mined bitumen is
            upgraded within Alberta with some notable exceptions. In addition,
            production from two in situ facilities, Suncor&rsquo;s Firebag and

            A.1.3 Type of Recovery – In Situ, Mining, Primary, EOR
          </h3>
          <p>
            Bitumen is produced in one of four ways. Roughly 90% is either mined
            or extracted using in situ methods. Remaining production comes from
            Primary and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Primary bitumen production
            is slightly less viscous than in situ bitumen and can flow to the
            surface without applying heat or solvents. However, these projects
            are of a smaller scale than in situ developments. EOR uses reservoir
            flooding similar to the technology used for conventional oil. These
            too are smaller scale than either mining or in situ projects.
            Combined, there were over 150 Primary and EOR projects operating
            within Alberta in 2017.
          </p>

          <h3 id="sa14">A.1.4 In Situ Recovery Method – SAGD, CSS, EOR</h3>
          <p>
            There are three types of in situ recovery technologies included in
            this report: SAGD, CSS, and EOR.
          </p>
          <p>
            SAGD typically uses pairs of horizontal wells to produce bitumen.
            Steam is injected into an upper well to heat the bitumen, which then
            drains by gravity into a lower well and is pumped to the surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS also uses steam to produce bitumen. The steam is injected into a
            reservoir through a well over a period of several months, heating
            and decreasing the bitumen&rsquo;s viscosity. Later, the steam is
            turned off and the emulsion of water and bitumen flows back into the
            well over a period of several months. The process is repeated for
            the economic life of the well.
          </p>
          <p>
            EOR extracts oil from reservoirs once pressures have fallen to a
            point where natural production is no longer economically viable,
            even with artificial lifts like pump jacks. This includes pressure
            maintenance, cycling, water flooding, thermal methods, chemical
            flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement
            fluids.
          </p>

          <h3 id="sa2">A.2 Methods to Project Bitumen Production</h3>
          <p>
            For this report, historical production data, plans announced by
            producers, and industry and government consultations were used to
            derive projections. Monthly projections out to the end of 2040 are
            made for existing projects, for future (new) projects, and for
            expansions of both existing and new projects.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa21">A.2.1 Method for Existing Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Projects that are, or have, produced are categorized as existing
            projects and their historical monthly production trend is used to
            project future production. For the most part, existing
            projects&rsquo; production is held constant out to 2040. Projections
            for projects whose production is currently declining maintain that
            decline. Projects whose production is currently zero but produced in
            the past will either have zero production over the projections
            (retired projects) or return to the expected levels at a given time
            based on publicly available information (i.e., projects that have
            been temporarily shut down).
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa22">A.2.2 Method for Expansions</h3>
          <p>
            Expansions are additions to existing projects. Given the oil price
            assumptions, most future increases in bitumen production will come
            from expansions of existing projects rather than new projects.
            Publically available information is used to determine the size and
            timing of expansions.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa23">A.2.3 Method for Future Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Given a projected oil price and other assumptions, it may be
            warranted to include one or more new projects in the projection. New
            in situ projects are expected to be built as well though the timing,
            size and number of projects differs between the cases.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa3">
            A.3 Synthetic Crude Oil Production Projection Methods
          </h3>
          <p>
            Synthetic crude oil is raw bitumen that is processed into a lighter
            crude oil. Most mined bitumen is currently upgraded and it is
            assumed this trend will continue throughout the projection period.
            In addition to mining, some in situ and heavy oil production is
            upgraded.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa4">A.4 Diluent Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Diluent requirements are estimated by taking into account the annual
            average blending ratios for each individual oil sands project. This
            ratio varies by type of heavy crude oil being blended and the type
            of diluent being used. The volume of diluent required to blend
            conventional heavy oil (i.e. all heavy oil not produced by the oil
            sands) is also included in this analysis.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa5">A.5 Other Assumptions and Analysis</h3>
          <h3 id="sa51">A.5.1 CO<sub>2</sub> Assumptions</h3>
          <p>
            The cost of carbon dioxide emissions are included in the analysis.
            The cost of emissions decreases industry revenue and cash flow
            available for future capital expenditures. However, on a project by
            project basis, the cost of carbon may or may not affect the
            production projection. More efficient projects with lower SORs
            won&rsquo;t have their economics affected as much as less efficient
            projects. Thus, for most projects, given current and projected SORs,
            the production projection is the same
            <sup id="fn3-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"
                ><span class="wb-inv">Note de bas de page </span>3</a
              ></sup
            >
            for varying carbon prices. Less efficient, usually smaller, projects
            are assumed to be affected with some production taken out of the
            projection given the carbon and oil price assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of gas consumed, and CO<sub>2</sub> emitted, can be
            calculated using the gas use per barrel of bitumen or synthetic oil
            discussed in section A.4.2. The assumed ratio is:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>
              <p>
                0.0019 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> / m<sup>3</sup> of natural gas
                use
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An output-based adjustment, as based on Alberta&rsquo;s climate
            plan, was then applied to the actual cost of CO<sub>2</sub>, for
            each project by year. For a given year, the projects are ranked from
            lowest SOR to highest SOR. The 25<sup>th</sup> percentile lowest SOR
            is a threshold level. The carbon cost associated with that SOR is
            the output-based adjustment and all projects&rsquo; carbon costs are
            adjusted by that amount. Thus, the projects with lower SORs than the
            threshold end up with a carbon cost less than zero (revenue is
            adjusted up) and the rest of the projects have lower, but still
            positive carbon costs (revenue is adjusted lower). More information
            on carbon calculations and provincial policies can be found in the

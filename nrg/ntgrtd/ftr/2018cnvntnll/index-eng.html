          <p>
            The National Energy Board&rsquo;s (NEB) Energy Futures (EF) series
            explores how possible energy futures might unfold for Canadians over
            the long term. EF analyses consider a range of impacts across the
            entire Canadian energy system. In order to cover all aspects of
            Canadian energy in one supply and demand outlook, the extensive
            crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) production
            analyses are described at a relatively high level. A series of
            supplemental reports is able to address impacts specific to the
            supply sector, creating an opportunity to provide additional detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future oil prices are a key driver of future oil production and a
            key uncertainty to the projections in the
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2018/index-eng.html"
              >Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2018: Energy Supply and Demand
              Projections to 2040</a
            >
            (EF2018). Crude oil prices could be higher or lower depending on
            demand, technology, geopolitical events, and the pace at which
            nations enact policies to reduce GHG emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            EF analysis assumes that, over the long term, all energy produced
            will find markets. In the near&ndash;term, a lack of available
            pipeline export capacity was accounted for in the price assumptions
            for western Canadian crudes. The timing and extent to which
            particular markets emerge, whether demand growth over/undershoots
            local production, whether export/import opportunities arise, and
            whether new transportation infrastructure is built, is difficult to
            predict. This is why simplified assumptions are made. The analysis
            in this supplemental report continues the EF tradition of assuming
            these short&ndash;term disconnects are resolved over the longer
            term.

              years compared to 2010 to 2014. This has lead to a decline in

              gradually increase and reach US$75/bbl in 2027 for West Texas

              to outpace declining production from existing wells. Production in

              This graph breaks down the Reference Case projection for Canadian
              conventional, tight, and shale oil production by province, and
              also includes the WTI crude oil price. British Columbia oil
              production is projected to decrease from 21.07&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017
              to 19.22&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Alberta production is projected to
              increase from 443.55&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017693.69&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040.
              Saskatchewan is projected to increase from 486.73&nbsp;Mb/d in
              2017 to 719.69&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Manitoba is projected to
              decrease from 36.67&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017 to 18.15&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040.
              Newfoundland is projected to decrease from 220.75&nbsp;Mb/d in
              2017 to 106.87&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Production for the rest of
              Canada is projected to change from 9.96&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016 and
              0.93&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017 to 4.72&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Total Canadian
              production is projected to increase from 1209.71&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017
              to 1562.35&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. The WTI crude oil price, in 2016
              U.S. dollars per barrel, is projected to increase from $50.80 in
              2017 to $71.50 in 2027 and remain at $71.50 to the end of 2040.

              2016 was the first year that Saskatchewan production surpassed
              Alberta non&ndash;oil sands production. This continues over the
              projection period and, by 2040, Saskatchewan makes up 50% of total
              western Canadian production. Saskatchewan production growth
              largely comes from thermal heavy oil projects (section 2.3
              provides more details).<br />

            <li>
              British Columbia (B.C.) and Manitoba produce minor amounts of both
              conventional and tight oil. The provincial breakdowns are in the
              next section.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conventional oil is produced elsewhere in Canada. Newfoundland and
              Labrador offshore oil production increases steadily over the next
              five years as the Hebron project begins production and additional
              wells are brought online at existing facilities. After peaking at
              49 10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (310&nbsp;Mb/d) by 2023, production begins to
              decline as operating fields mature. The Reference Case assumes
              that two generic offshore discoveries add new production starting
              in 2028 and 2034. Northern Canada and Ontario oil production
              continues to trend down over the projection period. Nova Scotia
              condensate production ends in 2020 in this report, as the existing
              offshore production platforms are decommissioned.

              to climb to 58% in 2023 with the ramp&ndash;up of Saskatchewan
              thermal heavy oil projects. Heavy oil production then drops down
              to 53% by 2040 as production from those projects level off and
              growth in light oil outpaces growth in heavy oil. Both heavy and

              Northeastern B.C. production is all light oil, with conventional
              oil making up the majority. While B.C. has substantial shares of
              Canadian natural gas production and resources (see
              <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2018ntrlgs/index-eng.html"

            <li>
              The majority of non&ndash;oil sands production in Alberta has and
              will continue to be light oil. Most of the production growth over
              the projection period is from west&ndash;central parts of the
              province. As horizontal drilling and

                >multi&ndash;stage hydraulic fracturing</a
              >
              advanced over the last decade, tight oil production increased and
              will continue to make up a larger share. In 2017, conventional oil
              made up 67% of non&ndash;oil sands production in Alberta. By 2040
              that share drops to 54%, with tight oil&rsquo;s share increasing
              to 46%.

            <li>
              Heavy, conventional oil makes up the majority of Saskatchewan
              production and grows substantially over the projection period,
              given projected thermal heavy oil growth (see section 2.3). Tight
              oil production will also continue in Saskatchewan because of tight
              oil development in the southwest and southeast parts of the
              province.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manitoba production is entirely light oil. Manitoba light, tight
              oil production peaked in 2012 and 2013, and has since declined.
              However, it will increase slightly later in the projection period
              as prices rise and stay high enough for new production to outpace
              production declines from existing wells. Conventional oil
              production will decline over the projection period.

                >steam assisted gravity drainage recovery</a

              (SAGD) to heavy oil fields. There are currently 15 thermal heavy
              oil projects operating in Saskatchewan, a nearly threefold
              increase from 2012. Similar to the oil sands, production from
              these thermal projects does not exhibit the steep decline rates
              typical of traditional heavy oil wells. This generates revenues
              that enable ongoing capital expenditures and continued production
              growth over the projection period. Changes in market conditions,
              technology, or other factors could lead to production varying from
              this projection, especially for the later years.

            <li>
              Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods have long been used in
              Saskatchewan for secondary extraction. Production from existing
              projects, such as the CO<sub>2</sub> EOR projects currently
              operating in Weyburn and Midale, are starting to slowly taper off.
              This trend is expected to continue over the projection period.

              This graph shows the Reference Case production projection for
              Thermal and EOR in Saskatchewan and the Zama region of Alberta.
              Growth from this sector is largely due to increases in thermal oil
              production due to the application of SAGD technologies to
              conventional heavy oil reservoirs in the Lloydminster area of
              Saskatchewan. Thermal Saskatchewan production increases from
              28.55&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017 to 106.32&nbsp;Mb/d in 2025 and stays
              level afterwards. Midale production decreases from 1.35&nbsp;Mb/d
              in 2017 to 0.88&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Weyburn production decreases
              from 9.20&nbsp;Mb/d in 2017 to 4.51&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Zama, in

              in western Canada has, for the most part, increased until
              recently. More complex well completions and additional drilling
              days increases the cost of the well. In 2006, it took an average
              of 6.9 days to drill and complete a well. This duration increased
              over the next few years, ranging from 8 to 10 days/well from 2011
              to 2015. By 2017, the average decreased to 7.4 drill days per well
              for a number of reasons. Wells for thermal heavy oil projects in
              Saskatchewan typically take only a few days to drill. Also,
              drillers grew more efficient. The projected days per well stays
              fairly level over the projection period, where more thermal heavy
              oil development in Saskatchewan balances out with more
              conventional and tight drilling as oil price rises.<sup

              Greater focus on developing tight oil has also increased the
              average initial production (IP) rate of wells in western Canada.
              The average IP was the lowest in 2007 at 40&nbsp;bbl/d as many
              shallow, vertical wells were being drilled, which generally
              produce less oil than deeper wells. The average IP for all wells
              drilled in western Canada increased to 66&nbsp;bbl/d by 2014. The
              average IP in 2017 was 64&nbsp;bbl/d and rises early in the

          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              Production varies between the cases, especially for the High and
              Low Price cases. All cases have the same trend of focusing on
              tight oil resources and thermal heavy oil projects in
              Saskatchewan.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the Reference and High Price cases, production increases over
              the projection period. Production in the Low Price and Technology
              cases declines over the projection in the long term. In these two
              declining cases, oil prices are not high enough to enable
              sufficient revenues to fund capital expenditures to drill enough
              new wells to outpace production declines from older wells, and
              total production declines. In the Low Price Case, production drops
              to 85&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (0.5&nbsp;MMb/d) in 2040—a third of
              the production rate in the Reference Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              Production in the High Price Case reaches
              416&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (2.6&nbsp;MMb/d) in 2040—twice as much
              as the Reference Case. This is largely from a compounding effect
              over the duration of the projection, where higher prices generate
              more revenue to enable more drilling and more production.<sup

              Projected production from thermal projects in Saskatchewan is also
              higher than in the Reference Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the Technology Case, higher carbon costs and lower crude oil
              prices result in conventional production falling in the long term,
              though not as much as in the Low Price Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offshore production in the Reference Case increases in the near
              term as Hebron continues to ramp up heavy oil production and new
              wells from existing facilities are brought online. Production
              peaks at 49&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (309&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2023 and
              declines through the projection thereafter, reaching
              17&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (107&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2040. A new offshore
              discovery is assumed to add production in 2028, with a second new
              discovery in 2034. In the High Price Case new offshore production
              facilities are assumed to be constructed, supported by the
              increased price of crude oil. There are five fields of various
              sizes, two in the 2020s and three in the 2030s. Production in the
              High Price Case peaks at 57&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (358&nbsp;Mb/d)
              in 2024 and falls steadily thereafter reaching 21
              10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (129&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2040. In the Low Price Case
              there are no new discoveries assumed and production reaches a high
              of 47&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (296&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2023 and falls to
              7&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (56&nbsp;Mb/d) by 2040.

              Oil prices are a key driver of future oil production and a key
              uncertainty to the projections in EF2018. Crude oil prices could
              be higher or lower depending on demand trends, technological
              developments, geopolitical events, and the pace at which nations
              enact policies to reduce GHG emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              This analysis assumes that, over the long term, all energy
              production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as
              needed. However, in the near&ndash;term, a lack of available
              pipeline capacity impacts pricing of Canadian crude oil and the
              economics of production.
            </li>
            <li>
              The higher carbon price in the Technology Case assumes that global
              crude oil prices are lower than the Reference Case. This outcome
              is uncertain and depends on coordinated global climate action, the
              responsiveness of oil demand to higher carbon costs, and the
              availability of alternatives to existing technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oil production depends on price, but also on recovery technology
              and drilling efficiency and costs. Should technology or costs
              advance differently than assumed, capital expenditures and well
              production projections would be different than modelled here.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thermal recovery of Saskatchewan&rsquo;s heavy oil resources is a
              recent trend and future production growth is uncertain. Other
              technologies may also be adopted.

          <h3 id="sa1">Appendix A1 &ndash; METHODS (DETAILED DESCRIPTION)</h3>
          <p>
            An oil production projection is the future production capability
            from a group of wells as determined by the production
            characteristics of each well, not accounting for reductions in
            actual production due to weather conditions, low oil prices,
            equipment failure, or other potential production interruptions. It
            equals the production capability of a well, multiplied by the
            expected number of wells. The oil price outlook applied to overall
            production provides the revenue available to the industry. The
            reinvestment of a portion of the revenue as capital expenditures
            enables the industry to drill new wells. The capital expenditures,
            divided by the daily cost of drilling, provides the number of drill
            days available in a year. The number of new wells drilled in each
            year is equal to the number of drill days per year, divided by the
            number of days required to drill and complete an average well. The
            projected production performance of an average well is based on
            historical performance, specifically on how the initial production
            (IP) rates and decline rates change over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this analysis, western Canada is disaggregated into groupings
            based on geography and stratigraphy. The number of producing wells
            and well performance, both historical and projected, are analysed
            for each grouping. The production projections for all groupings are
            then summed to determine total western Canadian production. Details
            on how western Canada is disaggregated into groupings are in
            Appendix A1.1. The methods used to determine well performance are
            discussed in Appendix A1.2. The results for each grouping, including
            IP rates and decline parameters, are in

          <p>
            To assess oil deliverability for western Canada, oil production and
            wells are split into various categories as shown in Figure A1.2.
            Splitting out western Canada by area, class, type, and grouped
            geological formations resulted in 250 total groupings, which are
            listed in Appendix A3.2. Of the 250 groupings, approximately 150
            have, or have had, producing wells and thus historical production.
            The remaining groupings are placeholders for potential future
            development.

          <h3 id="sa112">A1.1.2 Class Light or Heavy</h3>
          <p>
            Each provincial regulator has its own criteria for classifying crude
            oil as light, heavy, extra&ndash;heavy, or medium. For this report,
            consistent with NEB practice, oil production has been categorized
            into only two classes: light and heavy.
          </p>
          <p>
            B.C. and Alberta oil production with a density of less than
            900&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; (25.6&nbsp;API<sup id="fn12-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"
                ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a
              ></sup
            >) is classified as light, and oil with a density of more than
            900&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; is classified as heavy. If the density
            information is missing for a well, it is classified based on other
            wells in the same pool. Based on the well data, all oil produced in
            B.C. has, and will be, light oil.
          </p>
          <p>
            The classification of Saskatchewan oil wells is based on their oil
            density and geographic area. Lloydminster wells have historically
            been classified by the Saskatchewan regulator as heavy when their
            oil production has a density greater than 945&nbsp;kg/m&sup3;
            (18.1&nbsp;API). Light oil in the Kindersley area has a density
            ranging between 840 and 875&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; (36.8 and 30.1&nbsp;API)
            while heavy oil in this area ranges between 949 and
            996&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; (17.5 and 10.4&nbsp;API). Swift Current area
            wells with oil production densities ranging between 885 and
            997&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; (28.2 and 10.3&nbsp;API), are classified as
            medium by the provincial regulator, but for this report they are
            classified as heavy for greater consistency with the categories of
            other provinces. Oil wells in the Estevan/Weyburn area that are
            classified as light by the provincial regulator were also classified
            as light in this report, and have oil densities ranging from 760 to
            896&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; (54.5 and 26.3&nbsp;API). Estevan/Weyburn wells
            classified as medium by the provincial regulator are classified in
            this report as heavy if the well is a conventional oil well and
            light if the well is a tight oil well, because crude oil developed
            like tight oil in Saskatchewan tends to be on the much lighter side
            of medium (see section A1.1.2 for information on well types).
            Historically, these wells have had oil densities ranging from 827 to
            956&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; (39.4 to 16.4&nbsp;API). Wells with missing
            classification or density information are classified as light or
            heavy based on the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            All oil wells in Manitoba are classified as light. Oil densities in
            Manitoba have ranged between 838 and 903&nbsp;kg/m&sup3; (37.2 and
            25.0&nbsp;API).
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa113">A1.1.3 Type Conventional, Tight or Shale</h3>
          <p>
            Once an oil well is classified as light or heavy, it is further
            categorized as either conventional, tight, or shale.
          </p>
          <p>
            An oil well is classified as tight if it is a horizontal well that
            produces from the following formations and was drilled after a
            certain date:

          <p>
            An oil well is considered shale oil if it is horizontal, drilled

          <h3 id="sa114">A1.1.4 Zone Formation Groups</h3>
          <p>
            There are thousands of stratigraphic horizons identified in the well
            data from the WCSB. This report aggregates these horizons into
            broader geologic zones, or groupings of formations. The geologic
            zones are:
          </p>
          <p>
            Tertiary<br />
            Upper Cretaceous<br />
            Upper Colorado<br />
            Colorado<br />
            Upper Mannville<br />
            Middle Mannville<br />
            Lower Mannville<br />
            Jurassic<br />
            Upper Triassic<br />
            Lower Triassic<br />
            Permian<br />
            Mississippian<br />
            Upper Devonian<br />
            Middle Devonian<br />
            Lower Devonian<br />
            Siluro/Ordivician<br />
            Cambrian<br />
            PreCambrian
          </p>
          <p>
            These geologic zones may be further aggregated into groupings of
            particular formations, based on criteria such as the area, similar
            well characteristics, or number of wells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within each grouping, oil wells were grouped by well year, with all
            wells drilled prior to 1999 forming a single group and separate
            yearly classifications for each year from 1999 and on. Thus, for
            each grouping, average well performance can by analysed over time to
            see how IP rates and declines change as the resource is developed
            and as technology evolves.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa115">A1.1.5 Enhanced Oil Recovery Projects</h3>
          <p>
            There are at least ten thermal projects in Saskatchewan in Area 12,
            two CO<sub>2</sub>&ndash;EOR projects in Area 14 in Saskatchewan and
            one in Area 10 in northwest Alberta. Each of these projects are
            identified as separate groupings in the analysis. Since these
            methods of oil extraction are more
            &lsquo;project&ndash;based&rsquo;, wells that are identified as part
            of these projects are not included in the overall decline analysis.
            Instead, oil production projections for these projects are based on
            recent production trends as well as producer plans for continued
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of the thermal projects produces heavy, conventional oil from
            the Mannville Group. The thermal projects are:
          </p>
          <p>
            Senlac<br />
            Onion Lake<br />
            Celtic GP/Sparky<br />
            Rush Lake<br />
            Lashburn<br />
            Pikes Peak<br />
            Pikes Peak South<br />
            Plover Lake<br />
            Sandall<br />
            Bolney/Celtic
          </p>
          <p>
            The CO<sub>2</sub>&ndash;EOR projects in Saskatchewan produce heavy,
            conventional oil from the Mississippian zone. The Alberta project
            produces light, conventional oil from the Mississippian and Devonian
            zones. The Saskatchewan and Alberta CO<sub>2</sub>&ndash;EOR
            projects are:
          </p>
          <p>
            Weyburn (Area 14)<br />
            Midale (Area 14)<br />
            Zama (Area 10)
          </p>
          <p>
            There are other existing and potential EOR projects in western
            Canada that may be analysed as individual groupings in future
            editions of this report.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa116">A1.1.6 Oil Production from Gas Wells</h3>
          <p>
            Oil production from natural gas wells is minimal. In Alberta, less
            than two per cent of conventional and tight oil production comes
            from gas wells. Since all wells producing oil are included in the
            existing well analysis, projected oil production from gas wells is
            embedded in the group projections. Oil production from future gas
            wells is not directly projected. Analysis of condensate production
            is included in a separate analysis in the
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2018ntrlgslqds/index-eng.html"

          <h3 id="sa12">A1.2 Oil Well Performance Methods</h3>
          <p>
            For this report, historical production data was analysed to
            determine production declines which were then used to determine
            future performance. In some cases, historical data of newer tight
            and shale oil development is more limited and production decline
            trends are not as established. Information gathered during
            consultations with industry, when possible, and from publicly
            available data played a larger role in establishing expected well
            performance for these newer tight and shale oil groupings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The analysis includes wells drilled since 2000, which creates a
            large dataset of historical well production trends. The methods
            applied to project oil production for existing wells differ from
            those used to project oil production for future wells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historical production data is analysed to determine production
            declines for each grouping (oil area/class/type/zone/well year) to
            develop two sets of parameters:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              Group decline parameters – describing production expectations for
              the entire oil grouping.
            </li>
            <li>
              Average well decline parameters – describing production
              expectations for the average oil well in the grouping for each
              year.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The group decline parameters and average well decline parameters
            resulting from this analysis are contained in Appendices A3.3, A4.1,

            Oil wells are grouped by area, class, type, geological zone, and
            well year. For each of these groupings, a data set of oil production
            history is created and a data set of average well production history
            is also generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data sets used to estimate group decline parameters are
            generated by the following: Oil production in each grouping is
            summed to estimate total group oil production &nbsp;(bbl/d) by
            calendar month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using this data set, plots of the total daily oil production rate
            versus total cumulative oil production are generated for each
            grouping.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data sets used to determine average well decline parameters are
            generated by the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              The historical, monthly oil production for each well in the
              grouping is put in a database.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each well, the production months are normalized such that the
              month the well started producing becomes the first production
              month.
            </li>
            <li>
              The total oil production by normalized production month is then
              divided by the total number of wells in the grouping to determine
              normalized, monthly oil production for the average well.
            </li>
            <li>
              The normalized, monthly oil production is then divided by the
              average number of days in a month, or 30.4375, to determine the
              daily production rates for the average well in the grouping.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using this data set, plots of the daily oil production rate versus
              cumulative oil production for the average well are generated for
              each grouping.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After the average well&rsquo;s historical production for each
            grouping and year is determined, each average well is evaluated in
            sequence, from 2000 through 2016.

                &ldquo;Older&rdquo; average wells usually have sufficient data
                to establish all of the above parameters. However,
                &ldquo;younger&rdquo; average wells have historical production
                data of shorter duration. Therefore, the projected
                long&ndash;term performance of a &ldquo;younger&rdquo; average
                well is assumed to be similar to the historical long&ndash;term
                performance of an &ldquo;older&ldquo; average well. In Figure
                A1.4, the available data is sufficient to determine parameters
                defining the first, second, third, and fourth decline periods
                for the well, but the parameters defining the fifth decline

            In this report, &ldquo;existing wells&rdquo; are those brought on
            production prior to 1 January 2017. Group decline parameters are
            used to project oil production for existing wells.
          </p>
          <p>
            In groupings of older wells (2001, 2002, etc.), actual group
            production from recent years is usually stabilized or is near the
            terminal decline rate established by the pre&ndash;1999 aggregate
            grouping. In these cases, a single decline rate sufficiently
            describes the entire remaining productive life of the grouping and
            the expected performance of the calculated average well has little
            influence over determination of the group parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
            In groupings of wells drilled more recently (2014, 2015, etc.),
            actual group production history data is unlikely to provide a good
            basis upon which to project future oil production. In these cases,
            the expected performance of the average well is more speculative
            with respect to the applicable current and future decline rates.
          </p>
          <p>Group performance parameters are available in Appendix A3.3.</p>
          <h3 id="sa122">A1.2.2 Methods for Future Wells</h3>
          <p>
            In this report, &ldquo;future wells&rdquo; are those brought on
            production from 1 January 2017 onwards. For future wells, projected
            oil production is based on the number of future wells to be drilled
            and the expected average performance characteristics of those wells.
            Historical trends in average well performance, obtained from
            production decline analysis of existing oil wells, are used to
            estimate average well performance for future wells.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa1221">A1.2.2.1 Performance of Future Wells</h3>
          <p>
            The performance of future wells is obtained for each oil grouping by
            extrapolating the production performance trends for average wells in
            past years, namely initial productivity of the average well and its
            associated decline rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some groupings, the initial productivity of the average oil well
            decreases over time. Recently however, some conventional and tight
            groupings have average oil wells with initial productivity which has
            been increasing due to technology, as displayed in Figure A1.6. This
            graph shows the IP rates for oil wells in the Peace River Light,
            Tight, Colorado, Mannville, Jurassic, Triassic grouping. The IP rate
            for future oil wells is estimated by extrapolating the trend in each
            oil grouping, taking into account technological trends and possible
            recovery constraints. Historical and projected initial
            productivities for average wells for future oil groupings are in
            Appendix A4.1 and A4.2.

            months elapsed to reach the second decline rate. Figure A1.7 shows
            the historical and projected values of these parameters for the
            average Eastern Alberta heavy, conventional, upper Mannville well.

          <h3 id="sa1222">A1.2.2.2 Number of Future Wells</h3>
          <p>
            Projecting the number of future wells requires an estimate of the
            annual number of oil wells to be drilled and placed into production
            for each grouping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure A1.8 is the flowchart describing the methodology for
            projecting the number of oil wells for each year over the projection
            period. The key inputs are annual drilling investment, costs per
            drill day, and days to drill a well. Adjustments to these three key
            inputs (shown as yellow boxes in Figure A1.8) produce different
            projections of drilling activity in the WCSB. Other required inputs
            are shown in the green boxes in Figure A1.8. The values for these
            other inputs are estimated from an analysis of historical data.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the projection, the Board allocates oil drill days between each
            of the oil groupings. The allocation fractions are determined from
            historical trends and the Board&rsquo;s projection of development
            potential for each of the groupings. Recently, the allocation
            fractions reflect the historical trends of an increasing focus on
            deeper formations and increasing development of tight oil plays and
            the Duvernay Shale. Tables of the historical data (drill days and
            allocation fractions) and the projected allocation fractions are
            available in Appendix B.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of oil wells drilled in each year for a grouping is
            calculated by dividing the drill days targeting that grouping, by
            the average number of drill days per well.

            The decline parameters describing the expected future production of
            each grouping are in Appendix A3.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parameters describing future production for all of these
            groupings are the production rate as of December 2017 and as many as
            five future decline rates that apply to specified timeframes in the
            future. For the older groupings of wells, where production appears
            to have stabilized at a final decline rate, only one future decline
            rate is needed to describe future group production. For newer wells
            the decline rate that applies over future months changes as the
            group performance progresses towards the final stable decline
            period. For these newer well groupings, three to four different
            decline rates have been determined to describe future performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The future production projected for these groupings represents the
            production that would occur from the WCSB if no further oil wells
            were added after 2017.

          <p>
            While production projections for existing oil wells are more
            predictable, production projections for future oil wells are much
            less so. The key uncertainty is the level of oil drilling that will
            occur. Various cases are analysed to address the uncertainty
            inherent in the oil drilling projections.

            A2.2.1 Performance Parameters for Future Average Oil Wells
          </h3>
          <p>
            The overall trend for initial productivity of the average oil well
            in the WCSB is shown in Figure A2.1. Between 2002 and 2007, initial
            productivity decreased as conventional resources matured. However,
            the trend reversed upward from 2008 to 2016 given the focus on
            deeper resources. The average IP dropped in 2017 as a result of
            increased number of shallower wells&ndash;which have lower
            productivity rates&ndash;drilled in SK. This increases in 2018, as
            fewer wells are drilled and the focus shifts to the deeper
            resources. This increase stays level over the projection and the
            effect of the focus on deeper wells balances out the effect of a
            maturing resource with fewer sweet spots.

            Projected average well performance is the same in all six cases
            assessed for this report. Overall, production varies between the
            cases as a result of differing levels of oil drilling activity, as
            discussed further in the next section.

            Drilling activity in a case depends on the assumed oil prices in
            that case. Figure A2.2 indicates the projected number of oil wells
            for all groupings in each case.

            drill days and oil wells for each grouping, by case.

          <p>
            As indicated in Appendix A1.1.5, oil production projections for the
            thermal and CO<sub>2</sub> enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects are
            based on extrapolation of prior trends and currently announced plans
            of producers. Production from EOR projects in SK grows substantially
            over the projection.

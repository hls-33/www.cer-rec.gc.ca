              Analysis in the <em>Energy Futures</em> series is not a prediction
              of what will take place in the future. Rather,
              <em>Energy Futures </em>employs economic, and energy supply and
              demand models, to make projections based on a certain set of
              assumptions of what we know today about technology, energy and
              climate policies, human behaviour and the structure of the
              economy. Over the projection period, it is likely that
              developments beyond the realm of normal expectations, such as
              geopolitical events or technological breakthroughs, will occur.
              Likewise, new information becomes available and trends, policies,
              and technology evolve. Readers of this analysis should consider
              the projections a baseline for discussing Canada&rsquo;s energy
              future today, not a prediction of what will take place

            Letter from the Chair and CEO of the National Energy Board
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am pleased to present the latest edition of the National Energy
            Board&rsquo;s (NEB or Board) <em>Energy Futures</em> series:
            <em>Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2016: Update </em>(Update 2016).
            This report builds upon the report the Board released in January
            2016, which was prepared at a time of considerable change for the
            Canadian and global energy systems. The Paris climate agreement had
            just been adopted and governments in Canada were beginning to take
            ambitious actions related to climate change. Meanwhile, the price of
            crude oil had dropped by more than US$10 per barrel over a two month
            period, and was just above US$ 30 per barrel on the day of the
            report&rsquo;s release.
          </p>
          <p>
            In January we committed to providing an update to our work in fall
            2016 to continue to inform Canadians on evolving market and policy
            conditions. Update 2016 delivers the NEB&rsquo;s latest long-term
            energy supply and demand outlook for Canada, incorporating
            developments over the past year. As the only publically available
            long-term energy supply and demand outlook covering all energy
            commodities and all provinces and territories, this provides
            Canadians a key reference point for discussing the country's energy
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Update 2016 also comes during a time of transition. Earlier this
            month the Government of Canada announced its plan to price carbon
            pollution, a central component of the Pan-Canadian Framework on
            Clean Growth and Climate Change. The plan, which ensures all
            jurisdictions in Canada have some form of carbon pricing in place by
            2018, represents perhaps one of the most significant federal climate
            policy announcement in Canada to date. This plan was revealed while
            this report was in production and consequently this policy is not
            included in these projections.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this significant policy is not included in this report, a
            baseline outlook is an important part of having an informed energy
            dialogue. The projections in Update 2016 suggest that energy use,
            including energy derived from fossil fuels, increases but at a
            slower pace compared to our January 2016 projections, and much
            slower than the last 25 years. Crude oil production continues to
            grow in the Reference Case but the oil price is a key uncertainty
            for future growth. Recent policies that target the electricity
            sector have a large impact, with even more growth in renewables than
            projected in our January report, and by 2040, coal-fired generation
            without carbon capture and storage technology accounts for a very
            small part of Canada&rsquo;s electricity mix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Canadians need up-to-date, unbiased and factual energy information
            to form their own opinions and make decisions affecting their own
            energy futures. The Board will continue to provide this through our
            <em>Energy Futures</em> series as well as our many other energy
            information publications. We are also committed to making our
            information more accessible and transparent for Canadians, and this
            is why I would also suggest users of this report visit our
            <em
              ><a href="https://apps2.cer-rec.gc.ca/dvs/"
                >Explore Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future</a
              ></em
            >
            visualizations, which provides an opportunity to interact with the
            large dataset behind these projections. In addition, the recent
            ratification of the Paris Agreement suggests that momentum globally
            and in Canada on climate change is increasing. As a result, the
            Board will update these projections in 2017 to reflect evolving
            climate policy frameworks in Canada.

          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or Board) released its latest
            long-term energy outlook,
            <em
              >Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2016: Energy Supply and Demand
              Projections to 2040</em

            (EF 2016), in January 2016. This report,<em>
              Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2016: Update</em
            >
            (Update 2016), takes into account new information since that
            analysis was completed and provides an updated perspective on
            Canada&rsquo;s energy outlook.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that the projections presented in Update
            2016 are a baseline for discussing Canada&rsquo;s energy future
            today and <strong>do not</strong> represent the NEB&rsquo;s
            predictions of what will take place over the next 25 years. The
            projections are based on assumptions which allow for analysis of
            possible outcomes. Any assumptions made about current or future
            energy infrastructure or policy developments are strictly
            theoretical and have no bearing on the regulatory proceedings that
            are, or will be, before the Board.

            Key Finding 1: Update 2016 includes several recently announced
            climate policies. Future climate action remains a key uncertainty to
            the projections.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The last edition of <em>Energy Futures</em> was released in January
            2016, a time of significant change from a climate policy perspective
            in Canada. Following the Paris climate agreement in late 2015, the
            particular nature of future federal and provincial climate actions
            was largely unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            The months prior to, and the year following, that agreement saw
            renewed ambition among federal and provincial governments to act on
            climate issues. Since then, numerous new climate policies and action
            plans have been announced. The inclusion of additional climate
            policies has important implications for the projections in Update
            2016 as discussed throughout this report. Recently announced
            policies that are modelled include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Alberta&rsquo;s carbon levy on end-users and large industrial
              emitters
            </li>
            <li>The accelerated phase-out of coal in Alberta</li>
            <li>Ontario&rsquo;s economy-wide cap and trade program</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Canada&rsquo;s climate framework is still evolving. While some
            recently announced climate policies are included in the projections,
            many are not. Sufficient information is required to reliably factor
            new programs or policies into the economic and energy modelling
            underpinning this analysis. As these announced policies and action
            plans develop, they have potential to significantly impact the
            outcomes of upcoming editions of <em>Energy Futures</em>. Given that
            more than 80 per cent of Canada&rsquo;s greenhouse gas (GHG)
            emissions are related to the consumption and production of energy,
            the details of policies not included in Update 2016, and of future
            climate policies, represent key uncertainties for the Canadian
            energy outlook.
          </p>
          <p>
            The projections in Update 2016 do not model targets or goals, but
            rather the policies in place to achieve them. Canada&rsquo;s target
            of reducing GHG emissions by 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from 2005 levels
            by 2030 is not explicitly modelled in this analysis.
          </p>
          <div

            <p>
              Policies that were announced and implemented prior to September
              2015, such as Quebec’s cap and trade system and the carbon tax in
              B.C., were included in EF 2016 and are also modelled in Update
              2016.

          </div>
          <h4>
            Key Finding 2: Energy use, including energy derived from fossil
            fuels, increases but at a slower pace compared to EF 2016.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Total end-use energy consumption in the Reference Case increases by
            13 per cent over the 25 year projection period, reaching nearly 13
            000 petajoules (PJ) by 2040. The annual average growth rate of 0.5
            per cent is considerably slower compared to the previous 25 years,
            when consumption increased by 1.3 per cent per year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relative to the <em>Energy Futures</em> Reference Case projection
            released in January 2016, energy use grows more slowly. By 2040,
            total consumption is nearly 900 PJ, or almost seven per cent lower
            in Update 2016. The inclusion of recently announced climate
            policies, lower crude oil production projections, and somewhat
            slower economic growth are key drivers of this change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fossil fuel use in Canada also grows over the projection period.
            Including energy used to generate electricity; fossil fuel energy
            use increases from just over 10 000 PJ in 2015 to about 11 300 PJ in
            2040, or an average increase of 0.5 per cent per year. While fossil
            fuel use increases, the mix of fuels becomes less GHG-intensive, as
            the share of coal consumption decreases. Compared to EF 2016, fossil
            fuel consumption is 11 per cent, or almost 1 300 PJ lower by 2040 in
            Update 2016.

          </p>
          <p>
            The results of Update 2016 imply that energy-related GHG emissions
            increase over the projection period. It is likely that additional
            actions beyond those included in Update 2016 are required for Canada
            to achieve its international targets related to climate change.
            Upcoming <em>Energy Futures</em> editions could contain considerably
            different fossil fuel consumption projections as additional details
            about announced policies and action plans become available.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Key Finding 3: The crude oil price assumptions in Update 2016 are
            lower to reflect recent market developments, resulting in lower
            crude oil production projections.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The price of crude oil is a key driver of the Canadian energy
            system. The Reference Case price assumptions in Update 2016 are
            lower compared to EF 2016, reflecting updated perspectives on global
            crude oil supply and demand trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Reference Case Brent crude oil price increases from US$45 per
            barrel (bbl) in 2016 to US$68/bbl in 2020 in inflation adjusted
            terms. After 2020, the price gradually rises to US$90/bbl by 2040.
            The Reference Case crude oil price assumption is US$17/bbl lower
            than in EF 2016 by 2040.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Reference Case, Canadian crude oil production increases from
            639 thousand cubic metres per day (10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d),
            or four million barrels per day (4.0 MMb/d) in 2015 to 900
            10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (5.7 MMb/d) in 2040, a 41 per cent
            increase. This increase is driven primarily by a
            72&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase in oil sands production, which
            reaches 691 10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (4.3 MMb/d) by 2040, up
            from 402 10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (2.5 MMb/d) in 2015. Total
            crude oil production increases less quickly than in EF 2016, largely
            due to lower price assumptions, with total production 62
            10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d, or 391 thousand barrels per day
            (Mb/d) lower by 2040.

            The Canadian crude oil production projections vary significantly
            depending on crude oil price assumptions. The global price is
            determined by supply and demand for oil, driven by factors like
            economic growth, technological developments, and geopolitics.
            Factors like domestic climate policies, such as those recently
            implemented in Alberta, and access to pipeline infrastructure can
            impact Canadian production. However, the results of the High and Low
            Price Cases suggest that global supply and demand drivers will
            likely be the most important determinant of future Canadian oil
            production.

            Key Finding 4: The electricity sector adds new wind, solar, hydro,
            and natural gas-fired generation to accommodate demand growth and
            replace coal-fired generation.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Canada benefits from a very low carbon electricity system. Over 80
            per cent of electricity generated in 2015 was derived from
            non-fossil fuel sources, the majority of which was hydroelectric
            power. While hydro generation continues to be the dominant source of
            electricity in Canada, the declining cost of renewables and
            increasing regulations on coal-fired generation continue to reduce
            the GHG intensity of the electricity system over the projection
            period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electricity generated from coal, a GHG-intensive power source, drops
            to 10 per cent of current levels by 2040. Federal regulations result
            in the retirement of many coal facilities and this trend is
            accelerated by the planned phase-out of coal in Alberta by 2030.
            More than one third of the all coal consumed in Canada in 2040 is
            used by facilities in Saskatchewan that are enabled with carbon
            capture and storage (CCS) technology.  In total, coal-fired
            generating capacity declines to 1.8 gigawatts (GW) by 2040, over
            eight GW less than in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            To replace declining coal generation and accommodate new electricity
            demand growth, considerable natural gas, wind, solar, biomass, and
            hydro capacity is added over the projection period. Hydroelectric
            capacity increases by nine GW, or 12 per cent from 2015 to 2040.
            Combined, wind, solar, and biomass capacity more than doubles over
            the projection period, adding 17 GW of generating capacity by 2040.
            Natural gas is increasingly used as a baseload power source,
            particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, with net capacity
            increasing by 17 GW from 2015 to 2040.

          <p>
            The National Energy Board is an independent federal, quasi-judicial
            regulator that promotes safety and security, environmental
            protection, and economic efficiency in the Canadian public interest
            within the mandate set by Parliament for the regulation of
            pipelines, energy development, and trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board's main responsibilities of the NEB are established in the
            <em>National Energy Board Act </em>(the NEB Act) and include
            regulating:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the construction, operation and abandonment of oil and gas
              pipelines that cross international borders or
              provincial/territorial boundaries, as well as the associated
              pipeline tolls and tariffs;
            </li>
            <li>
              the construction and operation of international power lines, and
              designated interprovincial power lines; and
            </li>
            <li>
              imports of natural gas, and exports of crude oil, natural gas,
              oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), refined petroleum products and
              electricity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, in specified areas, the Board has regulatory
            responsibilities for oil and gas exploration and production
            activities under the NEB Act,
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA), the
            <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em> (CPRA), and the
            <em>North West Territories&rsquo; Oil and Gas Operations Act</em>
            (OGOA) and <em>Petroleum Resources Act</em> (PRA). For oil and
            natural gas exports, the Board&rsquo;s role is to evaluate whether
            the oil and natural gas proposed to be exported is surplus to
            reasonably foreseeable Canadian requirements, having regard to the
            trends in the discovery of oil or gas in Canada. The Board monitors
            energy markets, and assesses Canadian energy requirements and trends
            of oil and natural gas discovery to support its responsibilities
            under Part&nbsp;VI of the NEB Act. The Board periodically publishes
            assessments of Canadian energy supply, demand, and markets in
            support of its ongoing market monitoring. These assessments address
            various aspects of energy markets in Canada. This report,
            <em>Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2016: Update</em> (Update 2016) is
            one such assessment that projects long-term Canadian energy supply
            and demand trends.

              The findings in EF 2016 were based on inputs, assumptions, and
              policies and programs in place at the time of the analysis, which
              was summer 2015. The period during and following that analysis was
              characterized by considerable uncertainty and volatility in
              domestic and global energy markets.

              This report,
              <em>Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2016: Update </em> builds upon
              the analysis in EF 2016. The crude oil and natural gas price
              assumptions were decreased to reflect recent trends. The federal
              and many provincial governments made several major climate policy
              announcements since the completion of EF 2016 analysis. These new
              policies have been included to the extent possible.

            <li>
              Update 2016 considers three cases:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Reference Case, based on a current macroeconomic outlook
                  and a moderate view of energy prices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The High and Low Price Cases, which address uncertainties

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              As noted in Chapter 3, the cases are based on certain key
              assumptions including that over the long term, all energy
              production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as
              needed.

              While developing this report the NEB sought input from various
              energy experts and stakeholders to gather input and feedback on
              the preliminary projections. The Board would like to thank all
              participants for their contributions to Update 2016.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over the projection period, it is likely that developments beyond
              the realm of normal expectations, such as geopolitical events or
              technological breakthroughs, will occur. Likewise, new information
              becomes available and trends, policies, and technology evolve.
              Readers of this analysis should consider the projections a
              baseline for discussing Canada&rsquo;s energy future today, not a
              prediction of what will take place.

          <h2 id="s2">Chapter 2: Recent Developments and Key Assumptions</h2>
          <p>
            The Canadian energy system is constantly changing. Factors like
            technology, economics, infrastructure, societal preferences, and
            government policy and programs continually influence how energy is
            produced, transported, and consumed in Canada. This section
            discusses what significant changes occurred since the EF 2016
            analysis was completed in summer 2015.<strong> </strong>
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_1">Crude Oil Prices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Crude oil prices are a key driver of the Canadian energy system.
              Canada is a major crude oil producer and prices are an important
              driver of future production growth. The price of refined petroleum
              products, such as gasoline and diesel, are closely related to
              crude oil prices and can influence energy use.

              From 2011 to mid-2014, global crude oil prices were relatively
              stable near US$100/bbl. Prices dropped steadily starting in
              mid-2014, with the Brent crude oil price falling to US$50/bbl by
              January 2015, and to less than US$30/bbl in January 2016. In
              spring 2016 the Brent crude price began to increase, nearing
              US$50/bbl by summer. Figure 2.1 shows the prices for Brent and
              West Texas Intermediate (WTI) from 2010 to mid-2016. Further
              information on factors driving the recent crude oil price decline
              is available in the &ldquo;Crude Oil Price Trends&rdquo; section

            <li>
              The High Price and Low Price Case assumptions in Update 2016 cover
              a wider range than in EF 2016, roughly 45 per cent above and below
              the Reference Case by 2040. This wider range reflects price
              volatility over the past two years and greater uncertainty in
              price expectations going forward.

            <li>
              Western Canadian Select (WCS), a benchmark price for Canadian
              heavy oil, represents the approximate value Canadian heavy oil and
              oil sands producers receive for their non-upgraded production. The
              difference between WCS and WTI is due primarily to their different
              physical properties and the cost to transport the marginal barrel
              of Canadian heavy oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast crude oil refining
              center. Crude oil can be moved by either pipeline or rail; the
              cost of rail transportation is generally more expensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              All cases assume that the differential between WTI and WCS widens
              by an additional US$6/bbl between 2018 and 2020 based on rail,
              rather than pipelines, providing incremental takeaway capacity
              over that period. After 2020 the differential returns to normal
              levels as this analysis assumes that, over the long term,
              infrastructure is built as needed. However, this assumption is a
              key uncertainty to the projections. Chapter 10 in EF 2016<sup

          <h3 id="s2_2">Natural Gas Prices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Natural gas prices have declined considerably over the past
              decade. Henry Hub prices fell from the US$6-9 per million British
              thermal units (MMBtu) range between 2006 and 2008 to less than
              US$4/MMBtu for the majority of the last five years. For much of
              the first half of 2016, Henry Hub prices were near US$2/MMBtu.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over the past several years many analysts have steadily reduced
              their long-term expectations for North American natural gas
              prices. Largely driven by continued improvements in drilling and
              completion technology, North American natural gas production has
              significantly increased, creating downward pressure on prices.
              Further discussion of these technology improvements are found in
              the &ldquo;Oil and Natural Gas Production from Shale and Tight
              Resources&rdquo; section in Chapter 2 of EF 2016<sup id="fn4-rf"

              Figure 2.3 depicts the Henry Hub natural gas price assumptions. In
              all cases, prices are roughly five per cent lower than EF 2016 in
              the long term. The Reference Case assumes that the Henry Hub price
              for natural gas increases from US$2.45/MMBtu in 2016 to
              US$4.30/MMBtu in 2040 in 2015 dollars.

          <h3 id="s2_3">Climate Policy Developments</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Discussion in EF 2016 highlighted numerous uncertainties
              surrounding the energy projections in that report. Future climate
              policies were chief among them. At the time of the analysis, the
              Paris Climate Change Conference had not taken place and the
              details of new, ambitious federal and provincial climate
              initiatives were limited or unknown.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many major climate policies were announced over the past year. The
              projections in Update 2016 include as many of these new policies
              as possible. However, several announced plans have not reached the
              stage where final regulations to implement the policies are
              available. The following criteria were applied to determine
              whether a certain policy was included in Update 2016:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sufficient detail is available to allow modeling of the
                  policy. When necessary, provincial governments were consulted
                  to obtain clarification on certain details.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The policy is unlikely to undergo substantial changes before
                  it is implemented.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Goals and targets, including Canada&rsquo;s international
                  climate targets, are not explicitly modelled. Rather, the
                  policies currently in place to meet those targets are
                  included.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Table A.1, found at the end of this document, describes many
              recent climate policy developments and whether that policy is
              included in the Update 2016 analysis. Policies already implemented
              as of summer 2015, such as Quebec&rsquo;s cap and trade system and
              British Columbia&rsquo;s (B.C.) carbon tax, are not included in
              the table but are still incorporated in the projections.
            </li>
            <li>
              As discussed in this report, additional policy action beyond those
              included in Update 2016 are likely required for Canada to achieve
              its international targets related to climate change. Climate
              policy in Canada continues to evolve and the nature of future
              policies remains a key uncertainty to the projections in Update
              2016.

          <h3 id="s3_1">Overview</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Analysis in this chapter focuses primarily on the key results of
              Update 2016 and how those results differ from the projections in
              EF 2016. Refer to the discussion in EF 2016 for a more thorough
              analysis of long-term energy supply and demand trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              Update 2016 includes three cases: the Reference, High Price and
              Low Price Cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Three key assumptions underpin these cases:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Over the long term, all energy production will find markets
                  and infrastructure will be built as needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Environmental and socio-economic considerations beyond the
                  included policies and programs are outside the scope of the
                  analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Energy markets are constantly evolving. Update 2016 is based
                  on the best available information at the time of the analysis.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              A key assumption in past <em>Energy Futures</em> editions was that
              only policies and programs that were law at the time of analysis
              were included in the projections. However, many recently announced
              climate policies have not yet become law but will have major
              implications for the Canadian energy system. Some of these
              announced, but not fully implemented, policies are included in
              Update 2016. Refer to Table A.1 at the end of this document for a
              detailed description of recently announced policies.

          <h3 id="s3_2">Macroeconomic Drivers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The economy is a key driver of the energy system. Economic growth,
              industrial output, inflation, exchange rates, and population
              growth all influence the Canadian energy system.
            </li>
            <li>
              The long-term outlook for economic growth in the Reference Case is
              slightly slower compared to EF 2016, as shown in Table 3.1. This
              is largely a result of lower crude oil production and somewhat
              lower expectations for industries like fertilizer production,
              forestry, and construction.

              Regionally, economic growth in the Reference Case is fastest in
              B.C. and Alberta, averaging 1.7 per cent per year from 2015 to
              2040. The investment associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG)
              exports and steady growth in oil sands production results in above
              average economic activity. Combined, Quebec and Ontario&rsquo;s
              annual economic growth averages 1.6 per cent over the projection
              period. Growth is slowest in Atlantic Canada because of slower
              population growth and declining offshore oil and natural gas
              production in the long term.

          <h3 id="s3_3">Energy Demand</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This section focuses mainly on end-use, or secondary energy
              demand. This includes energy used in four sectors: residential,
              commercial, industrial, and transportation. Secondary demand
              excludes energy used to generate electricity, which is accounted
              for in primary demand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure&nbsp;3.1 shows that energy use increased by
              1.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per year from 1990 to 2014. In the
              projection period, energy use increases more slowly, at an average
              rate of 0.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per year. This is a slightly lower
              rate of growth compared to EF 2016, which was 0.6 per cent per
              year from 2015 to 2040. In the Update 2016 Reference Case, total
              end-use energy consumption increases to 12 973 PJ by 2040; 6.5 per
              cent, or 895 PJ less than in EF 2016.

              projection period, reaching 6 918 PJ by 2040 in the Reference
              Case. Growth is driven mainly by energy use associated with
              growing oil sands and natural gas production, as well as moderate
              increases in manufacturing activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transportation energy use grows the least and is essentially flat
              over the projection period, growing at an average of 0.1 per cent
              per year. On-road passenger energy use declines steadily over the
              projection, as federal efficiency standards, carbon pricing in
              several large provinces, and slower population growth all act to
              reverse a long-term trend of increasing passenger transportation
              energy use. This is offset by continued increases in freight
              transportation demand, driven by growth in goods-producing
              industries and increasing demand for consumer goods.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure 3.2 shows transportation energy demand by fuel. Gasoline
              demand falls at an annual average of 0.5 per cent over the
              projection in line with declining passenger energy use. Diesel
              consumption increases steadily as it is the primary fuel in the
              freight sector. Emerging vehicle technologies, such as electric
              vehicles and LNG-powered freight vehicles, gain market share but
              do not significantly impact the overall fuel demand mix. Total
              transportation demand is notably lower in Update 2016 relative to
              EF 2016 as recently available data suggests diesel consumption
              decreased in 2015, largely due the economic slowdown in Alberta.

              Household energy use grows at an average rate of 0.2 per cent per
              year from 2015 to 2040, reaching 1 610 PJ by 2040. Slower growth
              in new home construction and efficiency improvements result in
              lower growth relative to the historical period. Commercial energy
              demand grows at 0.7 per cent per year, exhibiting the largest
              decrease in growth rate relative to the EF 2016 projections. This
              is largely driven by a slower economic outlook for industries like
              retail sales, office buildings, and public services.

              The impact of higher or lower prices on energy demand varies by
              province. Figure 3.3 shows that energy use grows more quickly in
              the High Price Case in Alberta, B.C., Saskatchewan and
              Newfoundland and Labrador. Those provinces produce significant
              quantities of oil and natural gas, which can be energy-intensive
              processes. Growth is slower in the remaining provinces as higher
              prices reduce demand for natural gas and refined petroleum
              products, which are linked to the price of crude oil. This dynamic
              is reversed in the Low Price Case, with oil and natural gas
              producing provinces growing slower due to less oil and natural gas
              production growth. For all of Canada, demand growth is similar in
              all three cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Total energy intensity, measured as energy use per unit of
              economic activity, decreases by an average annual rate of
              1.1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in the Reference Case projection. Energy
              intensity improves more quickly than projected in EF 2016, a
              result of lower activity in some energy-intensive industries and
              the inclusion of new climate policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Primary energy demand, which includes energy used to generate
              electricity but excludes end-use electricity consumption,
              increases at an average annual rate of 0.4 per cent over the
              projection period, reaching 14 917 PJ in 2040. As shown in Figure
              3.4, the share of natural gas increases the most, driven by growth
              of demand for power generation and in the oil sands. Coal&rsquo;s
              share of primary demand falls considerably, mostly due to
              declining coal-fired power generation.

              In 2015, oil sands production made up more than half of
              Canada&rsquo;s oil production. Despite the steep decline in crude
              oil prices since mid-2014, recently completed oil sand projects,
              as well as those under currently construction, contribute to
              steady production growth in the first five years of the
              projection. As shown in Figure 3.6, the Alberta wildfires impacted
              production in 2016 but they do not have a significant impact
              thereafter. In the Reference Case, total oil sands production
              reaches 691&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (4.3 MMb/d), a 72
              per cent increase from 2015 levels of

            <li>
              Recent in situ oil sands project deferrals and cancellations
              result in slower production growth between 2019 and 2022 in the
              Reference Case. As prices increase gradually, in situ oil sands
              projects become more economic and production increases steadily,
              reaching 436&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (2.7&nbsp;MMb/d)
              by 2040, more than doubling from 2015 levels. Lower price
              assumptions are the primary driver of lower in situ bitumen
              production compared to EF 2016, with production
              13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent lower by the end of the projection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mined bitumen production increases robustly from 2017 to 2020, as
              facilities currently under construction come online. After 2020,
              production remains steady as the price and investment climate make
              large scale mining projects less economic. Mined production
              reaches 255 &nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.6 MMb/d) by
              2024, an increase of 38 per cent from the 2015 level of
              185&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.2&nbsp;MMb/d), and stays
              relatively flat thereafter. The mined bitumen projections in
              Update 2016 are similar to the projections in EF 2016.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural gas is the primary fuel used for oil sands extraction. A
              key measure of the energy efficiency of thermal oil sands
              production, which includes cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and
              steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), is the steam to oil ratio
              (SOR). As shown in Figure 3.7, the average SOR for thermal
              production declined by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2015.
              This decline was the result of efficiency gains from process
              improvements and the introduction of new technologies.

            <li>
              Figure 3.7 also indicates that this rate of improvement continues
              over the next decade. Many of the projects coming online in this
              timeframe add production from high quality oil sands reservoirs,
              which generally have lower SORs. Over the longer term, average
              annual SOR improvements slow as new oil sands projects move to
              areas where steam requirements can often be higher. In addition,
              oil sands reservoirs become less efficient as they produce more
              oil, which has an upward effect on SORs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improvements in SORs vary in the price cases as the rate of future
              production growth impacts both the quality of the reservoirs being
              brought online and the extent to which existing projects reach a
              point of increasing SORs. In the High Price Case, overall
              intensity improvements are somewhat lower as lower quality
              reservoirs are developed while the opposite occurs in the Low
              Price Case as fewer new projects with lower quality reservoirs are
              built.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
              Conventional light oil production, most of which occurs in Alberta
              and Saskatchewan, is relatively flat until 2019 due to low prices.
              As prices gradually increase, production begins to rise, with
              western Canadian conventional production reaching
              106&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (664 Mb/d) in 2027. Later
              in the projection, light oil production begins to decline slowly,
              as productivity rates from new wells start to decline.
            </li>
            <li>
              Production of conventional heavy oil increases slightly in the
              short term, driven by the application of enhanced oil recovery
              techniques such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water
              flooding. This growth slows and by 2024, conventional heavy oil
              production in western Canada begins to decline, reaching
              73&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (462 Mb/d) by 2040.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the Reference Case, Newfoundland and Labrador offshore
              production increases steadily over the next five years as the
              Hebron project comes online and Hibernia adds new production from
              satellite fields. After peaking at
              51.6&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (325 Mb/d) by 2022,
              production begins to enter natural decline. The Reference Case
              assumes production from a generic offshore discovery adds new
              production in 2030 before returning to a declining trend towards
              the end of the projection.

              After increasing steadily from 2012 to 2015, Canadian marketable
              natural gas production in the Reference Case begins to decline
              slowly, decreasing from 438 million cubic metres per day
              (10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d), or 15.4 billion cubic feet per
              day (Bcf/d) in 2016 to 421 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.8
              Bcf/d) in 2020 as prices are not sufficient to warrant enough
              drilling to maintain production levels. All three cases assume LNG
              exports from the B.C. Coast start in 2021 and increase by
              14&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (0.5&nbsp;Bcf/d) per year to
              reach 71&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (2.5&nbsp;Bcf/d) by
              2025. In the Reference Case the onset of these exports reverses
              the declining trend, with production reaching 489
              10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (17.3&nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2026, as shown
              in Figure 3.9. Higher prices encourage steady growth after 2026,
              with production reaching 502 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d
              (17.7&nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2040, 18 per cent higher than 2015 levels.

              Total Canadian production is slightly lower in Update 2016
              relative to EF 2016 throughout much of the projection period. This
              is a result of a later start date for LNG exports and a slightly
              lower price outlook. This is largely offset in the longer term by
              higher productivity improvements in some key producing regions. As
              a result, production in the Reference Case is less than one per
              cent lower in Update 2016 compared to EF 2016 by 2040.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural gas production in Alberta declines slightly over the first
              five years of the projection period as prices are too low to
              encourage enough drilling to outpace production declines from
              existing wells. As prices gradually rise, production in Alberta
              begins to steadily increase, reaching
              286&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (10.1 Bcf/d) by 2040, 2.3
              per cent higher than 2015 levels. Relative to EF 2016, production
              in Alberta is somewhat higher over the projection period due to
              higher production from emerging plays, namely the Duvernay Shale.
            </li>
            <li>
              B.C. production grows considerably from 2020 to 2026 with the
              onset of LNG exports. Production is relatively flat after 2026 and
              production reaches 210&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (7.4
              Bcf/d) by 2040. Reference Case production in B.C. is slightly
              lower than in EF 2016 due to the delayed onset of assumed LNG
              exports. Chapter 11 of EF 2016 provides additional context and
              analysis of higher or lower LNG exports on Canadian natural gas
              production.

            <li>
              Production from other provinces, including Saskatchewan, Nova
              Scotia, New Brunswick and the Territories, declines steadily over
              the projection period as new natural gas drilling activity is
              focused in Alberta and B.C.

              As shown in Figure 3.10, Canadian marketable natural gas
              production in the High Price Case averages
              761&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (26.8&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2040,
              or 52 per cent higher than the Reference Case. Western
              Canada&rsquo;s significant resource base, coupled with higher
              prices, encourages more drilling activity throughout the
              projection period. Canadian production in the Low Price Case
              declines until 2021 when assumed LNG exports reverse this trend.
              After 2025, production is relatively flat, reaching
              421&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.8&nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2040,
              16 per cent lower than the Reference Case.

              Natural gas liquids (NGLs), which include ethane, propane,
              butanes, and pentanes plus, are found in raw natural gas in
              varying proportions and are mostly extracted at natural gas
              processing facilities. NGLs are also produced as a by-product of
              oil refining or bitumen upgrading. As shown in Figure 3.11,
              combined NGL production increases steadily over the projection
              period, from 126&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (790 Mb/d) in
              2015 to 145&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (911 Mb/d) in 2040.

              Ethane production is relatively flat over the projection period,
              limited by the capacity of existing ethane petrochemical
              facilities. Propane, butanes, and pentanes plus production
              increases as most new natural gas drilling activity is centered in
              NGL-rich areas in Alberta and B.C. Compared to the projections in
              EF 2016, total NGL production is 10 per cent higher by 2040. This
              increase is the result of more gas being produced along with crude
              oil and tight gas production, both of which tend to contain more
              NGLs than other types of gas production.

              In the Reference Case, electric generating capacity increases by
              almost 32 GW from 2015 to 2040, increasing total installed
              capacity to 177 GW. Installations of new capacity over the
              projection period total 46 GW, the majority of which is hydro,
              natural gas and non-hydro renewable facilities. Capacity
              retirements total 14 GW from 2015 to 2040, mostly coal plants,
              driven by existing federal coal regulations and Alberta&rsquo;s
              planned coal phase-out. Ontario will refurbish much of its
              existing nuclear capacity between 2019 and 2034 and the Pickering
              plant retires in the early 2020s.
            </li>
            <li>
              The capacity additions and retirements over the projection period
              drive changes to the electricity fuel mix. As shown in
              Figure&nbsp;3.12, the share of non-hydro renewable resources and
              natural gas increase substantially. Installed capacities of both
              resources grow significantly in Alberta where the phase-out of
              coal by 2030 requires considerable capacity replacement.

              coal consumed in Canada in 2040 is used by facilities in
              Saskatchewan that are enabled with CCS technology. The shares of
              nuclear and hydro capacity decline as their total capacities stay

            <li>
              Currently, energy use and GHG emissions in Canada are closely
              related. The majority of GHGs emitted in Canada are a result of
              fossil fuel combustion. Fossil fuels include crude oil, natural
              gas, coal, and refined petroleum products such as gasoline and
              diesel. In 2015, they provided the vast majority of energy used to
              heat homes and businesses, transport goods and people, and power
              industrial equipment. Emissions from fossil fuels, including those
              used for the production of energy, accounted for 81 per cent of
              Canadian GHG emissions in 2014<sup id="fn5-rf"

                ></sup
              >. The remaining emissions are from non-energy sources such as
              agricultural and industrial processes, and waste handling.

            <li>
              The amount of GHGs emitted by various fossil fuels depends on the
              emission content of the fuel and how efficiently the fuel is used.
              Not all fossil fuels produce the same amount of GHG emissions when
              converted to energy. For example, natural gas emits slightly more
              than half the GHGs emitted by coal to produce the same amount of
              energy. As a result, the outlook for energy-related GHG emissions
              depends on fossil fuel consumption trends as well as the mix of
              fuels used.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Reference Case projection for total fossil fuel consumption is
              shown in Figure 3.15. From 2015 to 2040, the use of fossil fuel
              energy increases by 13 per cent, an average rate of 0.5 per cent
              per year.

              Compared to EF 2016, consumption of fossil fuels is lower
              throughout the projection period, and is 11&nbsp;per cent lower by
              2040. The introduction of carbon pricing policies in Alberta and
              Ontario is a factor in this trend. This impact is tempered,
              however, by lower crude oil and natural gas price assumptions in
              Update 2016, making those fuels relatively less expensive than in
              EF 2016.
            </li>
            <li>
              While fossil fuel consumption does grow over the projection, a
              changing fuel mix leads to declining fossil fuel GHG intensity, as
              shown in Figure 3.17. A greater share of natural gas, the least
              GHG-intensive fossil fuel, and a declining share of coal, a more
              GHG-intensive fuel, drives this trend. The GHG intensity of the
              fossil fuel mix declines by seven per cent from 2015 to 2040,
              slightly more than in EF 2016. This is primarily due to lower coal
              consumption in Update 2016.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Relative to EF 2016, fossil fuel consumption growth is lower and
              the GHG intensity of the fuel mix declines slightly faster. Given
              Canada&rsquo;s complex and diverse energy system, many factors
              contribute to this shift, including revised projections for
              economic growth and energy production. However, the inclusion of
              new climate policies in the Update 2016 projection plays a key
              role in these changing trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              The growth in fossil fuel consumption still outpaces the decline
              in GHG intensity of Canada&rsquo;s fossil fuel consumption mix.
              This implies increasing energy-related GHG emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Several climate policies and plans have been announced recently
              but were not included in the Update 2016 projections, including
              the recently announced Pan-Canadian Approach to Pricing Carbon
              Pollution. The inclusion of these new polices could result in
              reduced fossil fuel consumption projections in upcoming
              <em>Energy Future</em> editions.

          <h3 id="s3_8">Key Uncertainties</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The results of Update 2016 imply that additional actions beyond
              those included in Update 2016 are required for Canada to achieve
              its international targets related to climate change. Federal and
              provincial governments continue to work on policy frameworks to
              reach their climate goals. Many of these frameworks are described
              in Table A.1 but insufficient details were available at the time
              of analysis to include them in Update 2016. As climate policy in
              Canada continues to evolve, the nature of future policies remain
              an uncertainty for the long-term energy outlook.
            </li>
            <li>
              Update 2016 includes modest growth of emerging technologies.
              However, technology&rsquo;s influence on the energy system can be
              substantial and often difficult to predict. Speculating on whether
              or not technologies become game-changers due to sudden shifts in
              fundamental factors like costs and societal preferences, is beyond
              the scope of this analysis and represents a key uncertainty.
            </li>
            <li>
              This analysis assumes that over the long term, all energy
              production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as
              needed. However, projects to increase oil transportation capacity
              in North America have proven controversial. In addition, several
              proposed LNG export facilities aiming to access new markets for
              Canadian natural gas have been deferred or cancelled. Chapters 10
              and 11 in EF 2016 provide additional analysis of the impact of
              these key uncertainties to the Canadian energy outlook.
            </li>
            <li>
              The High and Low Price Cases cover some of the uncertainty related
              to future crude oil and natural gas prices. However, the
              possibility of higher, lower or volatile prices is still an
              uncertainty to the projections.
            </li>
            <li>
              Economic conditions can significantly affect Canadian energy use
              patterns. The outlook for demand of Canadian goods exported
              internationally is uncertain and could impact the growth of many
              energy intensive industries such as manufacturing, mining, and oil
              and gas.

                As part of the Pan-Canadian framework, the federal government
                outlined its proposed approach to carbon pricing in Canada in
                October 2016<sup id="fn10-rf"

                in 2018. The minimum price increases by $10 a year to reach $50
                per tonne in 2022. <br />
                Provinces and territories will have flexibility to either
                implement a direct price on carbon pollution or adopt a
                cap-and-trade system. Provinces and territories will have
                control of the revenue from carbon pricing and use the revenues
                as they see fit.

                  industrial processes such as hydroflurocarbons,
                  perflurocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.

                  A measure of the amount of energy per unit of volume of the
                  natural gas stream. Natural gas produced from oil and gas
                  wells primarily consists of methane but can also contain
                  natural gas liquids (NGLs) like ethane, propane, and butane.
                  Because NGLs burn hotter than methane on a per volume basis,
                  gas that is "rich" in NGLs has higher heat content than "lean"
                  gas.

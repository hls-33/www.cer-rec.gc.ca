          <h2 id="s2">Provincial and Territorial Comparison</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Canada is a large and diverse country; energy is produced and
              consumed differently across its unique regions. The provinces and
              territories differ in terms of energy resource availability,
              historical infrastructure, industrial structures, energy and
              environmental policies and regulations, consumer preferences, and
              weather conditions. These differences greatly influence current
              and projected energy trends.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Electricity Supply</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Future generation trends are largely driven by provincial or
              territorial demand, although some hydroelectric capacity
              additions, such as in Quebec, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and
              Labrador, will be exported to the United States (U.S.) or
              transferred to neighboring provinces. For example, when completed,
              the 824&nbsp;megawatt&nbsp;(MW) Muskrat Falls addition in Labrador
              will provide 20&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of its generation
              (approximately one terawatt hour, TW.h) to Nova Scotia on a firm
              basis, and Nova Scotia will also be able to purchase additional
              power, if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure 2.1 shows generation by province. Ontario and Quebec are
              the largest producers of electricity, generating approximately 25
              and 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total Canadian electricity,
              respectively. Their share of total Canadian electricity
              consumption is similar to the generation share.
            </li>
            <li>
              Alberta has the highest growth in generation over the projection,
              driven by industrial demand growth. New hydro developments during
              the projection period lead to significant increases in generation
              in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, B.C. and Manitoba. Ontario generation
              decreases in the mid-term, as nuclear refurbishments take place
              and a larger part of Ontario’s load is met by imports from
              neighboring provinces and the U.S. Electric generation in the
              territories is driven by domestic load, and can be quite volatile
              when large-scale mines are commissioned or shut down during the
              projection period.

            <li>
              Canada has a diverse electric capacity mix, largely determined by
              regional resource access, historical infrastructure, and policy
              initiatives. Figure&nbsp;2.2 illustrates the capacity mix for all
              provinces and territories, as well as the Canadian average, in
              2014 and 2040. Canada’s overall electric grid is dominated by
              hydroelectricity. Hydroelectricity provides the majority of
              electric capacity in Quebec, B.C., Manitoba, Newfoundland and
              Labrador, and Yukon. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia have
              primarily thermal-based electricity grids dominated by coal and
              natural gas, while the capacity in Northwest Territories (NWT) and
              Nunavut mostly consists of stand-alone thermal units that are
              fueled with refined products such as diesel and fuel oil. Ontario
              and New Brunswick have diverse mixes, employing renewable, natural
              gas, and nuclear power. Prince Edward Island (PEI) generates
              almost entirely wind electricity, although three quarters of its
              electricity is imported from New Brunswick.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the months since this analysis was completed (summer 2015),
              several provinces made announcements that would shift their
              electricity mix from the trends outlined in EF 2016. For example,
              in November 2015, the Government of Saskatchewan and SaskPower
              announced a goal to move towards 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent renewable
              electricity by 2030. The Alberta climate policy report from
              November 2015 suggested retirement of greenhouse gas
              (GHG)-emitting coal-fired power facilities by 2030, and increased
              emphasis on renewable generation.

          <h3>Oil Production</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Figure&nbsp;2.3 shows the EF 2016 Reference Case oil production
              outlook to 2040 by producing regions. Total Canadian oil
              production increases at an average annual growth rate of
              1.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per year, from
              3.9&nbsp;million&nbsp;barrels&nbsp;per&nbsp;day&nbsp;(MMb/d) in
              2014 to 6.1&nbsp;MMb/d in 2040. About 60 per cent of current oil
              production comes from the oil sands and it drives future
              production growth. There is also significant non-oil sands
              production in Saskatchewan, Alberta and offshore Newfoundland and
              Labrador.
            </li>
            <li>
              Production varies among the High and Low Price Cases, as well as
              the Constrained Case, with Alberta continuing to account for the
              majority of production in all cases as shown in Figure&nbsp;2.4.
              Overall production in the Low Price Case and Constrained Case is
              lower than in the Reference Case and production is higher in the
              High Price Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              East Coast offshore production increases in the medium term, with
              production from the Hibernia South and White Rose extensions
              coming online, as well as the Hebron Field, which begins
              production in 2017. The projections also assume a discovery of a
              500&nbsp;MMb field offshore of Newfoundland and Labrador. This
              field is assumed to start producing in 2025 in the Reference Case,
              2023 in the High Price Case and 2031 in the Low Price Case. After
              the startup of this field, production declines to the end of the
              projection period in all cases.

          <h3>Natural Gas Production</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Figure&nbsp;2.5 shows the EF 2016 Reference Case marketable
              natural gas production outlook to 2040 by producing region. Most
              Canadian natural gas production comes from B.C. and Alberta. In
              the Reference Case, B.C. leads production growth, with the assumed
              liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports of
              2.5&nbsp;billion&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;feet&nbsp;per&nbsp;day&nbsp;(Bcf/d)
              encouraging additional production. Alberta’s production declines
              over the projection period, although it still produces the
              majority of natural gas in Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              The EF 2016 High Price, Low Price, and High LNG and No LNG Cases
              show that various drivers will impact natural gas production in
              B.C. and Alberta differently (Figure 2.6). In B.C., natural gas
              production is impacted by both prices and LNG exports; however,
              the High LNG and No LNG Cases result in the highest and lowest
              growth in B.C. natural gas production, respectively. In Alberta,
              the Low Price Case results in lower production than the No LNG
              Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              Production profiles from areas outside of the Western Canadian
              Sedimentary Basin continue to decline over the projection period.
              This includes production in the territories, Ontario, New
              Brunswick and offshore Nova Scotia. The development of further
              resources is a possibility but is currently speculative and is not
              included in this analysis.

          <h3>Natural Gas Liquid Production</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Alberta currently produces most of Canada’s natural gas liquids
              (NGLs). Figure&nbsp;2.7 shows this continuing in the EF 2016
              outlook but also shows an increase for all NGLs in B.C. due to
              increasing natural gas production. Nova Scotia NGL production
              declines in line with its gas production outlook. Saskatchewan NGL
              production follows its gas production outlook, peaking in 2025 and
              decreasing thereafter.

          <h3>Energy Demand</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Energy use in Canada depends on many factors including: weather,
              technology trends, consumer tastes and preferences, policies and
              regulations, and economic variables such as income, employment,
              industrial activity, and energy prices. The projected trends,
              including the type of energy used, and how energy is used, vary
              significantly across Canada’s provinces and territories due to the
              country’s diversity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Energy use discussed in the figures below is end-use, or secondary

          <h3>Energy Demand Trends</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the Reference Case, total Canadian energy use grows from
              11&nbsp;626&nbsp;petajoules&nbsp;(PJ) in 2014 to
              13&nbsp;868&nbsp;PJ in 2040. As shown in Figure&nbsp;2.9, end-use
              levels vary substantially across the country and, with the
              exception of Atlantic Canada, there is generally a trend of
              increasing energy use.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the EF 2016 Reference Case, Alberta leads demand growth as it
              has for the last decade. Oil and gas production, particularly in
              the oil sands, is energy intensive. Alberta’s increasing energy
              use is related to the production trends and associated economic
              growth shown in Figures&nbsp;2.3, 2.4, and 2.5. While lower in
              absolute terms, B.C. experiences an increase resulting from the
              large increase in natural gas production required to supply the
              assumed LNG export facilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trends in Ontario and Quebec reflect a gradual increase in energy
              use after considerable declines from 2005 levels. This was related
              to the impact of the 2008-2009 global economic downturn, when both
              provinces saw significant declines in energy use, particularly in
              manufacturing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The increase in energy use in Saskatchewan reflects growth in
              potash mining, manufacturing and tight oil development expected to
              occur in the province during the projection. Increases in Manitoba
              relate to growth in manufacturing activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Given their relatively small populations, energy use trends in
              Atlantic Canada and the territories can be especially volatile.
              Changes in industrial activity, like the opening or closing of a
              single mine or plant, can have significant impacts on overall
              energy use. This is reflected in the outlook for the provinces and
              territories in these regions.

              Figure&nbsp;2.10 illustrates projected regional growth in energy
              consumption from 2014 to 2040 for the Reference, High and Low
              Price Cases. Total Canadian energy use grows by
              19&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent over the projection in the Reference Case,
              22 per cent in the High Case, and 17&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in the Low
              Case. The impact of higher and lower prices is not uniform across
              the country. Alberta and B.C. have the highest demand growth in
              the High Price Case, as higher oil and gas prices encourage higher
              energy production. This outweighs the effect of higher prices in
              other provinces, which tends to reduce demand. In the Low Price
              Case, lower growth in Alberta’s oil production and the
              corresponding economic impacts reduces demand, offsetting
              increasing demand from lower energy prices in other provinces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and NWT are the only
              provinces and territory that experience declining end-use demand.
              In Nova Scotia, this is related to projected population growth,
              slow economic growth, as well as the energy use associated with
              declining offshore gas production. In Newfoundland and Labrador,
              it is related to oil production declines from maturing offshore
              fields and the assumption that only one future discovery is
              developed. In NWT, it is related to the decline of natural gas
              production which reduces its availability. East Coast offshore and
              Northern exploration continues and future discoveries and
              developments in these areas represent a key uncertainty to the
              energy supply and demand projections for the territories and
              Atlantic Canada.

          <h3>Fuel Mix Trends</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The types of energy used vary between the provinces and
              territories. The three charts in Figure 2.11 reflect the share of
              secondary end-use demand for refined petroleum products and
              liquids, electricity, and natural gas<sup id="fn2-rf"
                ><a
                  class="fn-lnk "

                ></sup
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Atlantic Canada and the territories use a much higher share of
              refined products than the rest of the country, primarily due to
              the limited availability, infrastructure limitations, and
              relatively higher cost of other energy sources. Notably, these
              regions rely on liquid fuels for heat and electricity generation
              more than other regions because they are more economic and can be
              transported to remote locations by truck.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provinces with large hydroelectric generation capacities tend to
              have lower electricity prices and electricity comprises a higher
              share of energy demand. In these provinces, electricity is more
              likely to be used to heat homes and buildings, as well as power
              some large industrial activities. For example, Quebec maintains a
              large aluminum production sector which is an electricity-intensive
              production process.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the western provinces natural gas is used relatively more than
              other regions because it is readily available and price
              competitive. It is the primary heating fuel in these provinces,
              and is used extensively in industrial activity. The cost and
              availability of natural gas and NGLs in Ontario and the western
              provinces also makes them prime locations for petrochemical and
              fertilizer production which use either for feedstock.

          <h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Energy use and GHG emissions are directly related given the
              prevalence of fossil fuels in the Canadian and global energy mix.
              The majority of GHGs emitted in Canada result from the combustion
              of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include crude oil, natural gas,
              coal, and refined petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.
              Fossil fuels provide the vast majority of energy used to heat
              homes and businesses, transport goods and people, and power
              industrial equipment. Emissions from the combustion of fossil
              fuels, including those used for the production of energy,
              accounted for 81&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of Canadian GHG emissions in
              2013<sup id="fn3-rf"
                ><a
                  class="fn-lnk "
                  href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016pt/ndnts-eng.html#fn3"
                  ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>3</a
                ></sup
              >. The remaining emissions are from non-energy sources such as
              agricultural and industrial processes, and waste handling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Figure&nbsp;2.12 shows energy related GHG emissions by province
              and territory in 2005 and 2013, the last year for which this data
              is available from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Between
              2005 and 2013, Canada’s total GHGs dropped by
              three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, or 23&nbsp;Megatonnes (MT) carbon
              dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) equivalent. Key factors in this reduction
              include a drop in electric emissions due to declining coal-fired
              generation and increased renewable generation, as well as a
              decrease in industrial emissions associated with the 2008-2009
              global economic downturn. However, this decrease was offset by
              increasing emissions from the oil and gas production sector,
              driven by increased production.
            </li>
            <li>
              These national trends are reflected in the regional results. For
              example, Ontario’s decline in emissions is associated with its
              phase out of coal-fired electricity, while the increase in Alberta
              GHGs follows the demand trends shown in Figure&nbsp;2.9, where
              energy use and economic growth were driven by increasing oil
              production over this period.

              In the Reference Case, total fossil fuel energy consumption
              increases by 22&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from 2014 to 2040 at an average
              of 0.8&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per year. This implies a trend of
              increasing GHG emissions. These increases are somewhat offset by
              faster growth in less emissions-intensive fuels, such as natural
              gas, and slower growth in more emissions-intensive fuels such as
              coal and refined petroleum products. Reference Case fossil fuel
              consumption growth by province and territory from 2014 to 2040 is

              The fossil fuel demand projections in EF 2016 only include
              policies and programs that are law at the time of analysis in
              summer 2015. In recent months there have been several notable
              developments at the provincial level that provide considerable
              uncertainty to these projections, largely relating to the recent
              climate conference in Paris. These developments include:

                  In the spring of 2015, the Alberta government convened an
                  advisory panel to review the province’s climate policies and
                  provide advice on a new set of policies. In
                  November&nbsp;2015, the panel released a broad suite of policy
                  recommendations in its report to the Minister. Implementing an

                  In April&nbsp;2015, B.C. announced the formation of a Climate
                  Leadership Team to provide recommendations to build upon
                  B.C.’s existing Climate Action Plan. The Climate Leadership
                  Team released their report in late October&nbsp;2015<sup

                    ></sup
                  >. The report provides 32 recommendations, including the
                  development of several new strategies, and increasing B.C.’s
                  existing $30&nbsp;per&nbsp;tonne carbon tax by
                  $10&nbsp;annually, starting in 2018.

                  In late November, the Government of Saskatchewan and SaskPower
                  announced a target to increase the province’s share of
                  renewable electricity generation capacity to
                  50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent<sup id="fn8-rf"

                    ></sup
                  >. This is expected to be led by increases in wind power,
                  along with other renewables such as hydro, solar, biomass and
                  geothermal.

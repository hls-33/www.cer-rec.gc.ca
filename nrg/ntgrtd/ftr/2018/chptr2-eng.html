            The Canadian energy system is constantly evolving. Factors such as
            economics, infrastructure, and societal preferences influence the
            production, transportation, and consumption of energy in Canada.
            Technology, and climate policies and programs increasingly impact
            energy markets. This chapter provides an overview of recent energy
            market developments and climate policies. It also describes the key
            assumptions and recent developments underpinning the analysis in the
            report.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s1">Crude Oil Markets</h2>
          <h3>Current Context</h3>
          <p>
            Crude oil prices are a key driver of the Canadian energy system and
            are determined by global supply and demand. Canada is a major
            <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#crudeoil">crude oil</a> producer and
            prices are an important driver of future production growth.
            Increased Canadian oil production is largely due to technological
            improvements over the past decade. The prices of
            <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#refinedpetroleumproduct"
              >refined petroleum products</a
            >
            (RPPs), such as gasoline and diesel, are related to crude oil prices
            and can influence energy demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2011 to mid-2014, global crude oil prices typically ranged
            between US$100 and US$120 per barrel (bbl). From June 2014, prices
            dropped steadily, with the
            <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#brent">Brent</a> crude oil price
            falling to less than US$30/bbl in January 2016. In Canada, the price
            of
            <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#westerncanadianselect"
              >Western Canadian Select (WCS)</a

            dropped to US$17/bbl. Global prices began to rebound in 2016, and by
            2017, Brent prices reached US$65/bbl. The price rise and subsequent
            drop are evidence of an unbalanced global oil market. Years of
            rising demand and higher prices resulted in a global supply surplus,
            and record crude inventory builds.

            Recent developments suggest a rebalancing of global oil markets.
            Sustained production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum
            Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, combined with unexpected
            supply outages, particularly in Venezuela, have reduced global oil
            supply. Global oil demand outpaced supply in 2017 and is expected to
            do the same in 2018<sup id="fn2-rf"

            >. Both United States (U.S.) and Organization for Economic
            Co-operation and Development (OECD) crude and product inventory
            stocks have been reduced and are currently near their five-year

            crude oil, a symptom that emerges when oil traders generally view a
            market as being undersupplied. Prices have increased over 2017
            levels and hovered in a tight range around their 20-year

            Although global prices have risen, production in North America has
            outpaced incremental infrastructure, leading to discounted prices.
            U.S. production growth, particularly from the Permian Basin, has put
            pressure on pipeline capacity to remove oil from the region. This
            resulted in

            (WTI) price discounts to Brent at Cushing, OK climbing to nearly
            US$10 in mid-2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            In western Canada, production increased steadily while export
            capacity remained at 2016 levels or below<sup id="fn5-rf"

            leading to large price discounts for Canadian crude benchmarks. From
            January to July 2018, WCS has averaged US$21.86 lower than WTI, an
            increase in the differential of 71% over the same period in 2017.
            While some discount should be expected based on quality and
            transportation costs to American refineries compared to other light
            crude streams, this normally ranges between US$10 and US$15. Western
            Canadian heavy oil production increased by 9.8% in 2017, and in the
            first half of 2018 was 8% higher year-over-year. Without incremental
            pipeline capacity available, some production has shifted to rail,
            which is more expensive. The WCS-WTI discount has settled over US$30
            on some days. Figure 2.1 illustrates Brent, WTI, and WCS prices and
            differentials over the past five years. Western Canadian light oil
            benchmarks are also affected, with the Canadian Light Sweet (CLS)
            differential to WTI averaging US$7.62 per barrel in the first half
            of 2018, more than double the 2017 US$2.90 differential.

              This chart shows the Brent, WTI, and WCS prices and discounts, in
              nominal USD per barrel, from 2013 to 2018. Brent has declined from
              $102.9/bbl in June 2013 to $72.5/bbl in June 2018. WTI has
              declined from $95.8/bbl in June 2013 to $68.1/bbl in June 2018.
              WCS has declined from $75.4/bbl in June 2013 to $48.6/bbl in June
              2018. The WTI-Brent differential has declined from $7.15/bbl in
              June 2013 to $4.5/bbl by June 2018. The WCS-WTI differential has
              declined from $20.4/bbl in June 2013 to $19.5/bbl by June 2018.

          <h3>Expected WCS-WTI Differential Impacts</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the Canadian production growth over the next several years
            comes from large-scale oil sands projects that were commissioned
            well in advance of the fall in oil prices. It is expected that
            western Canadian oil exports will surpass pipeline export capacity,
            in which case the WCS-WTI differential could average anywhere
            between US$18 and about US$30.

            refinery capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast resulting in lower WCS
            prices as Canadian heavy crude competes to maintain access to the
            fixed available refining capacity. While the degree and duration of
            the IMO impact on global refining and crude markets is uncertain, it
            will likely exert downward pressure on WCS prices for the duration
            of its influence.

          <h3>EF2018 Crude Oil Price Assumptions</h3>
          <p>
            Figure 2.2 shows the Reference Case crude oil price assumptions for
            EF2018. Brent prices, in constant 2016 US$, are expected to decline
            in 2019 from current levels and remain at US$68/bbl for the next few
            years. In 2022, Brent is expected to start increasing and reach
            US$75/bbl by 2027, where it remains over the projection period. This
            medium-term price increase reflects the need to develop higher cost
            resources to replace continuously declining existing supplies and
            meet increasing global oil demand. The flat, long-term trajectory
            suggests that oil supply can then grow to meet modest global demand
            growth at a long-term US$75/bbl price level. The current Brent-WTI
            discount is assumed to decrease steadily from its current high
            levels, reaching US$3.50/bbl by 2024, roughly reflecting
            transportation costs from Cushing, OK to the Gulf Coast.

            <p>
              This chart shows Brent, WTI, and WCS price assumptions, in 2016
              USD/bbl, for the Reference Case. Brent increases from $53/bbl in
              2017 to $75/bbl by 2027, and remains at $75/bbl until 2040. WTI
              increases from $50.8/bbl in 2017 to $71.5/bbl by 2027, and remains
              at $71.5/bbl until 2040. WCS is $38.3/bbl in 2017, increasing to
              $42.8/bbl in 2018. After 2018, WCS decline to a low of $36.2/bbl
              in 2020, before increasing to $57.5/bbl in 2027, where it remains
              for the remaining projection period.
            </p>
          </details>
          <p>
            The combined effect of Canadian crude discounts and the IMO
            regulations are assumed to push the real WCS-WTI differential to
            US$26.30/bbl in 2020. As discounts are gradually alleviated, prices
            discounts converge to a sustained value of US$14/bbl by 2027 that
            reflect quality differences and transportation costs to the Gulf
            Coast.
          </p>
          <p>
            CLS is assumed to strengthen as WTI increases, but its discount will
            increase as production continues to outpace incremental pipeline
            capacity over the next year, reaching a high of US$7.69/bbl in 2019.
            The differential will narrow as capacity additions are assumed to
            come online gradually thereafter, reaching a long-term value of
            US$2.60/bbl with WTI in 2027<sup id="fn7-rf"

            Figure 2.3 shows the Brent price assumptions for the Reference, High
            and Low Price Cases. The High Price Case presents a future where
            supply is not as robust and prices need to rise to levels around
            US$120/bbl to balance crude oil markets in the longer term. The Low
            Price Case reflects an environment where supply availability is more
            robust and begins to outpace demand growth, sending prices to
            $40/bbl in the long term.

          <h3>Current Context</h3>
          <p>
            North American natural gas prices have declined considerably over
            the past decade. Lower prices have been driven by large increases in
            production, made possible by horizontal drilling and multistage
            hydraulic fracturing.
            <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#henryhubprice">Henry Hub prices</a>
            averaged US$7.80 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2008,
            and declined by almost 50% by 2013. Over the past five years, prices
            have averaged just over US$3.00/MMBtu. From a low of US$2.49/MMBtu
            in 2016, prices have increased through 2017, and averaged
            US$2.89/MMBtu in the first half of 2018. Despite gains in U.S.
            production, much of which has been natural gas produced with oil,
            increased demand and increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports
            from the Gulf of Mexico contributed to moderately recovering prices.
            Figure 2.4 compares historical Alberta (Nova Inventory Transfer
            (NIT)) and Henry Hub prices for the past 10 years.

            <p>
              This chart shows Henry Hub and NIT prices, in nominal USD/MMBtu,
              from 2008 to 2018. Henry Hub price decreased from $7.8/MMBtu in
              2008 to $2.9/MMBtu in 2018. NIT price decreased from $6.99/MMBtu
              in 2008 to $1.3/MMBtu in 2018. The Henry Hub to NIT differential
              fell from $0.8/MMBtu in 2008, to $1.8/MMBtu in 2018.
            </p>
          </details>
          <p>
            From 2010 to 2013, Canadian natural gas prices averaged just under
            C$3/GJ. In 2014, prices briefly rebounded and have since continued
            to decline. Prices averaged C$1.50/GJ in 2017, and C$1.13/GJ in the
            first half of 2018. Canadian natural gas exports were formerly
            priced off Henry Hub, minus the cost of transport. However, rapidly
            rising U.S. production from the Marcellus Basin in Pennsylvania and
            Ohio now represents the competition for much of Canada&rsquo;s
            exports and Marcellus gas sells at a discount to Henry Hub. Canadian
            natural gas production is also being driven by the value of
            condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that are co-produced with
            the gas. This means that some Canadian producers can accept a lower
            price for their natural gas because of the revenues earned from the
            accompanying condensate and NGLs. As production shifts westward in
            western Canada to access the sources richer in condensate and NGLs,
            pipeline capacity has not kept pace with production. Additional
            pipeline capacity is being constructed in those areas. The
            construction can cause interruptions to existing pipeline capacity
            resulting in periods when some gas in western Canada is sold at very
            low or even negative prices to find a market. From 2008 to 2015, the
            average NIT-Henry Hub differential was $0.78/MMBtu, but it averaged
            US$1.50/MMbtu in 2017 and over $1.75/MMBtu for the first six months
            of 2018. NIT even exhibited negative pricing on several days
            throughout 2017 and 2018.

            <p>Factors Currently Affecting Natural Gas Markets:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increased North American production.</li>
              <li>U.S. LNG exports.</li>
              <li>WCSB and export pipeline capacity.</li>

          </div>
          <p>
            As producers in western Canada seek new markets in the U.S. or to
            better compete in existing markets by lowering their costs, pipeline
            operators have been adjusting capacities on pipelines out of the
            region and making arrangements to lower transport costs. To access
            overseas natural gas markets, there are several proposed projects to
            export LNG from Canada&rsquo;s west coast, the economics of which
            have been improving over the past year.
          </p>
          <h3>EF2018 Natural Gas Assumptions</h3>
          <p>
            In the Reference Case, Henry Hub prices remain flat and stay under
            US$3.00/MMBtu until 2025 as the market continues to be in a state of
            over-supply. This is largely due to growing U.S. oil production and
            the natural gas production associated with it. The natural gas price
            is assumed to gradually increase thereafter as U.S. industrial
            demand and LNG exports outpace supply growth, reaching a long-term
            price of US$4.16/MMBtu in 2040.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prospect of Canadian LNG export facilities also has important
            implications for energy supply and demand trends. The future of
            Canadian LNG exports has been uncertain. Globally, LNG trade is
            expected to increase as the demand for natural gas rises by over 45%
            in the next 25 years. Gas markets are expected to be well supplied
            in the near term and new exports will be required by the
            mid-2020s<sup id="fn8-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"
                ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a
              ></sup
            >. The demand increase could prove to be an opportunity for Canadian
            LNG export volumes.
          </p>
          <p>
            All EF2018 Cases assume LNG exports from British Columbia
            (B.C.)&rsquo;s coast beginning in 2025. LNG exports start at 0.75
            billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) (21.3 million cubic metres per
            day (10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d)) in 2025 and double in 2026 to
            reach 1.50 Bcf/d (42.5 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d). Phase II is
            assumed to come online in 2030, increasing total LNG exports to 2.25
            Bcf/d (63.7 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d) in 2030 and 3.0 Bcf/d
            (85.0 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d) in 2031. Figure 2.5 shows the
            assumed LNG export volumes included in EF2018 analysis for all
            Cases. The Canadian LNG export volumes included in this analysis are
            an assumption of what might happen. They do not reflect volumes
            associated with a particular project or export license. On 2
            October, LNG Canada announced a positive final investment decision
            for its proposed export project. The project will initially export
            14 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) (the equivalent of ~1.8 Bcf/d or
            51 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d) from two processing units and will
            have the capability to expand to four in the future. This decision
            came after the EF2018 analysis period was completed. At this point,
            the EF2018 LNG assumptions are considered applicable to any new
            large scale LNG facility, whether it turns out to be the LNG Canada
            project or a competitor. Additional details should become available
            once construction of a project is underway and these can be included
            in future editions of Energy Futures.

            EF2018 assumes that Canadian natural gas price discounts persist in
            the near term and are slowly alleviated by 2025 as infrastructure is
            built and markets for excess natural gas are found. Figure 2.6 shows
            the NIT-Henry Hub differential decreases from its current high of
            US$1.60/MMBtu to US$.90/MMBtu in 2025, bringing NIT to US$2.15/MMBtu
            (C$2.51/GJ). The NIT-Henry Hub differential increases again in 2027
            as producers prepare their reserves and boost production for the
            upcoming phase of LNG exports, reaching US$1.05/MMBtu in 2029, and
            returning to its long-term levels of US$0.90/MMBtu. While the
            differential varies, NIT increases constantly over the Reference
            Case outlook, reaching a value of US$3.26/MMBtu (C$3.69/GJ) by 2040.

          <h2 id="s3">Climate Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Canadian climate policy has evolved rapidly since 2015. Over the
            past several years, all levels of government have made major policy
            announcements and continue to move forward with previously announced
            and implemented climate related plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            EF2018 includes many recently announced and implemented climate
            policies. In order to determine whether a policy was included in the
            analysis, the following criteria were applied:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The policy was publically announced prior to 1 August 2018.</li>
            <li>
              Sufficient details exist to model the policy.<sup id="fn9-rf"

              Goals and targets, including Canada&rsquo;s international climate
              targets, are not explicitly modelled. Rather, policies that are
              announced, and in place, to address those targets are included in
              the modelling and analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            See Table A.1 in Appendix A for a list of some recent climate
            policies and how they are handled in EF2018.
          </p>
          <h3>Carbon Pricing</h3>
          <p>
            Carbon pricing systems continue to evolve in Canada, as various
            provinces and territories have announced their intentions for their
            own carbon pricing systems under the Pan-Canadian Framework. Figure
            2.8 breaks down the EF2018 carbon price assumptions by province from
            2018 to 2025. EF2018 assumes that the Federal backstop carbon price
            is binding in the Reference Case. For provinces that have not
            declared their own carbon pricing system, or have price carbon at a
            level below the backstop schedule, the backstop schedule–beginning
            at $20 per tonne in 2019 and rising to $50 per tonne in 2022–is
            used.
          </p>
          <p>
            For provinces that have chosen cap-and-trade systems, the future
            price of carbon will be determined by the supply and demand for
            emission permits. The outlook for this market price will be
            uncertain, similar to other market prices such as crude oil and
            natural gas. Like crude oil and natural gas prices, EF2018 makes
            simplifying assumptions for the future outlook of carbon pricing.
            For the two cap-and-trade provinces, Quebec and Nova Scotia, the
            carbon price is assumed to remain below the federal backstop in the
            early 2020s, before converging to $50 per tonne in 2025. Post-2025,
            carbon prices in all provinces and territories remain at $50/tonne
            in nominal terms

              This chart shows carbon pricing by province from 2018 to 2025, in
              nominal CND per tonne. In 2018, British Columbia’s carbon price is
              $33.8/t, Alberta’s is $30/t, Manitoba’s is $25/t, and Quebec’s is
              $19.6/t. For the remaining provinces, the carbon price is $0/t in
              2018, increasing by $10 per year, reaching $50/t by 2022, where it
              remains until 2040. For British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba,
              carbon prices also increase to $50/t by 2022. For Quebec, prices
              reach $50/t in 2025.

            <p>
              Many carbon pricing systems have exemptions and/or permit
              allocations. One example is the output based allocation approach
              used for
              <a

                >federal backstop systems</a
              >. This system provides an allowable level of emissions for large
              emitters, and facilities pay for the emissions above that level or
              receive credits for their emissions below it. This system reduces
              the average carbon cost for these facilities, but maintains the
              incentive for emission reductions. In this analysis, emitters face
              the full carbon price at an end-user level to capture the
              incentive effect of the carbon price, while the impact of the
              output based allocations in reducing the overall cost to firms and
              income effects of the carbon prices is captured in the industrial
              macroeconomic projections. Other examples include

            While EF2018 attempts to include available details on current
            climate policies and carbon pricing systems, these systems are
            complex, continually being refined, and involve several
            uncertainties. The primary uncertainty is the federal
            government&rsquo;s jurisdiction to enforce the pan-Canadian
            benchmark for pricing carbon in the event that provinces that have
            not implemented their own plans that meet the minimum standards, or
            are actively opting out of implementing a carbon pricing plan.
            EF2018 makes many simplifying assumptions on Canadian climate policy
            implementation for the purposes of creating a reasonable outlook for
            future Canadian supply and demand trends. It should not be taken as
            direct analysis on any specific policy initiative.

            Canada&rsquo;s energy system is entering a period of significant

              >Pan-Canadian Framework</a
            >, four key areas of transition were identified: growth in
            renewables and low-emitting sources, increasing interconnections to
            allow the flow of clean power, modernizing the electricity system,
            and reducing diesel reliance in remote communities.

            In spring 2016, the Alberta government unveiled a climate change and
            emissions strategy based on recommendations put forth by the Climate
            Leadership Panel. The Alberta government plans to phase out
            coal-fired electricity generation by 2030. However, this could take
            place earlier than planned through coal-to-gas conversions. In 2017,
            two operators announced their plans to retrofit existing coal units
            to natural gas-fired units as early as 2020. The strategy also calls
            for the development of 5&nbsp;000 megawatts (MW) of renewables by
            2030. To reach this target the Alberta Electricity System
            Operator&rsquo;s (AESO) launched the first

            Remote communities primarily rely on expensive diesel-fired
            generation, while others rely on smaller local or regional
            electricity grids based on hydro or trucked-in liquefied natural gas
            (LNG). Many remote communities in northern Canada are exploring
            opportunities to reduce their reliance on diesel fuel, improve
            electricity reliability, and reduce emissions.

            currently exist in many Northwest Territories communities although
            they tend to have limited functionality in the winter months due to
            reduced sunlight in the region. Despite this limitation, over
            900&nbsp;kilowatts (kW) of installed solar PV capacity helped offset

          <p>
            Technology&rsquo;s influence on the energy system can range from
            marginal to transformative. Which emerging technologies will achieve
            widespread use is often difficult to predict. Likewise, the nature
            of future breakthroughs is unknown. The adoption rate of emerging
            technologies is a key uncertainty to the projections in EF2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core Cases assume moderate technological progress, reflected by
            factors such as efficiency improvements and cost reductions for
            well-established technologies. However, there is a high degree of
            potential for further technological progress, especially as it
            relates to the increasing ambition of climate policies across the
            world and the transition to a low carbon economy. These types of
            changes pose several key uncertainties for Canada&rsquo;s energy
            system, and are explored in the EF2018 Technology Case. There is
            also potential for disruptive technologies to emerge, altering the
            ways Canadians use energy. They could result in both increases and
            decreases in energy usage for a variety of end-uses<sup id="fn12-rf"

                  From April through June 2018, oil prices appeared to hover
                  within a narrow range in the US$70s/bbl at a real price level
                  that is close to the 20-year average of US$66. In July 2018,
                  Brent averaged over US$74/bbl, a 53% increase over levels seen
                  a year earlier.

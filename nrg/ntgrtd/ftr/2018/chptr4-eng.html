            EF2018&rsquo;s Technology Case explores how a global shift towards
            low carbon energy technologies could impact future Canadian energy
            supply and demand trends. Canada is a relatively energy intensive
            economy<sup id="fn18-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn18"
                ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>18</a
              ></sup
            >, and a major producer of many forms of energy. This potential
            shift is an important uncertainty for Canadian energy projections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Technology Case assumes that countries across the world
            increasingly adopt new technologies and increase their actions to
            combat climate change, as outlined in the
            <a
              href="http://www.iea.org/media/weowebsite/2017/Chap1_WEO2017.pdf"
              rel="external"
              >IEA&rsquo;s World Energy Outlook 2017 &ldquo;Sustainable
              Development Scenario&rdquo;</a
            >. This global shift has implications for energy markets such as
            crude oil and natural gas. Canadian energy supply and demand trends
            are influenced by this global context, as well as specific
            assumptions on cost reductions and adoption for new technologies in
            Canada. The Technology Case is designed to explore a key uncertainty
            for the future of Canada&rsquo;s energy system, a faster transition
            to a lower carbon economy driven by increasing global climate action

          <p>
            Various technology, policy, and social trends over the past decade
            point to the potential for a global shift towards a lower carbon
            economy. This section outlines several examples of these trends.

          <p>
            Falling costs and increased deployment of renewable electricity
            sources, like wind and solar, have been an important technology
            change. Figure 4.1 shows global wind and solar generation. Over the
            last decade, wind and solar power have increased substantially,
            initially led by the European Union and the U.S., with recent growth
            in China and Japan. Many global forecasting agencies see this trend

              This graph shows global solar and wind generation by country from
              1997 to 2017. In 1997 total global wind and solar generation was

            Technology and policy changes are transforming the transportation
            sector. Many forecasting agencies expect growth in refined oil
            products demand (gasoline) to slow or decline compared to historical
            trends. These changes are a key reason the concept of &quot;peak
            demand&quot;–the year at which global demand for oil will reach its
            maximum–is currently a key discussion point in oil markets. Reasons
            for this trend include increasing fuel economy, increased biofuel
            blending, and possible increase of EV adoption.

            Emerging climate policies and future low carbon energy technologies
            are highly integrated. As an example of increasing momentum for
            policy action to reduce carbon emissions, Figure 4.2 shows that over
            the last decade the number of carbon pricing systems in the world
            increased from 10 to 46, while the coverage of those systems
            increased from 4% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 14%. Carbon
            pricing systems scheduled to come into effect soon, led by
            China&rsquo;s planned emission trading system, will bring this to
            over 50 systems covering nearly 20% of emissions by 2020<sup

          <p>
            The Technology Case is based on a set of global and Canadian
            assumptions around energy markets, energy and climate policy, and
            adoption of low carbon technologies. Figure 4.3 illustrates the

              <strong>Global Assumptions:</strong> Includes energy market price
              assumptions for global crude oil and North American natural gas,
              economy-wide carbon pricing, and other general policy trends.
              These global assumptions are aligned with the

              targets, shows a steep decline in emissions from 2020 to 2040,
              putting the world on track to hold the increase of global average
              temperatures to below 2 degrees. It does so while also balancing
              other sustainable development goals, in particular, increasing
              access to modern energy sources and reducing local air pollution.

              of alternative fuels, and Canadian benchmark oil and gas prices.
              These Canadian-specific assumptions are chosen to be consistent

              EF2018&rsquo;s global assumptions are aligned with the IEA&rsquo;s
              Sustainable Development Scenario, which reflect a world on track
              to meet commitments made under the Paris climate agreement. The
              assumptions and outcomes of the Technology Case are broadly
              consistent with the type of outcomes expected in such a
              transition: declining fossil fuels use, increasing use of
              non-emitting fuels, increased energy efficiency, and emergence of
              new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, EF2018 and the Technology Case are strictly focused on
              Canada. Since climate change is a global issue, it is difficult to
              assess global climate implications without undertaking an
              integrated global climate modeling exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Technology Case illustrates what a broad shift towards a low
              carbon energy system might look like for Canada. It is not a
              recommended pathway towards achieving Paris climate a greement
              goals, or Canada&rsquo;s own GHG emission targets. ECCC produces
              the official analysis of Canada&rsquo;s current emission outlook

            <li>
              <strong>Carbon Pricing:</strong> The IEA Sustainable Development
              Scenario shows a shift to a low carbon future that is driven by a
              broad set of policy assumptions, as well as the integration of a
              higher share of low carbon energy sources and technologies into
              the global energy mix. Carbon pricing provides a key driver for
              change across the economy. A rising carbon price is assumed for
              both OECD and non-OECD economies. Figure 4.4 shows the Technology
              Case assumption for Canada, aligned to the IEA&rsquo;s OECD carbon
              price increase.

              <strong>Other actions:</strong> In addition to carbon pricing, the
              IEA outlines several high-level policy initiatives by sector,
              including efficiency regulations, support for alternative fuels,

              U.S. natural gas price. It increases from $3.25/MMbtu in 2030 to
              $3.66/MMbtu in 2040. This reflects growing demand for natural gas
              to replace coal for power generation. However, the IEA projects
              that global natural gas demand will grow at a slower rate in this
              case compared to other scenarios. The Technology Case reflects
              this dynamic; in 2030 it is $0.30/MMBtu lower than the Reference
              Case and in 2040 is $0.50/MMbtu lower than the Reference Case
              (Figure 4.6).

              <strong>End-use Fuel Prices:</strong> Canadian end-use prices are
              affected by the carbon price and benchmark crude oil and natural
              gas price trends. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices put
              downward pressure on prices for refined products and delivered
              natural gas. Increased carbon pricing puts upward pressure on
              prices, based on the relative carbon intensity of fuels. Table 4.1
              provides example carbon prices of various fuels in energy
              equivalent and volumetric terms.

              <strong>Canadian Benchmark Prices:</strong> The Technology Case
              assumes that the differentials between benchmark prices shown in
              Chapter 2 for the Reference Case are the same in the Technology
              Case. This implies a Technology WCS and CLS price $11/bbl lower
              than the Reference Case in 2040, and a NIT price $0.50/MMBtu lower
              in 2040. Given the global context, this is a very uncertain
              assumption. As the globe shifts towards a low carbon economy,
              market dynamics may evolve differently and lead to different
              relationships between the various benchmark prices in the short or
              long term.

              <strong>LNG Export Assumptions:</strong> The Technology Case
              assumes LNG export volumes are the same as the Reference Case.
              This is an area of uncertainty as well. Many dynamics will
              influence potential Canadian LNG exports, including economics,
              individual company investment decisions, and the role of natural
              gas globally in switching away from more carbon-intensive fuels
              like coal. LNG export assumptions are a key uncertainty in all
              EF2018 cases, and could be higher or lower than assumed both
              compared to the assumptions, and relative to each other.

              <strong>Solar and Wind Levelized Cost Reductions: </strong>Figure
              4.8 compares levelized costs of wind and solar power, which is the
              cost per MW.h of generation. It shows that falling capital costs
              drive generation costs for these resources. Levelized costs
              include the amount of generation each kW of capacity produces, or
              the capacity factor. In Canada, wind power generally operates at a
              higher capacity factor than solar. This implies that wind, on
              average, has a lower cost per MW.h generated than solar, even with

              in both cases, although the decline is faster for the Technology
              case for both wind and solar. Solar costs begin at around 131 2016
              C$/MWh and fall to 82 by 2040 in the Reference Case and 69 in the
              Technology Case. Wind costs fall from 55 2016 C$/MWh to 45 in the

              <strong>Integrating Variable Renewables:</strong> The Technology
              Case assumes enhanced integration of wind and solar power into
              electricity grids. This includes additional electricity
              transmission between Canadian provinces, and a greater use of

              renewable generation.

                <strong>Flexible generation:</strong> Generation sources like
                hydro and natural gas can be ramped up when solar and wind
                generation declines, or down when it increases.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transmission:</strong> Variable generation is location
                specific. Increased transmission from areas where wind
                generation is higher can help smooth out the variability of the
                resource, or connect the region to additional flexible
                generation. Recent analysis found transmission to be a key

                possibly be adjusted to better align with generation. As end
                uses become increasingly digitized, renewables could be better
                integrated for both large scale loads, and smaller scale
                integration at the household level.<sup id="fnc-rf"

                <strong>Storage:</strong> Grid-scale storage includes many
                technologies like pumped hydro, batteries, compressed air and
                flywheels. Storage can help balance the electricity system by
                charging and discharging as wind and solar levels fluctuate.
                Recently, there is increasing interest in battery storage, given
                decreasing costs. The learning rate of battery storage–the
                percentage costs have fallen for every doubling of global
                battery storage capacity–has been at similar levels to solar

              Since this Case assumes the world is moving towards widespread
              action on climate change, current Canadian measures to avoid
              adverse competitiveness issues, or carbon leakage, are phased out
              by 2035. This includes the output based allocations (OBAs) used in

              <strong>Solvent Technology for In Situ Production:</strong> The
              Technology Case assumes widespread adoption of solvent technology
              for oil sands in situ production. Steam solvent technology is
              applied to all new production by 2025, as well as some existing
              reservoirs, resulting in a 25% reduction in SOR. By 2030, pure
              solvent technology reaches wide-scale commercial adoption, and all
              new production employs this technology, leading to an 80%
              reduction in SOR.<br />
              Figure 4.9 illustrates this incentive to reduce the carbon
              emissions in the Technology Case. The first chart shows the
              theoretical carbon cost per barrel in the Technology Case assuming
              OBAs are phased out, carbon price rises, and emission intensity of
              production remains at 2016 levels. Given the oil prices shown
              earlier, these costs would become a major impediment to production
              economics. The second chart shows that 25% and 80% SOR reductions
              from steam and pure solvent technology, respectively, can reduce
              those costs significantly.

            <p>
              These technologies involve displacing the steam that is injected
              to produce oil with solvents, lowering natural gas requirements to
              generate the steam, and therefore the emissions intensity of
              production. Both steam and pure solvents are emerging technologies
              that have been under development for a number of years. An in situ
              project using steam-solvent technology can have higher upfront
              costs than a traditional in situ project as a result of additional
              facilities to store, treat, and recover solvents<sup id="fna1-rf"

              offset those costs to varying extents depending on individual
              project characteristics. Pure solvents also offer the potential
              for capital cost reductions<sup id="fnb1-rf"

              These two graphs show the incentives that companies face to reduce
              carbon emissions in the Technology Case while assuming
              output-based allocations are phased out completely by 2035. The
              first illustrates the theoretical carbon costs per barrel of oil,
              which assumes no reduction in the SOR, increases from 2 C$/bbl in
              2018 to 23.5 in 2040. The relief provided by Output Based
              Allocations (OBA’s) begins as 1.7 C$/bbl in 2018 and is phased out
              in 2035.

            <p>
              The second shows that steam oil ratio reductions from improved
              technology can greatly reduce these costs. If these ratios are
              reduced by 80% then compliance costs will by 4.7 C$/bbl compared
              to 23.5 with no reductions by 2040. If these ratios are reduced by
              25% then compliance costs will be 0.6 C$/bbl with 5.4 C$/bbl
              covered by OBA relief by 2040.

              Northern Territories and remote communities have unique energy
              contexts with higher costs due to fuel transportation costs,
              colder climates, and reduced energy options,

              the Pan-Canadian Framework. The 2018 Energy and Mines Ministers
              Conference featured items on adopting renewables and reliability,
              as well as integrating new technology in remote communities.

              Given these unique energy issues, the Technology Case includes
              some specific assumptions for Northern Territories. The Technology
              Case assumes an increase in solar and wind power over the longer
              term, offsetting large amounts of diesel generation in the summer
              months. For space heating, current trends towards increasing
              biomass use are strengthened. On the energy use side, the Case
              assumes a lower adoption of EVs and heat pumps compared to the
              other provinces, but similar improvements in energy efficiency.

            outlook in many ways. Figure 4.16 highlights four key shifts in the
            energy system:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Total energy use declines:</strong> Compared to 2017
              levels, total Canadian energy consumption is nearly 20% lower in
              2040 despite similar total GDP and population trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >The share of renewable and non-emitting energy
                increases:</strong
              >
              Fossil fuel use falls faster than total energy demand, and by 2040
              fossil fuel demand is 30% lower than 2017 levels. More efficient
              processes and technologies, as well as switching to renewable
              energy, cause this trend.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >By 2040, energy use per capita is reduced by one third, energy
                use per $ of GDP is nearly cut in half:</strong
              >
              Economic and population growth become further decoupled from
              energy use, as Canadian homes and businesses use energy more
              efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Prices and technologies will shape Canada&rsquo;s role in
                supplying oil and gas in a transitioning world: </strong
              >Canadian oil and gas production will be influenced by their
              ability to reduce costs and emissions. Technologies such as
              solvent-based injection for oil sands production provide an
              opportunity to maintain production, while market prices are a key
              uncertainty.

              The top left figure shows how total energy use changes in the
              Reference and Technology Cases from 2015 to 2040. Energy use
              increases from 13,300 PJ in 2015 to 14,200 in 2040. In the
              Technology Case total use decreases to 11,100 PJ with 4,100 made
              up of non-emitting fuels and renewables and the remaining 7,000
              consisting of fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chart on the top right shows the change in primary energy use
              by fuel. Fossil fuel use falls from 10,000 PJ in 2017 to 8,900 in
              2030 and, 7,100 in 2040. Renewables and non-emitting resource use
              increases from 3,400 in 2017 to 3,800 in 2030 and, 4,100 in 2040.
              The graph on the bottom left shows the change in energy intensity
              in 2040 relative to 2017 in terms of energy use per $ GDP and
              energy use per person. Energy use per GDP falls 44% by 2040 and
              energy use per person falls by 31%.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chart on the bottom right shows crude oil production in the
              four cases from 2015 to 2040. In the Reference Case production
              climbs from 4 MMb/d to 6.9 in 2040. In the High Price Case it
              climbs to 9.1 MMb/d. In the Technology Case production peaks in
              2029 at 5.9 MMb/d then falls to 5.8 in 2040. In the Low Price Case
              it peaks at 5.0 MMb/d in 2021 before falling to 3.8 in 2040.

          <h2 id="s6">Macroeconomic Drivers</h2>
          <p>
            Most macroeconomic drivers are similar between the Reference and
            Technology Case (Table 4.2). This is driven by improved technologies
            reducing energy use costs, but also several important assumptions.
            The Technology Case assumes global growth is the same as the
            Reference Case, including that of key trading partners. Revenues
            from the higher degree of carbon pricing in the case is recycled
            back into the economy through personal and corporate tax cuts. These
            factors result in small differences between macroeconomic trends
            between the Reference and Technology cases at the national level.

              This chart shows the change in end use energy demand from 2017 to
              2040 in the residential, commercial, industrial, and
              transportation sectors in both the Reference and Technology Cases.
              In the residential sector 2017 demand is 1450 PJ and increases to
              1550 in the Reference Case but falls to 1230 in the Technology
              Case. Commercial demand begins at 1360 PJ and rises to 1570 in the
              Reference Case while falling to 1210 in the Technology Case. The
              industrial sector sees a rise from 6010 PJ to 6820 in the
              Reference Case and a decrease to 4970 in the Technology Case. And
              in the transportation sector use falls from 2620 PJ to 2430 in the
              Reference Case and 2090 in the Technology Case.

          <h3>Residential and Commercial</h3>
          <p>
            Improving efficiency and increased electrification via high
            efficiency heat pumps leads to residential and commercial demands
            being 15% and 11% lower in 2040 than their 2017 levels,
            respectively. Figure 4.18 shows residential and commercial demand by
            energy source in the Technology Case.
          </p>
          <p>
            When heat pumps replace natural gas heating, they lead to higher
            electricity use, although at lower levels than the natural gas they
            are displacing. However, when heat pumps replace electric baseboard
            heating or conventional air conditioning, this reduces electricity
            demand. Appliance efficiency improvements put further downward
            pressure on electricity requirements. Overall, despite
            electrification, annual electricity demands are similar to Reference
            Case levels. Given that demands for other heating fuels fall faster
            than electricity in the Technology Case, electricity makes up a
            growing share of residential and commercial building demands .

              The chart on the left shows the change in residential energy
              demand by source from 2015 to 2040 in the Technology Case. Oil
              demand decreases from 82 PJ to 43. Natural gas demand falls from
              677 PJ to 410. Electricity demand stays constant at 606 PJ.
              Biofuels demand increases from 157 PJ to 173. The second chart
              shows the energy demand in the commercial sector over the same
              period. Here oil demand falls from 216 PJ to 166. Natural gas
              demand falls 675 PJ to 417. Electricity demand rises from 453 PJ
              to 573 PJ. And Biofuels demand rises from 0 PJ to 46.

          <p>
            In the transportation sector, increased use of biofuels and
            electricity diversifies the fuel mix of the sector that has long
            been dominated by oil-based petroleum products. Energy efficiency
            improvements for all forms of travel also reduce energy
            requirements. Figure 4.19 illustrates the transportation sector
            energy mix in the Technology Case.

              Diesel consumption falls from 804 PJ to 615. Jet fuel slightly
              declines from 274 PJ to 205. Demand for other oil products slows
              from 44 PJ to 25. Natural gas demand increases from 15 PJ to 66.
              Electricity demand sees a dramatic rise from 3 PJ to 164. And

            Increased EV penetration adds approximately 120&nbsp;PJ, or over
            30&nbsp;TW.h, of annual electricity use by 2040. This reduces a
            relatively higher amount of gasoline and diesel, as EVs typically
            use less energy per km travelled compared to conventional vehicles.
            Improved vehicle efficiency and biofuel blending further reduces
            demand for these fuels. Relative to the Reference Case by 2040,
            Figure 4.20 shows that the Technology Case adds nearly 230&nbsp;PJ
            of electricity and biofuels, which is more than offset by a
            570&nbsp;PJ decrease in petroleum product demand.

              difference in demand between the cases for all fuels is less than
              5 PJ in 2020 but grows over the projection period. Gasoline demand
              is 359 PJ higher, diesel demand is 92 PJ higher, jet fuel is 103
              PJ higher, and other fossil fuel demand is 16 PJ in the Reference
              Case. While biofuels and electricity demand are 108 and 118 PJ

          <h3>Industrial</h3>
          <p>
            Figure 4.21 shows industrial demand in the Technology Case by fuel.
            This reflects changes in energy use in both the oil and gas
            production sector as well as other industrial sectors. By 2040,
            industrial energy use is nearly 15% lower than 2017 levels, and 20%
            lower than the Reference Case. This is due to lower oil and gas
            production that is produced using less energy, as well as improved
            processes in other energy intensive industrial sectors.

            and declining demand for oil. Markets and infrastructure uncertainty
            are reflected in Canadian price discounts, which are the same as the
            Reference Case. In this smaller, and therefore increasingly
            competitive, global market for oil and gas, crude oil and natural
            gas production are lower than the Reference Case. By 2040,
            Technology Case crude oil production is 15% lower than Reference
            Case levels, and natural gas production is over 30% lower. However,
            production in the Technology Case is higher than the Low Price Case,
            highlighting the importance of market dynamics in future production
            trends.

              The chart on the left shows crude oil production in the four cases
              from 2015 to 2040. In the Reference Case production climbs from 4
              MMb/d to 6.9 in 2040. In the High Price Case it climbs to 9.1
              MMb/d. In the Technology Case production peaks in 2029 at 5.9
              MMb/d then falls to 5.8 in 2040. In the Low Price Case it peaks at
              5.0 MMb/d in 2021 before falling to 3.8 in 2040.

              and reaches 27 Bcf/d by the same date. In the Low Price Case gas
              production peaks in 2018 at 16 Bcf/d, then falls to 12.5. In the

            The key technology assumption of steam solvents being widely
            deployed by 2025 and pure solvents by 2030 has two main effects on
            oil sand producers. First, the technology creates a production
            uplift, so more oil is produced using the technology than standard
            steam injection, possibly up to 30%. Second, the technology reduces
            SORs. Figure 4.23 shows in situ production and SOR trends. In the
            medium term, technology improvements dominate market impacts, and
            Technology Case production is higher than the Reference Case until
            2030. Over the longer term, lower prices and higher costs of carbon
            emissions cause Technology Case in situ production trends to flatten
            out. By 2040, in situ production in the Technology Case is nearly
            10% lower than the Reference Case, but still higher than current
            levels.

              The chart on the left illustrates oil sands in situ production
              from 2015 to 2040 in the Technology and Reference Cases. In the
              Technology Case production increases from about 1.4 MMb/d in 2015
              to around 2.6 in 2028 where it remains relatively stable with only
              minor increases through 2040. In the Reference Case production
              climbs continuously and reaches 2.8 MMb/d in 2040.

              The figure on the right shows the projected steam oil ratio (SOR)
              used for in situ production in the Technology and Reference Cases
              from 2015 until 2040. The SOR remains constant for both at close
              to 3 until 2024, when they diverge. After this point the
              Technology Case drops to 1.4 by 2040 and the Reference Case drops
              to 2.4.

            Another key factor is the relative lifetimes of oil sands projects
            versus other production types. Figure 4.24 shows production broken
            down by oil sands mining, in situ, and other production. Because of
            their long lifetimes, extremely low decline rates, and low
            per-barrel marginal costs of production, oil sands facilities
            continue to produce near current levels, with solvent-fueled
            technology leading to increases in production. Other forms of
            production, such as conventional and tight light oil, have shorter
            capital investment cycles, and are projected to be more responsive
            to global shifts in demand.

          <h2 id="s9">Electricity Generation</h2>
          <p>
            In the Technology Case, electricity generation is moderately higher
            than the Reference Case, reflecting improvements to energy
            efficiency roughly balancing additional electric demands from uses
            such as electric vehicles. In this case, Canada&rsquo;s already
            low-emitting grid reduces its emission intensity even further.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Technology Case, electric generating capacity is 26% higher
            than 2017 levels. Hydro still dominates Canada&rsquo;s capacity mix,
            and the combined capacity of wind and solar more than triples in the
            Technology Case, due to assumed lower costs and improved
            integration. In the Technology Case, wind and solar make up over 25%
            of Canada&rsquo;s capacity mix in 2040, compared to just over 10% in
            2017. Figure 4.25 shows total electric capacity by fuel in 2005 and
            2017 and in the Technology Case for 2030 and 2040.

              Technology Case in 2005, 2017, 2030, and 2040. In 2005 coal
              generation capacity was 15.5 GW, which fell to 9.3 in 2017, and is
              projected to continue falling to 2.0 in 2030 and 1.4 in 2040.
              Natural gas capacity increased from 13.6 GW in 2005 to 21.8 in
              2017. In 2030 it increases to 30.9, then falls to 29.6 in 2040.
              Oil capacity continually falls from 4.7 GW in 2005 to 3.3 in 2040.
              Nuclear increased from 12.8 GW in 2005 to 13.3 in 2017, but is
              projected to fall to 10.2 in 2030 then increase 11.1 in 2040.
              Hydro capacity increases throughout the period from 72.9 GW in
              2005 to 89.3 in 2040. Biofuels increase from 1.7 GW in 2005 to 3.4
              in 2040. Wind capacity grows from 0.7 GW in 2005 to 13.7 in 2017,
              27.2 in 2030, then to 34.0 in 2040. Solar also sees big gains and
              grows from 0 GW installed capacity in 2005, to 2.8 in 2017, 6.3 in
              2030, and 13.7 in 2040.

            Electric generation is 12% higher than 2017 levels by 2040. Relative
            to the Reference Case, capacity grows more than generation in the
            Technology Case because most of the additions are wind and solar.
            Wind and solar tend to generate less per MW of capacity compared to
            other sources of electricity. While wind and solar make up 25% of
            capacity in 2040, these resources account for 17% of generation.
            Figure 4.26 shows electricity generation by source in the Technology
            Case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electricity generation varies significantly by province. For hydro
            generating provinces, the electricity mix is relatively similar to
            the Reference Case, with small levels of wind and solar added due to
            lower costs. For other provinces, wind and solar become an
            increasingly large part of the mix. These resources are backed up
            with natural gas as well as increased interchange and demand side
            management.

            Canada wide, the share of renewables and nuclear electricity
            generation reaches 90% by 2040. This compares to 84% in the
            Reference Case, and 82% in 2017. These annual figures can be
            misleading, as electric loads vary significantly during the day, as
            does available energy from variable sources like wind and solar. How
            these sources are matched with changes in electricity demands from
            end-users is an important uncertainty.

          <p>
            The Technology Case implies a significant reduction in total primary
            energy demand, as well as a shift towards relatively more
            non-emitting energy. These changes will reduce Canada&rsquo;s GHG
            emission trajectory, as less fossil fuels are combusted and more
            carbon is captured and sequestered. Figure 4.27 shows total primary
            energy demand by fuel. In the near term, energy use peaks and then
            begins to decline, with energy demand in 2025 2 to 3% lower than
            2017 levels. Post 2025, end-use electrification reduces direct
            fossil fuel use, improved efficiency reduces demands for all types
            of energy, and the electricity mix includes a greater share of
            renewable energy. Total primary energy use declines by over 1% per
            year from 2025 to 2040. By 2040, total demand is over 15% lower than
            2017 levels, while fossil fuel use drops even faster to 30% below
            2017 levels.

            energy demand growth. Energy use per capita, on the other hand, has
            remained relatively flat. The Technology Case represents a further

            Compared to the Reference Case, the Technology Case uses more
            renewable energy and less fossil fuels (Figure 4.29). Renewable
            additions include wind and solar for electricity generation,
            increased biofuel blending in transportation, and increased use of
            RNG in the natural gas mix. Fossil fuel reductions are due to fuel
            switching towards biofuels or electricity at the end use level,
            relatively less natural gas used to generate electricity, and
            efficiency and process changes that require less energy, such as the
            adoption of solvent technology in the oil sands or heat pumps in
            buildings.

              This figure compares the change in primary energy demand by fuel
              type between the Reference and Technology Cases from 2015 to 2040.
              In 2040 coal use in the Technology Case is 58 PJ lower than in the
              Reference Case. Oil use is also 1068 PJ lower in the Technology
              Case by 2040, and natural gas use is 2368 PJ lower. Renewables on
              the other hand are 467 PJ higher in the Technology Case by 2040.

            The Technology Case shows that in a transitioning global energy
            context, Canada&rsquo;s energy mix will transition as well. Figure
            4.30 illustrates the change in coal, oil product, and natural gas
            demand in five year increments over the projection. The near term
            shows trends for increasing fossil fuel use in Canada reversing,
            largely driven by coal retirements and improved vehicle efficiency
            reducing oil product demand. Natural gas increases in the near term
            due to its role in oil production, heating, and replacing some of
            the initial coal retirements. In the longer term, new technologies
            and strengthening policies reduce demand for all three, such that
            every five years fossil fuel demand drops by about 10%.

              This chart shows the change in fossil fuel demand broken down into
              5 year increments in the Technology Case. From 2015-2020 oil and
              coal demand fall by 43 PJ and 83 respectively, while gas rises by
              419 resulting in a net increase of 3%. In 2020-2025 oil and coal
              demand fall by 93 and 312 PJ, while gas demand increases by 104
              PJ. The result is a net decrease of 3%. From 2025 to 2030 oil,
              natural gas, and coal fall by 361 PJ, 495, and 159. This results
              in a net decrease of 11%. From 2030 to 2035 oil, natural gas, and
              coal fall by 340 PJ, 610, and 15. This results in a net decrease
              of 11%. From 2035 to 2040 oil, coal, and natural gas fall by 325
              PJ, 494, and 13. This results in a net decrease of 11%.

            The combination of reduced coal, as well as increased CCS, reduces
            the GHG intensity of the fossil fuel mix, putting further downward
            pressure on Canadian GHG emissions. Figure 4.31 compares estimated
            fossil fuel GHG emissions intensity for the Reference and Technology
            case.

              This chart shows the projected changes in fossil fuel GHG emission
              intensity in the Reference and Technology Cases from 2005 to 2040.
              Both the Reference Case and Technology Case begin with an
              intensity of 63 gCO2e/MJ. The Reference Case then declines to 56
              gCO2e/MJ, while the Technology Case falls to 49 gCO2e/MJ by 2040.

          <h3>Key Uncertainties</h3>
          <p>
            The Technology Case provides one snapshot of what a global shift
            towards a low carbon economy might mean for Canada. Future
            development of both policies and technologies could lead to
            different outcomes than those presented in this analysis.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Global context:</strong> How the global context affects
              global energy markets and investment is a key uncertainty that is
              important for the oil and gas projections. In the case of oil,
              <a
                href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-018-2206-2"
                rel="external"
                >others have suggested that falling global oil demand would mean
                a lower price than the Technology Case assumes</a
              >. This could bring Canadian production trends closer to the Low
              Price Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Differentials and infrastructure:</strong> Regional price
              differentials and infrastructure developments are generally
              assumed to be similar to Reference Case levels in the Technology
              Case. These are all highly uncertain areas however. Both oil and
              gas differentials could be different than assumed here, as could
              impact future project developments like LNG.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lower technology costs:</strong> The Technology Case
              assumes that costs of new technologies such as wind, solar, and
              batteries will continue to fall in the longer term. If these
              reductions do not occur, it is likely the adoption of these
              technologies will be lower.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increased end-use electricity:</strong> As part of the
              Technology Case, many end-use applications switch to electricity.
              Although the overall results of the Technology Case show similar
              electricity demand with the Reference Case as improved efficiency
              balances additional demand sources, there are many uncertainties
              with this result. First, depending on the distribution of electric
              loads throughout the day, or season, there may be additional
              challenges for the electric grid. Second, other scenarios see
              electricity increasing<sup id="fn26-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"
                  ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a
                ></sup
              >
              as additional load requirements may not be offset by improved
              efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technological innovation:</strong> There are many details
              that are not covered in this analysis, which is based on
              relatively high level trends. As new technologies are adopted, the
              integration of energy supply and demand will likely become more
              and more important. Innovation will be necessary across the entire
              spectrum of the energy system–consuming and producing
              technologies, market and policy design, and public involvement in
              energy system issues– to ensure Canadians&rsquo; energy needs are
              met in a reliable and affordable way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disruptive technologies:</strong> The EF2018 Technology
              Case generally assumes gradual adoption of new technologies.
              Faster changes and disruptive technologies could alter the way
              Canadians use and produce energy, resulting in primary energy
              demand that is lower or higher in any of the cases presented in
              this report.

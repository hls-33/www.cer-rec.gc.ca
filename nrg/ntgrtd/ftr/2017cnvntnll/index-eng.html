          <p>
            The National Energy Board&rsquo;s (NEB) Energy Futures (EF) series
            explores how possible energy futures might unfold for Canadians over
            the long term. EF analysis considers a range of impacts across the
            entire Canadian energy system. In order to cover all aspects of
            Canadian energy in one supply and demand outlook, crude oil and
            natural gas production analysis can only be addressed at a
            relatively high level. Supplemental crude oil and natural gas
            production analyses address impacts specific to the supply sector,
            creating an opportunity to provide additional detail and to expand
            the number of cases to cover greater volatility in crude oil and
            natural gas prices and in supply-side technology assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future oil prices are a key driver of future oil production and a
            key uncertainty to the projections in the
            <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017/index-eng.html"
              >Canada&rsquo;s Energy Future 2017: Energy Supply and Demand
              Projections to 2040</a

            (EF2017). Crude oil prices could be higher or lower depending on
            demand, technology, geopolitical events, and the pace at which
            nations enact policies to reduce GHG emissions.

            EF analysis assumes that over the long term all energy produced,
            given the pricing conditions of the case, will find markets and
            infrastructure will be built as needed to move that energy to
            markets. The timing and extent to which particular markets emerge,
            whether demand growth over/undershoots local production, whether
            export/import opportunities arise, and whether new infrastructure
            for crude oil is built, are difficult to predict. This is why
            simplifying assumptions are made. The analysis in this supplemental
            report continues the EF tradition of assuming these short-term
            disconnects are resolved over the longer term.

            followed by results from the other five cases. The acceleration in
            technological advances that applies to energy supply in the

            production technologies with no changes to other oil production
            technology assumptions. Oil price assumptions in the High Price Case
            and Low Price Case differ significantly from the other four cases.

              years compared to 2010 to 2014, leading to a decline in total
              production. Starting this year, prices are expected to gradually
              increase and reach US$80/bbl in 2027 for Brent crude. Western
              Canadian industry activity will pick up as oil prices rise and
              this will eventually lead to production increasing as production
              added from new wells starts to outpace declining production from
              existing wells. Production in western Canada in 2016 was 154
              thousand cubic metres per day (10&sup3;m&sup3;/d) or
              0.97&nbsp;million barrels per day (MMb/d) and by 2040 it will be
              36% higher at 210&nbsp;10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (1.32&nbsp;MMb/d).

              This graph breaks down the Reference Case projection for Canadian
              conventional, tight, and shale oil production by province, and
              also includes the Brent crude oil price. British Columbia oil
              production is projected to decrease from 23.08&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016
              to 21.10&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Alberta production is projected to
              increase from 445.33&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016 to 504.24&nbsp;Mb/d in
              2040. Saskatchewan is projected to increase from 459.45&nbsp;Mb/d
              in 2016 to 780.14&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Manitoba is projected to
              decrease from 40.08&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016 to 15.44&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040.
              Newfoundland is projected to decrease from 209.66&nbsp;Mb/d in
              2016 to 101.81&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Production for the rest of
              Canada is projected to decrease from 9.78&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016 to
              4.05&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Total Canadian production is projected to
              increase from 1187.40&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016 to 1426.78&nbsp;Mb/d in
              2040. The Brent crude oil price, in 2016 U.S. dollars per barrel,
              is projected to increase from $43.50 in 2016 to $80.00 in 2027 and
              remain at $80.00 to the end of 2040.

              2016 was the first year that Saskatchewan production surpassed
              Alberta non-oil sands production. This continues over the
              projection period and by 2040 Saskatchewan makes up 55% of total
              production. Saskatchewan production growth largely comes from
              thermal heavy oil projects (section 2.3 provides more details).<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              British Columbia (B.C.) and Manitoba produce minor amounts of both
              conventional and tight oil. The provincial breakdowns are in the
              next section. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Conventional oil is produced elsewhere in Canada. Newfoundland and
              Labrador offshore oil production increases steadily over the next
              five years as the Hebron project begins production and additional
              wells are brought online at existing facilities. After peaking at
              49 10&sup3;m&sup3; /d (309&nbsp;Mb/d) by 2023, production begins
              to decline as operating fields mature. The Reference Case assumes
              that two generic offshore discoveries add new production starting
              in 2027 and 2033. Northern Canada and Ontario oil production
              continues to trend down over the projection period. Nova Scotia
              has condensate production, which is not included in this report.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Since 2000, production by class of non-oil sands oil ranged from
              49% to 58% heavy, with the remainder light<sup id="fn3-rf"

              >. In 2016, heavy oil made up 54% of production and is projected
              to climb to 59% in 2021 and 2022 with the ramp-up of Saskatchewan
              thermal heavy oil projects. Heavy oil production then drops down
              to 56% by 2040 as production from those projects levels off and
              growth in light oil outpaces growth in heavy oil. Both total heavy
              and total light oil production grow over the projection period
              after 2020, as well as conventional, tight, and shale production

            <li>
              Northeastern B.C. production is all light oil, with conventional
              oil making up the majority. While B.C. has substantial shares of
              Canadian natural gas production and resources (see
              <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2017ntrlgs/index-eng.html"
                >Energy Futures 2017 – Natural Gas Production Supplemental
                Report</a
              >), it does not have a significant amount of oil production.
            </li>
            <li>
              The majority of non-oil sands production in Alberta has and will
              continue to be light oil; most of the production growth over the
              projection period is from west-central parts of the province. As
              horizontal drilling and
              <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#multistagehydraulicfracturing"
                >multi-stage hydraulic fracturing</a
              >
              advanced over the last decade, tight oil production increased and
              will continue to make up a larger share. In 2016, conventional oil
              made up 67% of non-oil sands production in Alberta, by 2040 that
              share drops to 47%, tight oil&rsquo;s share increases to 51% and
              shale oil is the remainder.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heavy conventional oil makes up the majority of Saskatchewan
              production and grows substantially over the projection period
              given projected thermal heavy oil growth (see section 2.3). Tight
              oil production will also continue in Saskatchewan because of tight
              oil development in the southwest and southeast parts of the
              province.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manitoba production is entirely light oil. Manitoba light, tight
              oil production peaked in 2012 and 2013, and has since declined.
              However it will increase slightly later in the projection period
              as prices rise and stay high enough for new production to outpace
              production declines from existing wells. Conventional oil
              production will decline over the projection period.

              Growth in Saskatchewan conventional heavy oil production is from
              advancements in employing
              <a href="/nrg/tl/glssr-eng.html#steamassistedgravitydrainage"
                >steam assisted gravity drainage recovery</a
              >
              (SAGD) to heavy oil fields. There are currently 15 thermal heavy
              oil projects operating in Saskatchewan, a nearly threefold
              increase from 2012. Similar to the oil sands, production from
              these thermal projects does not exhibit the steep decline rates
              typical of traditional heavy oil wells. This generates revenues
              that enable ongoing capital expenditures and continued production
              growth over the projection period. Changes in market conditions,
              technology, or other factors could lead to production varying from
              this projection, especially for the later years.

            <li>
              Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods have long been used in
              Saskatchewan for secondary extraction. Production from existing
              projects, such as the CO<sub>2</sub> EOR projects currently
              operating in Weyburn and Midale, is starting to slowly taper off,
              and this trend is expected to continue over the projection period.

              This graph shows the Reference Case production projection for
              Thermal and EOR in Saskatchewan and the Zama region of Alberta.
              Growth from this sector is largely due to increases in thermal oil
              production due to the application of SAGD technologies to
              conventional heavy oil reservoirs in the Lloydminster area of
              Saskatchewan. Thermal Saskatchewan production increases from
              33.33&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016 to 106.3&nbsp;Mb/d in 2025 and stays level
              afterwards. Midale production decreases from 4.4&nbsp;Mb/d in 2016
              to 2.6&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Weyburn production decreases from 23.2
              thousands bbl/d in 2016 to 11.5&nbsp;Mb/d in 2040. Zama, in

              in western Canada has, for the most part, increased until
              recently. In 2006 it took an average of 8.0 days to drill and
              complete a well, and in 2015 it reached 10.3 days. By 2016 the
              average returned to 8.0 drill days per well due to the focus on
              thermal heavy oil projects in Saskatchewan which typically take
              only a few days to drill, continued drilling efficiency gains, and
              lower prices causing reduced drilling activity for tight oil and
              other oil wells. The projected days per well stays fairly level
              over the projection period, with the effects of more thermal heavy
              oil development in Saskatchewan balanced out by more conventional
              and tight drilling as the oil price rises

              Greater focus on developing tight oil has also increased the
              average initial production (IP) rate of wells in western Canada.
              The average IP was the lowest in 2006 at 41&nbsp;b/d as many
              shallow, vertical wells were being drilled, which generally
              produce less than deeper wells. The average IP for all wells
              drilled in western Canada increased to 87&nbsp;b/d by 2015. The
              average IP in 2016 was 69&nbsp;b/d and stays level until 2025.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Production varies between the cases, especially for the High and
              Low Price cases. All cases have the same trend of focusing on
              tight oil resources and thermal heavy oil projects in
              Saskatchewan.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              In all cases except for the Low Price Case and Higher Carbon Price
              + Technology Case, declining production eventually bottoms out
              before increasing towards the end of the projection period.
              Production in the Low Price Case declines over the entire
              projection while production in the Higher Carbon Price +
              Technology Case only increases over the next decade as the
              production from thermal projects in Saskatchewan grows. In these
              two declining cases, oil prices are not high enough to enable
              sufficient capital expenditures to drill the new wells required to
              outpace production declines from older wells, and total production
              declines. In the Low Price Case, production drops to 53
              10&sup3;m&sup3;/d (0.3&nbsp;MMb/d) in 2040 – a quarter of the
              amount in the Reference Case. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Production in the High Price Case reaches 402 10&sup3;m&sup3;/d
              (2.5&nbsp;MMb/d) in 2040, twice as much as the Reference Case.
              This is largely from a compounding effect over the duration of the
              projection, where higher prices generate more revenue to enable
              more drilling and more production
              <sup id="fn11-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"

              >. Projected production from thermal projects in Saskatchewan is
              also higher than in the Reference Case.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the two higher carbon price cases, higher carbon costs and
              lower crude oil prices result in conventional production growing
              slower than in the Reference Case. Production in the Reference +
              Technology Case is lower than in the Reference Case because lower
              oil prices and technology improvements were only applied to oil
              sands with no changes to conventional, tight, and shale oil
              technology between the two cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the High Price Case increased investment leads to new East
              Coast offshore discoveries, the first of which occurs in 2024,
              three years earlier than in the Reference Case. Two additional
              discoveries occur in 2027 and 2030; total production from all
              offshore facilities peaks at 61.4 m&sup3;/d (386&nbsp;Mb/d) in
              2025. In the Low Price Case production peaks at 49.1 m&sup3;/d
              (309&nbsp;Mb/d) in 2023 with no new offshore discoveries due to
              persistent low prices.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Oil prices are a key driver of future oil production and a key
              uncertainty to the projections in EF2017. Crude oil prices could
              be higher or lower depending on demand trends, technological
              developments, geopolitical events, and the pace at which nations
              enact policies to reduce GHG emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              This analysis assumes that over the long term, all energy
              production will find markets and infrastructure will be built as
              needed. However, projects to increase oil transportation capacity
              in North America have proven controversial. Sufficiency of
              pipeline infrastructure, or oil movements by rail will impact
              pricing of Canadian crude oil and the economics of production.
            </li>
            <li>
              The higher carbon price cases assume that global crude oil prices
              are lower than the Reference Case. This is uncertain and depends
              on coordinated global climate action, the responsiveness of oil
              demand to higher carbon costs, and the availability of
              alternatives to existing technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oil production depends on price, but also on recovery technology
              and drilling efficiency and costs. Should technology or costs
              advance differently than assumed, capital expenditures and well
              production projections would be different than modelled here.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thermal recovery of Saskatchewan&rsquo;s heavy oil resources is a
              recent trend and future production growth is uncertain. Other
              technologies may also be adopted.

          <h2 id="smmr">Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Energy has and always will be extremely important to Canadians. With
            our northern climate, huge land mass and vast natural resources, we
            use energy to heat our homes, provide transport, develop our
            resources and produce goods and services. Energy is essential to our
            comfort and our economic prosperity.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, there is growing awareness of the consequences of
            energy use to our physical environment, the air quality in our
            cities, our health and the potential impact on the climate of our
            planet. Finding ways to produce and use energy that minimize the
            impacts on our environment is one of the key challenges Canadians
            face in the 21st century.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report, <em>Canada's Energy Future</em>, allows the National
            Energy Board (NEB or Board) to communicate with Canadians about
            energy issues. Providing this information is part of the NEB's
            overall goal that Canadians benefit from efficient energy
            infrastructure and markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Canada's Energy Future</em> highlights the issues Canadians face
            with respect to energy, as well as brings to light future
            implications for Canadian energy producers and consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the report focuses on trends in energy supply and demand, it
            does not offer specific policy direction as to what programs or
            actions would be required to meet certain objectives. It is up to us
            as Canadians, the energy industry and policy-makers to determine the
            desired outcome and the tools required to get us there. It is our
            hope that this report will be a positive contribution to the growing
            discussion many Canadians are having about energy and our
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report examines different possible energy futures that may
            unfold for Canadians up to the year 2030. This includes a baseline
            projection, called the Reference Case, which is the Board's view of
            the most likely outcome up to the year 2015. Three different
            scenarios, each with its own internally consistent set of
            assumptions, such as economic growth, action on environmental issues
            and energy prices, are then used to examine Canada's energy future
            to 2030:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Continuing Trends Scenario: </strong>Trends that are
              apparent at the beginning of the outlook period are maintained
              throughout the entire forecast and extend the Reference Case over
              the long-term.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Triple E Scenario: </strong>A balancing of economic,
              environmental and energy objectives means this scenario has
              well-functioning energy markets, cooperative international
              agreements and the most rigorous energy demand management policies
              of the three scenarios.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fortified Islands Scenario: </strong>Security concerns
              dominate this scenario with geopolitical unrest, a lack of
              international cooperation and trust, and protectionist government
              policies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The main findings of this report are as follows:</p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Energy demand in Canada will continue to grow for the next
              30&nbsp;years.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Energy demand will remain primarily a function of population and
              economic growth. With these two factors on the rise, energy demand
              is growing (Figure ES.1). The way Canadians use energy will
              change, but slowly. This is because our office buildings, homes
              and vehicles are not replaced or upgraded on a regular basis to
              take advantage of the latest energy efficient technologies. Over
              the long-term, there will be opportunities for Canadians to reduce
              their energy demand as improvements in energy efficiency and
              technology take effect.

              Canadians will continue to use automobiles for personal
              transportation. Although these vehicles are becoming more energy
              efficient, they will still rely primarily on fossil fuels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Energy efficiency across the economy will continue to improve. The
              rate of improvement will depend on government policies and
              Canadians' commitment to managing the growth in energy demand.
            </li>
            <li>
              There will be a continued demand for natural gas including the
              need for gas in oil sands processing and electricity generation.
              However, there is also a move toward gas alternatives including
              substitution to other forms of energy and improved efficiency.
              This is especially true in the Triple E Scenario.

              Fossil fuels will continue to be the dominant source of energy
              supply for Canadians through to 2030. New emerging technologies
              and renewable energy resources, such as wind power and small hydro
              power projects, will be increasingly used.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oil sands production will grow in all three scenarios and the
              production will contribute to increased exports and Canadian
              economic growth. Large volumes of crude coming from the oil sands
              will be moved to market and will require appropriate
              infrastructure to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural gas production from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin
              (WCSB) will decline. In fact, in two of the three scenarios, total
              natural gas production declines. However, there are opportunities
              for development of gas reserves in northern and offshore regions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) will increase in both the
              Continuing Trends and Triple E Scenarios. In the Triple E
              Scenario, LNG imports will account for half of Canada's gas needs
              by&nbsp;2030.

            <li>
              In the three scenarios studied, GHG emissions increase or decline
              slightly. In the Continuing Trends and Fortified Islands
              Scenarios, GHG emissions increase as a result of continued
              economic and energy demand growth. Under the Triple E Scenario,
              GHG emissions decline modestly as a result of energy demand
              management programs. Further changes by Canadians in lifestyle
              choices and more ambitious energy reduction programs, will be
              required to achieve additional reductions in GHG emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to achieve the Canadian government's target of a
              20&nbsp;percent reduction in GHG emissions by&nbsp;2020, the full
              spectrum of GHG reduction strategies will need to be considered.
              Elements of solution, amongst others, will be found in agriculture
              and forestry carbon sinks and international emissions trading.
              This report, being focused on energy in Canada, did not seek to
              analyze these broader strategies.

          <p><strong>GHG emission intensity is declining.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Overall GHG emission intensity in Canada is declining. This means
              fewer GHG emissions to produce the same amount of goods and
              services (Figure&nbsp;ES.2). The future rate of decline differs
              depending on the policies and programs that are adopted.

              Technology can offer solutions to many challenges that we face
              today. The type of technology choice will depend on the scenario
              that will unfold in the future. Seizing technology opportunities
              requires a combination of market mechanisms and incentives.

            <li>
              The markets will continue to work well, balancing energy demand
              and supply. However, a 'smart' policy is needed to help optimize
              the multiple objectives of economic growth, environmental
              sustainability, and responsible development of the energy sector.
              A proactive approach will be important due to the wide regional
              differences with respect to energy and emissions, evolving energy
              supply systems, and a changing global environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Major investments are needed in the near future to develop new
              sources of energy and meet the growth in energy demand as well as
              replace the ageing infrastructure. With our abundant supply of
              energy, including northern and offshore resources and wind power,
              infrastructure is needed to bring it to market. There will also be
              a need for increased infrastructure between provinces for
              electricity generation. The infrastructure investments will
              require public engagement, buy-in and acceptance for these
              initiatives.

              Appropriate and adequate analysis of energy issues will continue

          <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
          <p>
            The debate in Canada over the future of Canada's energy resources
            and our environment is growing. As Canadians plan for the future,
            they will face many decisions about what kind of a lifestyle they
            want to live and how that lifestyle reflects the broader issues
            impacting Canada's economy and environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A long-term energy vision and strategy for Canada is needed to
            balance multiple objectives. This plan must be well integrated at
            the regional level, consider environmental issues and economic
            growth, and be developed with input from Canadians. Only then will
            we be able to overcome the challenges ahead and take advantage of
            the opportunities available.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB plans to contribute to this debate by continuing to pursue
            our vision of being an active, effective and knowledgeable partner
            engaging Canadians in the discussion of Canada's energy future.

            This section provides an overview of the quantitative results
            contained within the report. A more detailed exploration of these
            results is discussed in subsequent chapters. As well, detailed
            provincial data tables can be found in the appendices.

          <p>
            Energy issues have an important influence on the lives of Canadians
            and have become more important in recent years. Rapidly increasing
            energy prices have given rise to concerns about whether or not
            energy supply will remain available in sufficient quantities and at
            reasonable prices. These energy security concerns are underpinned by
            international geopolitical tensions and conflicts, the apparent
            peaking of conventional resources in some parts of the world, and a
            rapid increase in global energy demand due to the pace of growth in
            developing countries. Furthermore, as evidence of the environmental
            impacts of energy production and use mount, Canadians are also
            paying greater attention to the sustainability of the energy system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to these issues, the National Energy Board (NEB or the
            Board) has developed the latest in its series of long-term energy
            demand and supply outlooks. <em>Canada's Energy Future</em> depicts
            the analytical results of four different energy demand and supply
            cases representing the period 2005 to 2030. The report presents
            possible energy futures only and does not predict outcomes of
            regulatory decisions by the Board. The Board presents these cases to
            enable Canadians to discuss Canada's energy future.

            >
            The Reference Case is the NEB's view of the most likely development
            of energy demand and supply over the immediate decade, assuming
            current energy market trends, the macroeconomic outlook, assumed
            energy prices and the existing suite of government programs. Overall
            energy production, consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
            continue to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Long-Term Scenarios (2005-2030)</em></strong>
          </p>

            <strong
              ><em
                >The other three cases are alternative long-term scenarios,
                which endeavour to capture a broader range of energy system
                outcomes.</em
              ></strong
            >
            The analysis for these three cases covers the period from 2005 to
            2030. Long lead times for project development and stock turnover
            imply that for differences in outcomes to occur by 2030, key
            decisions need to be taken early. Therefore, the scenario analysis
            begins in 2005 and overlaps the Reference Case period. The three
            scenarios are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><em
                  >Continuing Trends, which is characterized by the maintenance
                  of significant trends apparent at the beginning of the outlook
                  period through the forecast period.</em
                ></strong
              >
              This scenario is one of little change. In Continuing Trends,
              Canada experiences the most rapid economic growth and moderate oil
              and gas prices. As a result, energy demand, energy production and
              GHG emissions growth continue to be high.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><em
                  >Triple&nbsp;E is characterized by well-functioning global
                  energy markets, cooperative international agreements and
                  effective environmental policies.</em
                ></strong
              >
              The scenario seeks a balance of economic, environmental, and
              energy (Triple E) objectives. This scenario is the mid-case for
              Canadian economic growth, has the lowest oil and gas commodity
              prices, and includes numerous energy demand management programs
              and policies. Consequently, energy demand growth flattens. This is
              the lowest energy production scenario and GHG emissions decline.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                ><em
                  >Fortified Islands is the scenario wherein national energy
                  security concerns are emphasized.</em
                ></strong
              >
              Geopolitical unrest, a lack of international cooperation and
              trust, and protectionist government policies characterize this
              scenario. Fortified Islands reflects the lowest Canadian economic
              growth and the highest oil and gas prices. This combination of
              factors ensures that this scenario has lower energy demand growth
              and lower GHG emissions growth than the Continuing Trends
              Scenario. It also results in the strongest domestic oil and gas
              production scenario.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of the scenarios provides value by exploring a plausible
            future. It is unlikely that any one of these scenarios would come
            true in its entirety. Canadians will probably see a future that
            contains elements of all the different scenarios.

            Macroeconomic variables including economic growth, gross output, and
            personal disposable income are used to develop the supply and demand
            outlooks. The structure of the Canadian economy (i.e.,&nbsp;goods
            production versus service sector) and the regional distribution of
            gross domestic product (GDP) will influence demand trends.

            This outcome is driven by demographic factors, such as an ageing
            population and lower birth rates. This results in slower average
            economic growth projections over all three scenarios than has been
            experienced in the recent past. Labour force growth varies between
            0.6 percent and 1.1&nbsp;percent over the Reference Case and
            scenarios (Figure AO.1). Altering levels of immigration across
            scenarios provide variations in the demography, but does not reverse
            overall trends. Productivity assumptions range between 1.2 percent
            and 1.6 percent. Productivity growth in the scenarios matches, or is
            modestly close to, growth in the recent past.
          </p>
          <p>
            All factors considered, the Reference Case projects continued strong
            economic growth. This is maintained into Continuing Trends which
            reflects the highest economic growth of the three scenarios.
            Fortified Islands is the low economic growth scenario and Triple E
            falls in the middle. In 2030, the Triple E economy is 7 percent
            smaller and Fortified Islands is 10 percent smaller than the
            Continuing Trends economy.

            maintains its current share of GDP. Slower export demand for
            manufactured goods and marginally higher exchange rates in Fortified
            Islands lowers the goods producing share while the service sector
            share grows slightly.

            (Figure&nbsp;AO.3). In Continuing Trends, the share of regional GDP
            changes little from current shares. In Triple E, the shift in
            economic growth favouring central Canada is a result of relatively
            strong growth of manufacturing stemming from strong export demand.
            The opposite effect occurs in Fortified Islands where slow
            manufacturing export demand and high oil and gas prices hinder the
            manufacturing regions, but produce a boom in the oil and gas
            producing regions.

            As Continuing Trends extends the Reference Case out to 2030, the
            same assumptions apply, continuing the trends of the recent history
            into the future. As the forecast progresses to 2030, however, there
            is a slight slowdown in Canadian economic growth, personal
            disposable income and population, as described in the previous
            section. As a result, the energy demand growth rate for the
            Continuing Trends Scenario slows to 1.4&nbsp;percent per year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Economic growth and personal disposable income growth in Triple E is
            moderate. While commodity prices are lowest in this case, the
            assumed carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) price drives up delivered
            fuel prices comparable to Continuing Trends. Thus, 'dual' pricing
            exists in this scenario, with producers facing the lower commodity
            price (Figure&nbsp;AO.4 and&nbsp;AO.5) and consumers seeing the
            higher delivered price<sup>[3]</sup>. Energy efficiency and
            environment influences are strongest in this case, with numerous
            government policies and programs assumed. This results in the
            slowest growth in Triple E, with an average annual growth rate of
            0.3&nbsp;percent per year from&nbsp;2004 to&nbsp;2030.

            In Fortified Islands, total energy demand grows at 0.7 percent per
            year. This scenario is characterized by slower economic growth and
            higher commodity prices. This supports a deceleration in total
            energy demand compared to Continuing Trends and to historical rates
            due to the dampening income and price effect.

            This decline is somewhat softened by the influence of higher oil
            prices in the Fortified Islands Scenario and by government support
            for CO<sub>2</sub>-based improved oil recovery (IOR)<sup>[4]</sup>
            in the Triple E Scenario. The lower price in Triple E discourages
            development on marginal plays. Noticeable areas of impact include
            east coast offshore and oil sands. As a result, output declines in
            the latter half of the analysis timeframe. Conversely, high oil
            prices in Fortified Islands encourage development resulting in
            significant additional production.

            well as the sourcing of adequate supplies of condensate or other
            diluent for use as a blending agent for heavy oil. It is also
            assumed that industry can economically adopt future environmental

            (Figure AO.8 and AO.9). Continuing Trends shows minor increases in
            domestic demand for light crude oil and some displacement of
            conventional light crude oil in the feedstock slate to synthetic
            crude oil. The Triple E Scenario shows a marginal decline in exports
            in the latter portion of the outlook period compared to the
            beginning of the outlook as a result of a slowing supply forecast.
            In Fortified Islands, the highest volume of exports is forecast with
            the possibility of Quebec refineries obtaining access to western
            Canadian crude oil. Overall, both light and heavy crude oil exports
            decline in the Triple E Scenario. In Fortified Islands, there is the
            highest growth in the three scenarios for both light and heavy crude
            oil exports. In the Continuing Trends Scenario, there is little
            change in the light crude oil exports over the forecast period and
            moderate growth in heavy oil exports. Overall, light crude oil
            exports exceed heavy oil exports in all scenarios.

            2028, as more LNG enters Canada than conventional natural gas
            exported. In the later years of the outlook, Canada becomes a net

            Total Canadian gas demand growth is lower in Triple&nbsp;E and
            Fortified Islands. In Triple E this is due to increased efficiency
            and lower demand for gas from oil sands projects; in Fortified
            Islands it is a result of higher energy prices and slower economic
            growth. In the Fortified Islands Scenario, the amount of potential
            net exports erodes slightly until&nbsp;2015. At this point, frontier
            gas production comes on-stream and enables new records to be
            established for net annual natural gas exports.

            may potentially be extracted within Canada to supplement domestic
            supplies. An alternative concept might see Alaskan gas shipped as

            Long-term ethane supply becomes less reliable in the forecast. By
            the end of the outlook period in both the Continuing Trends and
            Triple E Scenarios, ethane demand exceeds supply. This is a direct
            result of gas production decreases due to lower prices and continued
            growth in demand from the Alberta petrochemical sector. In Fortified
            Islands, ethane supply exceeds demand in the longer term owing to
            significant increments of supply from oil sands off-gas, straddle
            plant expansions and Mackenzie Delta gas.

            In Ontario, existing coal plants are retired by 2015, replaced by a
            mixture of gas, nuclear, wind and other emerging technologies.
            Nuclear generation sees a renaissance in all three scenarios, as
            five new nuclear plants are constructed to replace retiring coal
            units and older nuclear plants. Emerging technologies are also used
            for coal-fired generation, with Integrated Gasification Combined
            Cycle (IGCC) becoming available after 2015. All scenarios assume an
            expanded use of bitumen for cogeneration in the Alberta oil sands.
            Since the amount of cogeneration is linked to oil sands production,
            cogeneration is highest in the Fortified Islands Scenario and lowest
            in Triple&nbsp;E.

            High natural gas prices and concerns about security of supply
            favours coal-fired generation in the Fortified Islands Scenario,
            while lower natural gas prices and concern about emissions favour
            natural gas generation in the Triple&nbsp;E Scenario. The Triple E
            Scenario also favours the development of alternative sources of
            energy, with more wind and biomass than the other scenarios as well
            as pilot projects for wave and tidal power. This scenario also
            includes IGCC power plants with CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage
            (CCS) technology in Alberta and Saskatchewan after 2019.

            With demand peaking and then beginning to decline, exports and
            interprovincial trade increases dramatically in the Fortified
            Islands and Triple E Scenarios, although the drivers are dissimilar.
            In Fortified Islands, wind and hydro power are seen as safe and
            secure from high fossil fuel prices. In Triple&nbsp;E, the advantage
            of wind and hydro power stems from their being a GHG-neutral form of
            generation. Higher demand in Continuing Trends is met primarily with
            increased hydro generation. A&nbsp;general tightening in domestic
            supply reduces opportunities for export in this scenario.

            Both total production and demand is highest in the Continuing Trends
            Scenario. In Triple E, thermal demand is lower and utilizes IGCC and
            CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage. Low economic growth and high
            prices lead to lower thermal demand in Fortified Islands. The
            closure of Ontario's coal-fired plants is a key influence on the
            short- and long-term imports of thermal coal, while exports of
            metallurgical coal are expected to grow with the expansion in the
            international iron and steel industry. The potential for IGCC and
            CCS, and the success of other new coal technologies to address
            environmental concerns, depends on cost and acceptability relative
            to generation alternatives. Net exports remain positive and increase
            in all scenarios.

            expected to grow at 0.6 percent per year. The slower growth in this
            scenario, compared to history, is a direct result of higher energy
            prices and slower income and economic growth in the Canadian
            economy, excluding the oil and gas producing sector. In the Triple E
            Scenario, GHG emissions are expected to decrease by 0.1&nbsp;percent

            Recent federal government announcements have targeted a reduction in
            Canadian GHG emissions by 20 percent below 2006 levels by the
            year&nbsp;2020. There are considerable uncertainties surrounding the
            means to achieve this reduction. In all scenarios examined, Canada
            partially achieves the '20 percent by&nbsp;2020' goal set by the
            Government. There are numerous paths to GHG emission reductions.
            These paths will have potentially major impacts on technological
            choices, configuration of our cities and energy systems, as well as
            consumer behaviour. Identification of the specific mechanisms that
            will allow us to achieve this target has proven to be unattainable

            This report is an analysis of Canada's possible energy futures. As
            such, the report focuses strictly on GHG emission reductions from
            energy-related activities in Canada (e.g., energy efficiency
            measures, improved energy management systems or investment in CO<sub
              >2</sub
            >
            capture and storage). The analysis does not directly focus on GHG
            emission reduction strategies. For example, the analysis does not
            incorporate two potential sources of GHG emissions reductions: (a)
            non-energy-related emission reductions such as carbon sequestration
            in agriculture and forestry; and (b) GHG emission reductions from
            international mechanisms such as access to Kyoto's Clean Development
            Mechanism, or international CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trading
            regimes. Consideration of these and others as part of a full
            spectrum of GHG reduction strategies could go a long way in
            contributing to Canada meeting its target of 20 percent by 2020.

            Prices in the long-term are expected to be higher than those

            The type and mix of energy resources will be determined by the level
            of energy prices. Overall, Canadian energy supply and the fuel mix
            is quite price-responsive, creating a broad range of outcomes in
            response to alternative price trajectories and the socioeconomic
            environment modeled in the three scenarios.

            conventional at the base, but varies in terms of additions from
            emerging and alternative technologies and fuels.

            Demand continues to be inelastic in the short term due to the long
            life of the existing stock of buildings, vehicles and urban design
            of Canadian cities. However, in the long-term, there is opportunity
            for demand reductions in response to targeted policies and programs,
            including improvements in energy efficiency.

            Oil and electricity exports increase in all scenarios, while natural
            gas net exports increase only in Fortified Islands. The increase in
            oil exports is a direct result of growing oil sands production in

            immigration.

            The GHG emissions per unit of energy used declines in all scenarios,
            but the rate of decline varies based on policies and programs
            considered.

            and local interests in order to improve the predictability of
            project completion. In some cases, this may include improving
            clarity in the regulatory and public engagement processes, while in
            other cases it may require more use of 'single window' approaches
            when several jurisdictions are involved.

            The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is an independent
            federal agency that regulates several aspects of Canada's energy
            industry. Its purpose is to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and efficient energy infrastructure and
            markets in the Canadian public interest<sup>[*]</sup> within the
            mandate set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
            development and trade. The main functions of the NEB include
            regulating the construction and operation of pipelines that cross
            international or provincial borders, as well as tolls and tariffs.
            Another key role is to regulate international power lines and
            designated interprovincial power lines. The NEB also regulates
            natural gas imports and exports, oil, natural gas liquids, and
            electricity exports, and some oil and gas exploration on frontier
            lands, particularly in Canada's North and certain offshore areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB collects and analyzes information about Canadian energy
            markets through regulatory processes and market monitoring. From
            these efforts, the Board produces publications, statistical reports
            and speeches that address various market aspects of Canada's energy
            commodities. The Energy Market Assessment (EMA) reports published by
            the Board provide analyses of the major energy commodities. Through
            these EMAs, Canadians are informed about the outlook for energy
            supplies and demand in order to develop an understanding of the
            issues underlying energy-related decisions.

            This EMA report, titled <em>Canada's Energy Future</em>, examines
            the long-term energy demand and supply possibilities within Canada.
            The main objectives of this report are to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              provide unbiased, relevant, comprehensive, expert analysis on
              energy supply, demand and its economic and environmental
              implications to serve as a standard of reference for parties
              interested in Canadian energy issues and trends;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide stimulus for discussion with and amongst stakeholders,
              both during and after the completion of the report on emerging
              energy issues of national importance; and,
            </li>
            <li>
              inform decision makers of key risks and uncertainties facing the
              energy future and advise them of regulatory and other issues that
              need to be addressed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While preparing this report, the NEB conducted a series of formal
            and informal meetings with energy market experts and other
            interested parties. The NEB appreciates the information and comments
            provided and would like to thank all participants for their time and
            expertise. The NEB would also like to thank the numerous dedicated

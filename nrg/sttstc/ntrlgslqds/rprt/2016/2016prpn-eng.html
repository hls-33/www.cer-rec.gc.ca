          <h2 id="s1">1. Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The propane market underwent significant changes after
            winter&nbsp;2013/14 – best known for the “polar vortex” that
            dramatically dropped temperatures across much of eastern Canada and
            the United States (U.S.). Heating fuel prices spiked; in the case of
            propane, reports of supply shortages in Ontario, Quebec, and the
            U.S. Midwest attracted significant media and political attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the two&nbsp;years since the polar vortex, prices at major
            propane hubs have declined to their lowest levels since 2002. Prices
            at the Edmonton hub fell 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent between February 2014
            and February 2015, from 217.9&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon to
            22.6&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon. Over the same time frame,
            prices at the Sarnia hub fell from 236.9&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per
            gallon to 71.9&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon, a
            70&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent decline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two extreme market events highlight the volatility of propane prices
            in the past two&nbsp;years:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              daily spot prices at the Conway hub in Kansas surged above
              400&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon at the peak of the polar
              vortex on January&nbsp;23 and&nbsp;24, 2014; and,
            </li>
            <li>
              prices in Edmonton traded below zero (that is, producers were
              paying others to take their propane away) by June 2015.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Strong growth in U.S. propane production, underpinned by
            liquids-rich shale gas development in the U.S. Northeast, and soft
            seasonal demand have been the driving forces behind low prices
            throughout the integrated Canada and U.S. propane market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Propane in underground storage in Canada and the U.S. reached record
            highs in 2014 and 2015. As of April 2016, U.S. inventories remained
            significantly above the five-year average, while Canadian
            inventories are now close to the five-year average.
          </p>
          <p>
            Western Canadian propane production from gas plants fell slightly in
            2015 to 167.8&nbsp;thousand barrels per day (Mb/d). Exports of
            propane from Canada were up 24&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2015, as new
            rail loading facilities in Alberta helped replace lost export
            capacity following reversal of the Cochin Pipeline in 2014. Most of
            these exports have been to the U.S.
          </p>
          <p>
            U.S. propane exports continue growing as new Gulf Coast export
            capacity has been constructed to help ship propane from the
            well-supplied Canada and U.S. market. With exports averaging 615.5
            Mb/d in 2015, the U.S. now exports approximately
            50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of its propane production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The propane industry in Canada continues to evolve. This includes
            midstream developments, such as new rail loading capacity at the
            Edmonton/Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta hub. In Ontario, the largest
            residential propane consuming region in Canada, there have been new
            infrastructure investments in rail offloading terminals and
            expansions of above-ground storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, despite concerns during winter&nbsp;2013/14 that prices
            might remain high and supply low because of structural issues in the
            propane market, the events of the last two&nbsp;years indicate
            otherwise.

          <h2 id="s2">2. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In February 2014, the Ministers of Natural Resources and Industry
            <a
              href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media-room/news-release/2014/14980"
              rel="external"
              >requested</a
            >
            that the National Energy Board (NEB or Board) and the Competition
            Bureau (Bureau) work together to review rapid propane price
            increases and reports of supply shortages during
            winter&nbsp;2013/14.
          </p>

              ></a
            >
            (Final Report) was released in April 2014 and had the following
            conclusions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A colder-than-normal winter across the eastern parts of Canada and
              the U.S. resulted in greater demand for propane to meet home or
              space heating requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              An exceptionally large and wet corn harvest in the U.S. Midwest
              resulted in higher-than-normal demand for propane (which is used
              for crop-drying, particularly corn) prior to the heating season.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supply chain congestion and disruptions due to weather and
              maintenance resulted in less propane being available for delivery
              and distribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              U.S. propane exports had been growing rapidly and this reallocated
              propane that might have otherwise been available for Canadian and
              U.S. markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              There was no inherent supply-demand imbalance in the propane
              industry that would create ongoing supply shocks, but propane
              demand and prices were found to be volatile and unforeseen events
              would likely cause volatility again.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For the Final Report, the Bureau assessed the structure of the
            propane market in Canada and performed an independent examination of
            anti-competitive behaviour in the propane market during
            winter&nbsp;2013/14. The Bureau did not find sufficient evidence to
            conclude that anti-competitive activities exacerbated the impact of
            the price spike on consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Final Report, the NEB has continued to monitor markets for
            propane and other natural gas liquids (NGLs). The NEB has also
            informed Canadians about energy market developments through
            publications such as weekly Market Snapshots. Propane-related
            Snapshots were released in November 2014 (<a

            The illustration below (<a href="#f2_1">Figure&nbsp;2.1</a>), taken
            from the Final Report, shows the structure of the Canadian propane
            industry. The industry is divided into three segments: upstream,
            midstream and downstream, and their respective roles within the

                This diagram illustrates the propane industry supply chain.
                Propane is produced from natural gas and as a by-product of oil
                refining. Propane from natural gas wells is extracted as a
                stream of natural gas liquids, which are transported by pipeline
                to a field gas plant or straddle plant, and then transported by
                a natural gas liquids pipeline to a fractionator. Once propane
                has been separated from other natural gas liquids by the
                fractionator, it is transported by a propane pipeline or rail
                line to either an underground storage cavern in Canada, or to
                the U.S. for export. Propane from oil wells is based on
                unrefined oil transported by oil pipelines and rail to a
                refinery, where the propane is separated from other petroleum
                products. Once it has been separated, propane is either used for
                that refinery’s own use, or is transported by pipeline or rail
                line to underground storage caverns in Canada. Propane can also
                be imported from the U.S. via propane pipelines and rail for
                storage in underground caverns. Storage caverns in Canada have
                capacities ranging from 25&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;barrels to
                4&nbsp;million&nbsp;barrels. Propane is extracted from storage
                caverns via propane terminals, and then shipped by truck or rail
                to propane retailers. Propane transport trucks have a capacity
                of 240 to 390&nbsp;barrels, and propane rail cars have a
                capacity of approximately 750&nbsp;barrels. Propane retailers
                then store the propane in tanks with a capacity of 125 to
                1&nbsp;250&nbsp;barrels per retailer, and use bobtails and tank
                wagons, which have a capacity of between 95 to 200&nbsp;barrels,
                to deliver propane to end customers. Activities involving
                extraction and processing of propane are typically referred to
                as “upstream” activities, whereas storage and transportation are
                considered “midstream”, and end delivery is “downstream”.

          <h2 id="s3">3. Canadian Propane Production</h2>

          <p>
            The vast majority of Canadian propane is produced by gas plants in
            western Canada.<sup id="fn2-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>2</a
              ></sup
            >
            Western Canadian gas plant production of propane has been trending
            upwards since 2010, primarily due to growing development of the
            liquids-rich Montney formation of northeast British Columbia (B.C.)
            and the Alberta Deep Basin. In 2014, western Canadian gas plant
            production of propane reached a 10-year high, averaging 173.9 Mb/d,

                Canadian propane production from natural gas processing plants
                between 2000 and 2014. Western Canadian natural gas production
                has generally declined between 2001 and 2012, from
                16.8&nbsp;billion&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;feet per day in 2001 to

                western Canadian gas production had rebounded to
                14.7&nbsp;billion&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;feet per day. Western Canadian
                propane production from gas processing plants has generally

                This graph illustrates the annual volumes of propane exported
                from Canada in thousand barrels per day between 2003 and 2015.
                Generally speaking, exports decreased from 2003 to 2010, and
                then rebounded from 2011 to 2015. The graph also shows the mode

                role of pipelines in exporting propane has been gradually
                declining, while the role of rail has been increasing. In 2015,
                total propane exports were 112.5&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;barrels per

            The U.S. destinations for Canadian propane exports changed slightly
            in 2015, particularly with respect to exports to the West Coast
            (PADD&nbsp;V). From 2009 to 2014, roughly 14&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of
            Canadian propane exports were delivered to PADD&nbsp;V. By the
            second half of 2015, the percentage of propane exports to
            PADD&nbsp;V had more than doubled to 29&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. The
            addition of propane export capabilities at the Petrogas facility in
            Ferndale, Washington is likely the reason for this leap in Canadian
            propane exports to PADD&nbsp;V. Petrogas is exporting approximately
            35 Mb/d of propane and butanes. Currently, all propane exported from
            Canada to the U.S. by Petrogas is under short-term order.

                This graph illustrates monthly U.S. propane production from gas
                plants and refineries from January 2010 to January 2016. U.S.
                propane production has grown from an average
                867&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;barrels per day in 2010 to an average
                1.4&nbsp;million&nbsp;barrels per day in 2015.

          <p>
            The slowdown in U.S. propane production growth can be attributed to
            low NGL prices as well as a slowdown in natural gas production
            growth. U.S. dry gas production grew 5.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2015
            versus 6.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2014. Preliminary indicators
            suggest that U.S. natural gas production may be flattening or even
            declining in response to low natural gas prices.

            Propane is also being exported from the U.S. West Coast. The
            Petrogas export facility in Ferndale, Washington started exporting
            propane to Asian markets following the completion of an expansion in
            April 2015. Previously, the Petrogas facility had exported only
            butanes.

            Asia has been a significant market for U.S. propane exports,

            The Asian market now accounts for roughly a third of U.S. propane
            exports. U.S. propane deliveries to other markets such as Europe,
            South America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America, have only
            grown slightly since 2014.

            Underground storage of propane in Canada and the U.S. remains high
            following winter&nbsp;2013/14 due to strong supply, weak demand, and
            a more cautious downstream propane industry. Canadian propane
            inventories remained high between August 2014 and August 2015,
            primarily due to reversal of the Cochin Pipeline, strong U.S.
            production growth that displaced demand for Canadian propane, and a
            less severe 2014/15 winter. (<a href="#f7_1">Figure&nbsp;7.1</a>)

                This graph illustrates monthly underground volumes of propane in
                storage in Canada in 2014, 2015, and 2016. These storage volumes

            In Canada, propane inventories reached a record high of
            12.1&nbsp;MMb in December 2014. The bulk of this storage was in
            western Canada, where inventories stood at 6.8&nbsp;MMb –
            42&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent above the previous five-year average for
            December. By October 2015, the storage overhang had disappeared due
            to the addition of new rail loading capacity for propane in western
            Canada, and Canadian inventories returned to the five-year average
            (2009-2013). In April 2016, Canadian inventories were reported at
            3.3&nbsp;MMb, 32&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent above the five-year average
            (2009-2013), but well within the five-year range.

          <p>
            U.S. propane inventories rebounded strongly following substantial
            withdrawals made during winter&nbsp;2013/14, reaching levels far
            above the five-year average (2009-2013) for winter of 2014/15 (<a

            resumed rapid growth. By December 2015, U.S. inventories reached a
            record high of 107.1&nbsp;MMb. As of early April 2016, total U.S.
            inventories were at 64.9&nbsp;MMb – approximately

            The majority of U.S. underground storage capacity is in the Gulf
            Coast. This is also where the bulk of the current storage surplus
            resides. Since January 2015, Gulf Coast storage has averaged
            88&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent above the five-year average (2009-2013).
            However, that storage surplus has been shrinking quickly in 2016 as
            U.S. export growth has been drawing down propane inventories at a
            rapid pace.

          <p>
            Major North American pricing and storage hubs for propane include:
            Edmonton, Alberta; Sarnia, Ontario; Conway, Kansas; and Mont
            Belvieu, Texas (<a href="#f4_3">Figure&nbsp;4.3</a>). Prices at
            these hubs tend to move in tandem with each other, although regional
            differences do exist. For example, Edmonton generally trades at a
            discount to all the other hubs, reflecting ample supplies and high
            transportation costs to move propane out of the Edmonton/Fort
            Saskatchewan area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following winter&nbsp;2013/14, propane prices at all North American
            hubs have been on the decline (<a href="#f8_1">Figure&nbsp;8.1</a>).
            In Edmonton, after prices reached highs of
            217.9&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon in February 2014, prices
            declined to 22.6&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon in February 2015 –
            a 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent decline. Similarly in Sarnia, prices
            declined from 236.9&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon in February 2014
            to 71.9&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon in February 2015 – a
            70&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent decline. By February 2016, prices declined
            further to average 10.9&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon and
            60.3&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;cents per gallon respectively, at Edmonton and

            From January 2015 to July 2015, underground propane inventories in
            western Canada were at a record high due to the winter&nbsp;2014/15
            storage hangover. The resulting storage surplus in Edmonton (and
            elsewhere in North America) combined with tight takeaway capacity
            led to Edmonton prices going negative in June 2015 (that is,
            producers paying others to take their propane away).
          </p>
          <p>
            Inventories in western Canada fell more in-line with the five-year
            average (2009-2013) by November 2015, following a summer of high
            exports. However, Edmonton prices remain the lowest in North America
            heading into 2016. Sellers of propane in Edmonton had to offer
            substantial discounts in order to remain competitive in the
            well-supplied U.S. market.

                This graph illustrates monthly Canadian average automotive
                propane prices and their relationship with Canadian wholesale
                propane prices in Edmonton and Sarnia. Wholesale and retail
                prices track closely, and following the price spike in January
                and February 2014, both wholesale and retail prices have
                generally declined. Also, Edmonton prices have detached from
                Sarnia prices since mid-2014 and fell to record lows in 2015.

          <h2 id="s9">9. Seasonal Market Drivers</h2>
          <p>
            Seasonal factors can have significant effects on propane markets,
            particularly when those effects fall outside the range of “normal”
            or expected outcomes. Just as extreme cold conditions and high
            agricultural demand can cause heating fuel prices to spike, as they
            did in winter&nbsp;2013/14, unexpectedly warm weather during the
            heating season and ideal harvest conditions, as observed in the
            subsequent two&nbsp;years, can cause prices to fall. This is
            reflected in the price fluctuations shown in
            <a href="#f8_1">Figure&nbsp;8.1</a> and
            <a href="#f8_2">Figure&nbsp;8.2</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Canada and the U.S. have not seen a repeat of the extreme polar
            vortex witnessed in winter&nbsp;2013/14. For the most part, the
            warmer 2014/15 and 2015/16 winters resulted in less winter
            consumption of propane, and higher inventories following the heating
            season.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite high U.S. corn harvests in 2014 and 2015 (14.2&nbsp;billion
            and 13.6&nbsp;billion&nbsp;bushels, respectively), crop drying
            demand for propane was lower than it was in 2013. U.S. Midwest
            propane inventories during the crop drying season from early October
            2013 to early January 2014 declined 48&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. This
            significant inventory decline aggravated supply issues during the
            polar vortex. By comparison, U.S. Midwest propane inventories
            declined only six&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from early October 2014 to
            early January 2015 and seven&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from early October
            2015 to early January 2016.

          <h2 id="s10">10. Midstream and Downstream Developments</h2>
          <h3>Western Canada</h3>
          <p>
            The Cochin Pipeline stopped receiving propane at the end of March
            2014 and was operating in condensate import service for the oil
            sands diluent market by July 2014. Prior to this reversal, when the
            line was flowing propane from Alberta to the U.S. Midwest and
            Ontario, Cochin’s average utilization between 2012 and 2014 was
            45&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (approximately 32 Mb/d). Now that Cochin
            delivers condensate to the Alberta oil sands, its utilization
            averages 85&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (approximately 80 Mb/d).
          </p>
          <p>
            The reversal of Cochin has placed greater emphasis on using rail to
            transport Canadian propane to market. Also, whereas Cochin primarily
            served the U.S. Midwest and Ontario markets, propane moved by rail
            can access markets across Canada and the U.S.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keyera’s Josephburg rail terminal near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta
            was completed in July 2015. The terminal has a loading capacity of
            40 Mb/d and has the flexibility to handle butanes in addition to
            propane. Keyera also has plans to add 35 Mb/d of propane-plus
            fractionation<sup id="fn18-rf"

            capacity at its Fort Saskatchewan facility, with an anticipated
            completion date at the end of the second quarter of 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plains Midstream Canada commenced Phase II of its Fort Saskatchewan
            Facility Expansion in late 2014. The expansion will include
            construction of a loading terminal with capacity of 60 rail cars per
            day (approximately 45 Mb/d). The expansion also involves
            debottlenecking of the Plains fractionator, increasing inlet
            capacity from 65 Mb/d to 85 Mb/d, and development of three new
            underground natural gas liquids storage caverns with capacity of
            2.2&nbsp;MMb.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pembina’s RFS II project involves expansion of the Redwater
            Fractionator and Storage facility in Redwater, Alberta (north of
            Edmonton). The project includes a 73 Mb/d ethane-plus fractionator
            and is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2016. The
            RFS III project, scheduled for late 2017, will involve construction
            of a third fractionator to process 55 Mb/d of propane-plus mix.
            Ongoing cavern development at Redwater has also increased propane
            storage capacity since 2014.
          </p>
          <h3>Ontario and Eastern Canada</h3>
          <p>
            Ontario is the largest residential propane consuming region in
            Canada. Following issues encountered during winter&nbsp;2013/14,
            infrastructure investments were made to improve the receipt and
            delivery of propane. NGL Supply’s Putnam Terminal in Dorchester,
            Ontario started operations in August 2015 with rail offloading
            capabilities and 60&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gallons of storage
            (1&nbsp;430&nbsp;barrels). In October 2015, Factor Gas Liquids, in
            partnership with Dowler Karn, established the St. Thomas Propane
            Terminal in southwestern Ontario. The terminal is capable of
            unloading six rail cars per day into a
            90&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gallons (2&nbsp;145&nbsp;barrels)
            storage tank, and loading a 405 barrel capacity Super B truck in 25
            to 30&nbsp;minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, retailers have also invested in above-ground storage.
            Stinson and Sons expanded storage capabilities in Arnprior, Ontario
            in 2015. Budget Propane is planning to double storage capacity in
            Cornwall, Ontario in 2016. In Winchester, Ontario, Guy Fuels is
            installing 30&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gallons
            (714&nbsp;barrels) of storage. To improve retail delivery
            efficiency, Parkland and Superior Propane implemented new truck
            routing systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Midstream companies in Ontario have also made trucking upgrades,
            including a new truck loading rack at Pembina’s Corunna storage
            facility in early 2016, and a re-commissioned truck loading rack at
            Imperial Oil’s Sarnia facility in the fall of 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, in eastern Canada, a new terminal operated by Wilsons with
            rail offloading and truck loading started operation in Moncton, New
            Brunswick. The Wilsons terminal also includes
            120&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;gallons (2&nbsp;860&nbsp;barrels)
            of storage capacity.

          <h2 id="s11">11. Future Canadian Propane Market Developments</h2>
          <h3>Propane Demand in Alberta</h3>
          <p>
            In February 2016, the Alberta government launched the Petrochemicals
            Diversification Program.<sup id="fn19-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn19"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>19</a
              ></sup
            >
            The program offers $500&nbsp;million in royalty credits to select
            petrochemical facilities that apply through a competitive process.
            As petrochemical facilities cannot benefit directly from royalty
            credits because they do not pay royalties, the credits would be
            traded or sold to an oil or natural gas producer who would then use
            the credits to reduce royalty payments to the Alberta government.
            The program targets the value-added use of methane and propane with
            the goal of attracting $3-5&nbsp;billion of investment in energy
            processing to Alberta.

            Williams’ continues to move ahead with its proposed propane
            dehydrogenation (PDH) unit in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. The PDH
            unit would consume approximately 20 Mb/d of western Canadian propane
            and produce propylene. An off-take agreement for the propylene was
            signed in 2015 with North American Polypropylene. A final investment
            decision is planned for late 2016, with operational start-up planned
            for 2019.

          <h3>Long-Term Propane Exports</h3>
          <p>
            Three long-term Canadian propane export projects are currently
            proposed by Pembina, AltaGas, and Petrogas Energy Corp. The AltaGas
            and Petrogras propane export licence applications are currently
            before the Board, and this propane market update does not provide an
            indication about whether these applications will be approved or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            In November 2015, the Board approved Pembina’s application to export
            up to 75 Mb/d of propane from Canada for a period of 25&nbsp;years.
            The export facility was planned for Portland, Oregon. However, in
            February 2016, Pembina decided that it would no longer pursue the
            Portland location and will now evaluate other sites on the West
            Coast.<sup id="fn20-rf"

          </p>
          <p>
            In February 2016, AltaGas applied to the Board for a 25&nbsp;year
            licence to export up to 46 Mb/d of propane from a terminal located
            in Prince Rupert, B.C.<sup id="fn21-rf"

              ></sup
            >
            Propane would be shipped to the terminal by rail. AltaGas has stated
            that if it receives all required regulatory approvals, AltaGas
            expects to reach a final investment decision later in 2016 with
            first exports targeted for 2018.<sup id="fn22-rf"

          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, in March 2016, Petrogas Energy Corp. applied to the Board
            for a 25&nbsp;year&nbsp;licence to export up to 107 Mb/d of propane
            from Canada.<sup id="fn23-rf"

          <h2 id="s12">12. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The propane market in Canada and the U.S. has undergone substantial
            changes since 2014. While some trends noted in the Final Report
            continue, especially strong growth in U.S. propane production and
            U.S. exports, other circumstances have changed. High production and
            storage, coupled with weak seasonal demand, caused wholesale propane
            prices to decline to 14-year lows at most hubs, and record lows in
            Edmonton. Retail propane prices have also declined.
          </p>
          <p>
            This decline in prices supports the Final Report’s conclusion (<a
              href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/crude-petroleum/15927#conclusions"
              rel="external"

          <ul class="list-unstyled ">
            <li>
              <em
                >... price increases and initial local shortages are not
                indicative of long-term supply-demand imbalances in the Canadian
                propane industry. Short-term propane prices have historically
                been volatile due to the industry’s traditional combination of
                steady supply, fluctuating demand, and complex logistics. While
                there is sufficient production, storage, and transportation
                infrastructure to meet the future needs of Canadians,
                utilization of this infrastructure throughout the year is often
                based on market expectations of variables such as weather.
                Accordingly, temporary price spikes and shortages are likely in
                the future. No other factors are expected to exacerbate these
                challenges or contribute to future shortages and price
                increases.</em

          <p>
            In other words, despite concerns during winter&nbsp;2013/14 that
            prices might remain high and supply low because of structural issues
            in the propane market, the events of the last two&nbsp;years
            indicate otherwise. Furthermore, these events illustrate that the
            propane market can bmovemente highly volatile in multiple ways, with
            prices and supply potentially having large fluctuations in both
            directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Canadian propane industry appears to have become more cautious
            in response to the 2013/14 polar vortex-driven price spike.
            Midstream and downstream companies have made (and are continuing to
            make) investments in transportation infrastructure to facilitate of
            propane from producing regions and storage facilities to
            distribution terminals and consumers. The Canadian propane industry
            is also looking for new markets and sources of demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board remains committed to monitoring propane market
            developments and keeping Canadians informed about these developments
            through Market Snapshots, price updates, and publications such as
            this update.

                  The projections in <em>Canada’s Energy Future</em> are a

                  of a variety of possible outcomes, and do not represent the
                  Board’s predictions of what will take place in the future.

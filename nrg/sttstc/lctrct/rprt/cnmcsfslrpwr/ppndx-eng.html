                  Residential-scale of 5&nbsp;kW, to model roof-top arrays
                  supplying power to a home.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Commercial-scale of 200&nbsp;kW, to model medium-sized
                  facilities providing power for large businesses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Utility-scale of 50 MW, to model large facilities providing
                  power to the grid.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Community-scale of 200&nbsp;kW, to model medium-sized
                  facilities providing power to a neighborhood or to a civic
                  building, such as a recreation centre. Importantly, the
                  facility is assumed to be a non-profit, which has tax
                  implications, and is the reason why community-scale is modeled
                  separately from commercial-scale.

                because of snow cover, though some gains from reflected light
                were included, as estimated from the closest CWEC albedo data.
                Soiling was assumed to reduce output by 5% year round. The same
                NSRDB dataset includes hourly temperatures, which were also used
                in the model.

                was used to determine the conversion of solar irradiance to
                electricity, as estimated from NREL models of panel performance.
                Panels were assumed to face due south to maximize sunlight
                received. Panel tilt for commercial-, community-, and
                utility-scale arrays was latitude minus nine degrees.<sup

                Rooftop panels were tilted at 27 degrees, a normal slope for

                Residential-, commercial-, and community-scale arrays were
                assumed to have fixed mounts (i.e., panels do not rotate as the
                sun moves in the sky). Utility-scale projects were modeled in
                two ways: one way with fixed mounts and the other with
                single-axis trackers (which could rotate a maximum of 90 degrees
                on their axes). Angles of incidence for arrays were estimated
                using NREL equations.<sup id="fn12-rf"

                Small losses were included for early- and late-day shading.
                Small losses were also included for wiring (AC and DC), module
                mismatch, and inverter loss to convert DC to AC. Line losses for
                utility-scale arrays varied by province as based on provincial
                tariffs. Panel performance was assumed to degrade by 0.5% per
                year over the life of the project. NSRDB hourly temperatures
                were used to adjust panel performance.

                of all types of arrays, new inverters were assumed to be
                installed. Half way through the life of utility-scale arrays
                with trackers, new trackers were assumed to be installed. At the
                end of 25 years, an additional capital expense of remediation
                was applied. The residual value of panels after 25 years was 25%
                of their original cost. The residual value of other equipment
                was assumed to be 15%.

                Land costs for utility-scale solar arrays were based on
                Statistics Canada estimates of farm land and building values in
                each province.<sup id="fn13-rf"

                Importantly, costs were increased in some areas (for example,
                Southern Ontario and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia)
                because of high demand for real estate. Land costs for
                commercial, community, and residential were assumed to be zero,
                because the systems would be installed on an existing rooftop or
                property already owned.

              <p><strong>Tariffs, transmission, and operating costs</strong></p>
              <p>
                The analysis includes two scenarios for connecting utility-scale
                solar facilities into transmission systems: one with provincial
                open-access transmission tariffs (OATTs) applied, and another
                without them, to better understand tariff costs and how the
                economics of power-purchase agreements might differ from
                independent producers (or if large utility-scale arrays produce
                into local distribution systems instead of into transmission
                systems). Tariffs can be lower than indicated here if generation
                is part of a portfolio and the operating-reserve services, which
                pay for backup generation in the event of an outage, come from
                the portfolio rather than paying the transmission provider for
                them.

                Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut do not currently
                have tariffs, because they do not produce electricity into the
                North American market. Newfoundland and Labrador is currently
                developing an OATT. Alberta&rsquo;s tariff is based on the
                Alberta Electric System Operator&rsquo;s (AESO&rsquo;s)
                connection costs, the AESO&rsquo;s rate supply transmission
                service, and an estimate of the AESO&rsquo;s construction and
                generator&rsquo;s contribution financed over 25 years.

                Income taxes were subtracted from revenues as based on federal
                and provincial corporate-tax rates for utility-scale facilities.
                Residential-scale facilities paid sales taxes for the value of
                electricity returned to the grid for credits, because sales
                taxes are still paid on the electricity consumed in later months
                before any credit is applied. Community-scale facilities paid no
                income taxes, because they were assumed to be non-profit.
                Commercial-scale facilities paid no income tax, because it was
                assumed all electricity would be consumed on site. No carbon
                taxes were applied to any type of project.

                were deducted from income taxes for utility-scale facilities.
                CCA deductions were not applied to commercial-scale facilities,
                because it was assumed all electricity would be consumed onsite,
                thus no income taxes were to be paid on electricity generated.
                For residential-scale and commercial-scale projects, sales taxes
                were applied to all capital costs. For utility-scale projects
                sales taxes were only applied to equipment and installation. No
                sales taxes were applied to the capital costs of community-scale
                projects, which were assumed to be non-profit.

              <p><strong>Hourly Pricing</strong></p>
              <p>Two pricing scenarios were used:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  flat pricing (i.e., with no hourly variation). Many
                  residential, commercial, and community consumers pay flat
                  rates for their electricity. Flat pricing was also examined
                  for utility-scale facilities, because the difference between
                  it and &ldquo;time of day pricing&rdquo; can help show the
                  premium that time-of-day pricing earns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Time-of-day pricing, because solar generates electricity
                  during daylight hours, when demand is highest and electricity
                  has the most value. Time-of-day pricing helps show the premium
                  that solar projects earn, including utility-scale. Meanwhile,
                  provinces are increasingly rolling out smart meters to homes
                  and businesses so that utilities can measure consumption by
                  time of day and apply time-of-day rates to consumption.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                To model time-of-day pricing, typical off-peak, mid-peak, and
                on-peak price discounts and premiums were determined by
                comparing hourly prices to average, daily prices for winter and
                summer days and on a wholesale-price and residential-price
                basis. However, only two provinces (Ontario and Alberta) have
                wholesale markets from which to make these estimates. Meanwhile,
                only Ontario and Nova Scotia have time-of-day residential rates.
                Thus, because of the lack of data, the hourly discounts and
                premiums from some provinces were applied to others.

                consumption of equal value when the solar array wasn&rsquo;t
                producing as much electricity, such as in the winter. The values

              <p>
                Comparable electricity prices for residential-scale solar were
                determined from residential energy charges and other variable
                charges published by provincial and territorial utilities and
                electricity providers. In Ontario and Alberta, multiple cities
                were averaged to determine the comparable electricity price.
                These prices do not include fixed charges, which stay the same
                on every bill no matter how much electricity is consumed. Thus,
                buying residential electricity from local utilities is slightly
                more expensive than indicated here.

                electricity-price surveys were averaged for each province. It
                was assumed 200 MW.h of electricity is assumed monthly at
                500&nbsp;kW of peak demand. It was also assumed that
                transformation was utility owned. For the territories, energy
                charges published by local utilities were used.
              </p>
              <p>
                For utility-scale projects, the average, annual wholesale
                electricity price was used for the comparable electricity price
                in Ontario and Alberta, the only two provinces with wholesale
                markets. Otherwise, reseller rates or large industry energy
                charges were used, because these would be the next best estimate
                of what wholesale pricing is, though could still be higher than
                the real cost of generation.

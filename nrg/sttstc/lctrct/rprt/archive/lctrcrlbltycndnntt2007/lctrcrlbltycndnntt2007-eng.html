        <p>This report is undertaken pursuant to the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task 
        Force recommendations, specifically Recommendation&nbsp;10. In the <em>Final
        Report on Implementation of the Task Force Recommendations</em>, September&nbsp;2006 (Final Report), it was indicated that &quot;in Canada, the NEB has agreed to prepare a report documenting the reliability 
        information now being collected, the methodologies used, and any gaps or difficulties 
        in the collection of information.&quot; This report fulfils the National Energy Board's 
        (NEB's) undertaking in the Final Report.</p>
        <p>We wish to acknowledge the cooperation from those entities and individuals supplying

        <h2 id="ses">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>On 14&nbsp;August&nbsp;2003, Ontario and parts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest experienced an electric power blackout that affected about 50&nbsp;million people. In its April&nbsp;2004 report on the causes of this event, the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force 
        made 46&nbsp;recommendations toward ensuring the reliability of the North American bulk 
        power system in the years to come. Recommendation&nbsp;10 identified the need to compile 
        information that would enable the monitoring of reliability performance. In the <em>Final
        Report on the Implementation of the Task Force Report Recommendations</em>, September&nbsp;2006, (Final Report) it was stated in regard to Recommendation&nbsp;10 that, in Canada, the NEB would prepare a report documenting the reliability information being collected, the 
        methodologies being used, and the gaps or difficulties in the collection of information. 
        The Final Report indicated that full implementation of Recommendation&nbsp;10 would require sustained attention from government agencies for several years.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[1] <em>U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force, Final Report on the Implementation of the Task Force Report Recommendations</em>, September&nbsp;2006,
        P.&nbsp;15.</p>
        <p>This report fulfils the NEB's undertaking in the Final Report with respect to 
        Recommendation&nbsp;10. It indicates there is substantial reliability information currently 
        being reported by Canadian entities (e.g., integrated electric utilities, independent 
        transmission and generation companies and system operators) to the provinces, the 
        Canadian Electricity Association and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation 
        (NERC). Reporting to NERC, consistent with NERC's mandate to implement mandatory 
        reliability standards and monitor compliance, has the advantage of comprehensive and 
        standardized reporting for Canadian and U.S. entities, which together influence the 
        reliability of the interconnected Canadian and U.S. bulk power systems.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest gap is that currently there is little readily available information 
        that tracks trends in bulk power system reliability performance in Canada or, for 
        that matter, in the U.S. This is not because the information, or data, is not reported, 
        but because it is not readily displayed for public use. Compiling reliability performance 
        information to enable an assessment of reliability trends would be useful to industry, 
        regulators, policy makers and the public.</p>
        <p>So far, reliability information compiled by NERC has mainly focused on compliance
        with reliability standards; however, this is not necessarily the same as indicating
        trends in reliability performance. Monitoring reliability performance directly -&nbsp;by
        the systematic development of standard indicators such as the frequency and duration
        of transmission system interruptions, trends in reserve margins and incidences of
        compliance violations&nbsp; - may provide indications about the effectiveness of
        NERC and the power industry in improving reliability and the effects of actions taken
        when problems are identified. Recent initiatives by NERC, including the development
        of its Information Reliability Dashboard and Transmission Availability Data System
        would appear to take significant steps in that direction.</p>
        <p>This report concludes that since the report on the causes of the August&nbsp;2003 blackout 
        was issued, substantial steps have been taken to improve the reliability of the North 
        American bulk power system, the major initiative being the implementation of mandatory 
        electric reliability standards. Establishing an independent source of reliability 
        performance information has not advanced as quickly. However, efforts undertaken to 
        date by NERC, which is recognized in the U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions as the Electric 
        Reliability Organization, seem directed toward meeting this need. Therefore, from 
        the NEB's perspective, the need for another entity to provide an independent 
        source of reliability information in Canada is not justified at this time.</p>

        <h2 id="s1">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>On 14&nbsp;August&nbsp;2003, Ontario and parts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest experienced 
        an electric power blackout that affected an area that services about 50&nbsp;million people. 
        Some areas were without power or experienced rotating blackouts for up to a week or 
        so after the initial failure. In April&nbsp;2004 report on this event, the U.S.-Canada 
        Power System Outage Task Force (Task Force) made 46 recommendations toward ensuring 
        the reliability of the North American bulk power system in the years to come. Among 
        the recommendations pertaining to institutional matters, the Task Force identified 
        the need to compile information that would enable the monitoring of reliability performance. 
        Recommendation&nbsp;10 states:</p>
        <div class="mrgn-lft-md">
          <p><strong>&quot;10. Establish an independent source of reliability performance information.&quot;</strong></p>
          <p>&quot;The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), in coordination
          with other interested agencies and data sources (FERC, appropriate Canadian government
          agencies, NERC, RTOs, ISOs, the regional councils, transmission operators and generators)
          should establish common definitions and information collection standards. If the
          necessary resources can be identified, EIA should expand its current activities to
          include information on reliability performance.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup></p>
        </div>
        <p class="small "> [2] <em>U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force, August 14th Blackout: Causes and Recommendations</em>, April&nbsp;2004, PP.&nbsp;1, 141, 147. The Task Force made recommendations in three areas: Group&nbsp;I. Institutional Issues Related to Reliability; Group&nbsp;II. Support and Strengthen NERC's Actions of February&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2004; and Group&nbsp;III. Physical and Cyber Security of North American Bulk Power Systems.</p>
        <p>Recommendation&nbsp;10 refers to reliability information for the bulk power system, 
        the network of generating stations and transmission systems that compose the interconnected 
        grid. Thus, it does not address information pertaining to local distribution systems, 
        which is where the impact of service interruptions is experienced by most consumers. 
        Nevertheless, performance of the bulk power system is an obvious precursor in determining 
        the final reliability outcome, particularly in preventing cascading power outages, 
        as occurred in August&nbsp;2003.</p>
        <p>In the September&nbsp;2006 Final Report it was stated in regard to Recommendation&nbsp;10 
        that:</p>
        <div class="mrgn-lft-md">
          <p>&quot;In the United States, two recent government-sponsored reports have stressed 
          the need for a more systematic collection, analysis and publication of reliability 
          data and information. FERC, DOE, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and 
          NERC need to agree on what data should be collected by whom, and what analyses of 
          reliability data should be published routinely and by which organization.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;In Canada, the NEB has agreed to prepare a report documenting the reliability 
          information now being collected, the methodologies being used, and the gaps or difficulties 
          in the collection of information.&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Final Report also indicated that full implementation of Recommendation&nbsp;10
        will require sustained attention from government agencies for several years.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[3]<em> U.S.-Canada Power System
        Outage Task Force, Final Report on the Implementation of the Task Force Recommendations</em>, September&nbsp;2006, P.&nbsp;15. The two reports in the U.S. are <em>Electricity Transmission in a Restructured Industry: Data Needs for Public Policy Analysis</em>, U.S. DOE, December&nbsp;2004, and a report on reliability metrics being used by a sample of U.S. transmission companies (by the Lawrence&nbsp;B. Berkeley Laboratory, forthcoming as of June&nbsp;2007).</p>
        <p>This report fulfils the NEB's undertaking in the Final Report in respect to 
        Recommendation&nbsp;10. A main objective is to describe the type of reliability information 
        that is currently being reported by Canadian entities (e.g., integrated electric utilities, 
        independent transmission and generation companies and system operators); this perspective 
        is provided in section&nbsp;2. Section&nbsp;3 provides an assessment of the information and 
        gaps in the context of Recommendation&nbsp;10. Section&nbsp;4 presents conclusions.</p>
        <p> This report is not intended to assess current or recent trends in electric reliability.
        However, the information referred to here, either in its current form or some variation,
        may eventually be used for that purpose.</p>

        <h2 id="s2">2. Current Status of Reporting by Canadian Entities on Electric Reliability</h2>
        <p>This section focuses on the reporting of reliability information by Canadian entities 
        to the federal and provincial governments, the CEA and NERC.</p>
        <h3 id="s2_1">2.1 Federal Government</h3>
        <p>There is no ongoing requirement to report information on electric reliability to 
        the federal government. Electric utilities do report on some of the operational and 
        financial aspects of the electric power industry to Statistics Canada. Statistics 
        Canada could possibly expand its current surveys, or develop a new one, to collect 
        information on reliability.</p>
        <p>In order to design a new survey, relevant stakeholders including industry, regulators
        and policy makers would need to be consulted to decide on such matters as the specific
        information to be collected, the amount of regional detail and the frequency of
        reporting and publication. There could also be an issue associated with the need
        and relevance of national reporting, given that the power systems in Canada are
        largely under provincial jurisdiction. Assuming the reporting requirements can be
        identified and standardized across provinces, it could take several years to implement
        a new survey.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[4] This follows from communications with Statistics
        Canada staff.</p>
        <h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Provincial Governments</h3>
        <p>There are some requirements for entities with generation and transmission operations
        to report reliability information to provincial governments and more directly to
        the provincial regulators. However, there is little consistency among the provinces
        on how information is reported, and the amount that is easily accessible to the
        public also varies.<sup>[5]</sup> Several integrated utilities report bottom-line
        indexes of reliability at the consumer level (e.g., in their annual reports), but
        little information on the performance of the bulk system. In Ontario, where transmission,
        generation and distribution have been unbundled, the IESO market rules and transmission
        
        code require that Hydro One, the main transmission company in that province, report
        reliability information on a regular basis. This includes such information as voltage
        variations, flicker (power quality), power outage notification, emergency events
        and system performance at customer delivery points. BCTC, the main transmission
        company in British Columbia, reports such information as reserve management, voltage
        control, outage management (planned and unplanned) and data on power flows.</p>
        <p class="small ">[5] This section is based mainly on a survey of
        web sites of the provincial regulators, and also draws on observations made in the
        NEB's <em>Compendium of Electric Reliability Frameworks in Canada</em>, June&nbsp;2004 (e.g., see PP.&nbsp;4, 48).</p>
        <h3 id="s2_3">2.3 Canadian Electricity Association (CEA)</h3>
        <p>CEA members report reliability information that is compiled and released by the CEA in three annual publications.</p>
        <p> A report on forced outages for transmission equipment includes information on
        the number of outages and duration for transmission lines, transformer banks and
        other major transmission elements. The 2004 version of that report (published in&nbsp;2006)
        covers the 5-year period ending&nbsp;2004.<sup>[6]</sup> Data are displayed at the
        national level for CEA member utilities based on the CEA's Equipment Reliability
        Information System. Utilities providing information receive the detail for each submitter
        in addition to the national data.</p>
        <p class="small ">[6] <em>2004 Forced Outage Performance of Transmission Equipment, For the Period January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000 to December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2004</em>, CEA, 2006</p>
        <p>A report on the status of generation equipment contains data on over 850 generating
        units in Canada, including: the distributions of the generating units by age and
        maximum continuous rating; a summary of the unit types and operating experience;
        the top five causes of outages; and the top ten generating unit performers for the
        year. Detail is provided on operating factors by unit and fuel types, along with
        outage and cause statistics.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[7] <em>2005 Generation Equipment
        Status Annual Report</em>, CEA, July&nbsp;2007</p>
        <p>A report on the performance of distribution systems provides historical data,
        for the most recent 5-6 years, including the relatively well known SAIDI, SAIFI
        and CAIDI indexes; these measure the duration and frequency of system and customer
        outages.<sup>[8]</sup> The report also produces the annual Index of Reliability, which
        indicates the overall availability of the distribution system on an annual basis.
        The data are based on CEA member utilities, which account for almost all power distribution
        in Canada. Data are available to the public on a national basis. Details of submitters
        are made available to submitting utilities. Some international comparisons are included.<sup>[9]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[8] SAIDI refers to the system average interruption
        duration index (the number of hours of service interruptions per customer in a given
        year). SAIFI refers to the system average interruption frequency index (the number
        of service interruptions per customer in a given year). CAIDI refers to the customer
        average interruption duration index (hours per service interruption in a given year).<br>

        <h3 id="s2_4">2.4 NERC Reporting Requirements</h3>
        <p>Background</p>
        <p>NERC is currently composed of eight regional reliability organizations (RROs) in 
        Canada, the U.S. and Baja California Norte, Mexico (<a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a>).</p>
        <p>Effective 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2007, NERC commenced operations as the Electric
        Reliability Organization (ERO) and assumed the responsibilities for electric reliability
        from its predecessor, the North American Electric Reliability Council.<sup>[10]</sup> NERC is
        responsible for implementing mandatory reliability standards. It is subject to regulatory
        oversight by the FERC in the U.S. and is recognized by the NEB and provincial authorities
        in Canada. The key difference between NERC today and the previous organization is
        that compliance with reliability standards was largely voluntary, although subject
        to &quot;peer&nbsp;pressure.&quot;</p>
        <p class="small ">[10] &quot;NERC&quot; refers to both the North American
        Electric Reliability Corporation (effective 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2007) and its predecessor,
        the North American Electric Reliability Council.</p>
        <p>&quot;NERC's mission is to improve the reliability and security of the bulk 
        power system in North America. To achieve that, NERC develops and enforces reliability
        standards; monitors the bulk power system; assesses future adequacy; audits owners,
        operators, and users for preparedness; and educates and trains industry personnel.
        NERC is a self-regulatory organization that relies on the diverse and collective
        expertise of industry participants.&quot;<sup>[11]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[11] <a href="http://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a></p>
        <p>Consistent with NERC's mission, Canadian entities, along with their U.S. 
        and Mexican counterparts, have for many years reported reliability information to 
        NERC. In essence, reporting entities provide information to their respective RROs 
        which then report to NERC's headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey. To provide 
        some perspective on the extent and significance of that reporting, a brief overview 
        of NERC's activities in developing reliability standards and monitoring compliance 
        follows.</p>
        <h4>Reliability Standards</h4>
        <p>NERC currently has 12 categories of reliability standards. Generally speaking,
        the standards measure the real time operation of the grid, &quot;operating reliability,&quot; 
        and assess longer-term anticipated growth in electric generation and transmission
        relative to anticipated load (demand) growth, or &quot;resource adequacy.&quot;<sup>[12]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[12] In developing its standards NERC has adopted and
        follows the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) process. Two essential
        criteria for mandatory reliability standards, which will be subject to financial
        penalties, are that they be clear and measurable.</p>
        <p>The 12&nbsp;categories of standards are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resource and Demand Balancing (BAL)</li>
          <li>Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)</li>
          <li>Communications (COM)</li>
          <li>Emergency Preparedness and Operations (EOP)</li>
          <li>Facilities Design, Connections and Maintenance (FAC)</li>
          <li>Interchange, Scheduling and Coordination (INT)</li>
          <li>Interconnection Reliability Operations and Coordination (IRO)</li>
          <li>Modeling, Data and Analysis (MOD)</li>
          <li>Organization Certification (ORG)</li>
          <li>Personal Performance, Training and Qualifications (PER)</li>
          <li>Protection and Control (PRC)</li>
          <li>Transmission Operations (TOP)</li>
          <li>Transmission Planning (TPL)</li>
          <li>Voltage and Reactive (VAR)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As of mid-2006, NERC had 107&nbsp;standards in these categories.</p>
        <p>An integral part of implementing standards is monitoring to gauge compliance; thus, 
        regular reporting by participants in Canada and the U.S. is required. The main tools 
        that NERC has to monitor reliability are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quarterly and Annual compliance reports</li>
          <li>Summer/Winter Reliability Assessments and Long-term Assessments (10&nbsp;years)</li>
          <li>System Disturbance Reports </li>
          <li>Reliability audits (including readiness audits).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Quarterly and Annual Compliance Reports</strong></p>
        <p>These reports are comprised of data and other information initially compiled at 
        the regional level by the RROs, and then assembled for quarterly and annual publication 
        at the NERC web site. Highlights have also been discussed at Stakeholder Meetings 
        (now the Members Representatives Committee) and the public meetings of the Board of 
        Trustees.</p>
        <p>Examples of data portrayed in the 2005 annual report include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>compliance with reliability standards, by region (96&nbsp;percent compliant in&nbsp;2005)</li>
          <li>confirmed violations and severity of violations (on a scale of 1 through 4,
          with 4 being most severe)</li>
          <li> report on specific aspects of reliability standards; in the&nbsp;2005 report, special
          attention was given to vegetation-related transmission outages</li>
          <li>other information included developments with respect to cyber security and audits
          of regional compliance programs</li>
          <li>progress on recommendations from the previous year's report.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NERC reported on the extent of compliance with 40&nbsp;standards in&nbsp;2004
        and 44&nbsp;standards 
        in&nbsp;2005.<sup>[13]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[13] <em>NERC Compliance Enforcement Program
        2005 Summary Report</em>, July&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2006. These standards
        are monitored directly by NERC; the RROs report to NERC on these and monitor other
        standards as well.</p>
        <p>The regional compliance results are audited by NERC staff through periodic audits
        of the processes used by the RROs, which in turn audit the reporting entities in
        their respective areas.<sup>[14]</sup> Ultimately, the goal of the compliance program
        is to improve reliability through monitoring compliance, and identifying areas for
        improvement with follow-up actions.</p>
        <p class="small ">[14]&nbsp;For example, refer to the WECC <em>Compliance Enforcement Program Audit</em>, November 30, 2006.</p>
        <p><strong>Reliability Assessment Reports</strong></p>
        <p>Each year, NERC publishes a summer outlook and winter outlook reporting on the 
        adequacy of generation and transmission, by region. It also publishes a long-term 
        outlook for the next 10&nbsp;years. The reports are prepared by the RROs and then rolled 
        up by NERC to provide a North American overview. A main purpose is to identify areas 
        where new transmission and generation may be required in order to prevent reserve 
        margins from falling below the levels required to maintain reliability.</p>
        <p>Data required for these reports include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>forecasted peak demands</li>
          <li>forecasted capacity resources </li>
          <li>generating facility additions, retirements and re-ratings</li>
          <li>transmission facility additions, retirements, and re-ratings</li>
          <li>fuel requirements</li>
          <li>write-ups addressing specific issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional detail is provided in of <a href="#nnx2">Appendix&nbsp;2</a> this report.</p>
        <p><strong>Disturbance Reporting</strong><sup>[15]</sup></p>
        <p>Reporting on system disturbances is contained in a data base maintained by NERC's 
        Disturbance Analysis Working Group. The database records major electric utility system 
        disturbances reported to the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE) and NERC. The U.S. 
        DOE requires electric utilities to report system emergencies that include electric 
        service interruptions, voltage reductions, acts of sabotage, unusual occurrences that 
        can affect the reliability of the bulk electric systems, and fuel problems. When a 
        utility experiences an electric system emergency, the utility sends a copy of the 
        report to its RRO, which then sends a copy to NERC. Canadian utilities have often 
        voluntarily filed emergency reports with the U.S. DOE and the RROs.</p>
        <p class="small ">[15] This section is summarized from the description
        of disturbance reporting at the <a href="http://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a> web site.</p>
        <p>NERC has published its findings on bulk electric system disturbances, demand reductions,
        and unusual occurrences since 1979 in reports entitled System Disturbances. The
        objectives of these reports include sharing the experiences and lessons of North
        American utilities and determining whether the reliability standards adequately
        address the normal and emergency conditions that can occur on the bulk electric
        systems.<sup>[16]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[16] Events are reported as they occur, and are
        compiled in annual reports at the <a href="http://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a> web site.</p>
        <p><strong>Readiness Audits</strong></p>
        <p>The readiness audits are separate from NERC compliance audits, which measure compliance 
        with NERC reliability standards. The intent of the readiness audits is to ensure that 
        operators of the bulk electric system have the tools, processes, and procedures in 
        place to operate reliably. The audits help balancing authorities, transmission operators, 
        and reliability coordinators recognize and assess their reliability responsibilities 
        and evaluate how their operations support those responsibilities. NERC uses the results 
        of these audits to identify best practices and to promote changes required to improve 
        reliability performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Recent NERC Initiatives</strong></p>
        <p>As part of compliance reporting, NERC collects substantial information on grid
        operations, including real time data on power flows, power system voltages and frequencies,
        and the ability of systems at any point in time to handle contingencies based on
        the availability of generation reserves and transmission capacity. This information
        is being used in developing NERC's Reliability Metrics and Benchmarking program 
        and developing indicators for display on its Reliability Information Dashboard (<a href="#nnx3">Appendix&nbsp;3</a>).<sup>[17]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[17] <a href="http://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a>.
        Go to site map/NERC Fast Links/ Reliability Information Dashboard.</p>
        <p>Related to performance metrics, NERC has recently developed the Transmission Availability 
        Data System (TADS), which will collect such data as outage frequency and duration, 
        mean time between failures and percent availability.<sup>[18]</sup> Subject to approval
        by the NERC Board of Trustees, the system is planned to be implemented in&nbsp;2008.
        NERC will publish a public annual report that will show the results for each RRO
        and a confidential report will be produced for each transmission owner.</p>
        <p class="small ">[18] <em>Transmission Availability
        Data System Final Report</em>, by the Transmission Availability System Task Force, 
        June&nbsp;2007. The 13-member Task Force was chaired by Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie and had representation from the Canadian Electricity Association.</p>
        <p>To some extent, these initiatives toward developing performance metrics are motivated 
        by FERC's final rule on the ERO, which includes a requirement for NERC to periodically
        provide the Commission with reports on the &quot;Reliable Operation of the Bulk- 
        Power System&quot; and &quot;assessments of the adequacy of the Bulk-Power System.&quot;<sup>[19]</sup> Along with its reliability assessment reports, NERC is undertaking to meet these
        requirements.</p>
        <p class="small ">[19] FERC Order&nbsp;672, February&nbsp;3, 2006, P.&nbsp;307</p>
        <p><strong>Reporting by Canadian Entities to the RROs</strong></p>
        <p>Reporting by Canadian entities occurs on a regional basis to three NERC regional 
        organizations: the NPCC for the Maritimes, Qu&eacute;bec and Ontario; the MRO for 
        Manitoba and Saskatchewan; and the WECC for Alberta and British Columbia. Depending 
        on the province, the reporting entities may be transmission companies, integrated 
        utilities or system operators. The reporting requirements for the Canadian and U.S. 
        entities to a given RRO are the same.</p>
        <p>Entities reporting to NPCC account for about 70&nbsp;percent of the Canadian net energy
        for load, compared with 22&nbsp;percent for WECC and 8&nbsp;percent for the MRO.<sup>[20]</sup> The
        reporting relationships are indicated in the following schematic.</p>
        <p class="small ">[20] On a regional basis, net energy for load (NEL)&nbsp;=
        (regional generation) - (electricity transfers from the region) + (electricity
        transfers into the region). NEL includes power losses.</p>
        <img src="/nrg/sttstc/lctrct/rprt/archive/lctrcrlbltycndnntt2007/mg/mg01-eng.jpg" alt="Reporting by Canadian Entities to Regional Reliability Organizations and NERC" class="center-block mrgn-bttm-md">
        <p>To more clearly understand the type of data that NERC and RROs gather from industry, 
        informal requests were sent from NEB staff to the three regional organizations pertaining to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the name of the Canadian entities supplying the information</li>
          <li>the data/information required</li>
          <li>the frequency (e.g., real time, monthly, quarterly, annual, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because the data are mainly collected in compliance with the reliability standards, 
        they are reported by standard (<a href="#nnx4">Appendix&nbsp;4</a>). The data and other information are then compiled and analyzed to produce the compliance and other reports referred to earlier. 
        Differences in reporting between the regions arise from additional requirements in 
        the regions (e.g., special studies) or differences in the regional compliance programs. 
        The reporting Canadian entities for each NERC region are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>NPCC</strong> - NBSO, Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie, IESO</li>
          <li><strong>MRO</strong> - Manitoba Hydro, SaskPower </li>
          <li><strong>WECC</strong> - AESO, BCTC</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, the requirement of entities in Canada to report reliability information 
        to NERC constitutes comprehensive and consistent reporting across Canada.</p>

        <h2 id="s3">3. Assessment of Current Reporting and Gaps in the Provision of Reliability Performance Information</h2>
        <p>The main purpose of Recommendation&nbsp;10 is to establish an independent source of 
        reliability performance information and, accordingly, common definitions and information 
        collection standards should be established. Apart from that, Recommendation&nbsp;10 does 
        not provide specific direction on the performance information to be monitored, such 
        as specific measures or performance indicators, or what the criteria to establish 
        them should be. Based on the information reported by Canadian entities, a number of 
        considerations or questions arise that may help to assess these matters from the Canadian 
        standpoint.</p>
        <h3>How might this information be used? Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>There are a number of uses for compiling reliability performance information including 
        the fundamental monitoring of trends, which may point to the effectiveness of reliability 
        standards or the industry's and NERC's implementation of standards. This 
        information is also likely to be useful to regulators and policy makers.</p>
        <h3>What are the criteria for selecting reliability information?</h3>
        <p>It is necessary that data and other information be accessible, transparent, verifiable
        and consistent over time, enabling analysis of trends and possibly inter-regional
        comparisons. Consistency requires that data be reported on a regular basis and that
        reporting be mandatory, or at least that the data will be made available with a high
        degree of assurance. It goes without saying that the data would need to be comprehensive
        in the sense of being complete and representative of industry (reliability) trends.</p>
        <h3>What information is currently being reported?</h3>
        <p>As indicated in section&nbsp;2, there is currently substantial information being reported by Canadian entities to the CEA, the provinces and NERC with respect to the reliability 
        of bulk power systems. Reporting by entities to NERC largely meets the above criteria 
        and has the advantage of comprehensive and standardized reporting for Canadian and 
        U.S. entities, which together influence the reliability of the interconnected Canadian 
        and U.S. bulk power systems.</p>
        <p>Currently, reporting on reliability standards and related reliability compliance 
        information is not mandatory for all Canadian entities unless and until their respective 
        provincial regulators adopt NERC standards. Reliability information requirements imposed 
        by the FERC on NERC in the U.S. are also not mandatory in Canada, unless adopted by 
        Canadian regulators. For the most part, going forward, it does not seem likely that 
        reporting by Canadian entities would be greatly affected, i.e., whether reporting 
        requirements are mandatory or not, given the historical cooperation under voluntary 
        standards, and the interest in maintaining good relationships in their respective 
        RROs with their U.S. counterparts.</p>
        <h3>What are the gaps between what is currently reported and what is needed?</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest gap is that currently there is little readily available information 
        that tracks trends in bulk power system reliability performance in Canada or, for 
        that matter, in the U.S. As indicated above, this is not because the information, 
        or data, is not reported, but because it is not readily displayed for public use.</p>
        <p>So far, reliability information compiled by NERC has mainly focused on compliance 
        with reliability standards; however, this is not necessarily the same as indicating 
        trends in reliability performance. Monitoring reliability performance directly -- 
        by the systematic development of standard indicators such as the frequency and duration 
        of transmission system interruptions, trends in reserve margins and incidences of 
        compliance violations, etc. -- may provide indications about the effectiveness of 
        NERC and the power industry in improving reliability and the effects of actions taken 
        when problems are identified. NERC's Information Reliability Dashboard and TADS 
        initiatives would appear to take significant steps in that direction. In this context, 
        monitoring compliance with reliability standards could well be a leading indicator 
        of reliability in that current failures to comply may lead to future reliability issues.</p>
        <h3>Independent Source of Reliability Information</h3>
        <p>Recommendation&nbsp;10 implies that the independent source of reliability information 
        would be a government agency, suggesting that the EIA could possibly carry out this 
        responsibility in the U.S. As indicated in section&nbsp;2, with some investment of time 
        and resources, it would be possible for Statistics Canada to perform this function 
        in Canada. However, it seems that much, if not all, of the data required for developing 
        reliability indicators is already being reported to NERC for standards compliance 
        and reporting. Therefore, there does not appear to be a need to establish another 
        information source in Canada. Whether additional information would be required depends 
        eventually on what might be regarded as appropriate performance measures.<sup>[21]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[21] A matter not addressed in this report is the
        relationship between grid reliability and investment. It is often indicated that
        trends in transmission investment in North America generally have not kept pace with
        the growth in electricity demand, which has led to stressing the transmission system
        and, in some cases, compromising electric reliability. If &quot;investment performance&quot; in transmission were identified as a need, it may be appropriate to approach Statistics
        Canada (which currently undertakes a survey of the capital expenditures of Canadian
        electric utilities and publishes annual data) to clarify what data are currently
        collected and whether any changes to its survey would be required.</p>
        <p>Having NERC as the source of reliability performance information also has the
        advantage of benefiting from broad stakeholder input including the industry, RROs,
        regulators, policy makers and the public. Any concern about whether NERC would be
        an independent source would appear to be addressed given the transparent nature
        in which NERC conducts its monitoring and compliance reporting. Finally, NERC has
        a process in place to ensure commonality in definitions and collection standards.
        This is an important consideration given the inter-regional (cross-border and inter-provincial) nature of electric reliability.</p>

        <h2 id="s4">4. Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Since the report on causes of the August&nbsp;2003 blackout was issued in April&nbsp;2004 substantial steps have been taken to improve the reliability of the North American 
        bulk power system, the major initiative being the formation and implementation of 
        mandatory electric reliability standards in&nbsp;2007. Establishing an independent source 
        of reliability performance information has not advanced as quickly. However, efforts 
        undertaken to date by NERC, which is recognized in the U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions 
        as the ERO, seem directed toward that end. From the NEB's perspective, the need 
        for another entity to provide an independent source of reliability information is 
        not justified at this time.</p>

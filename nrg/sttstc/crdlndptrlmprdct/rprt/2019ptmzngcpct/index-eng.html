<h2>A. The National Energy Board’s advice</h2>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s Minister of Natural Resources requested advice from  the National Energy Board (NEB or Board) on three key questions. The Board&rsquo;s advice  is summarized here, with details following in the remainder of the report.</p>
<p><strong>1. Is  the current monthly nomination process to access available capacity on oil  pipelines functioning appropriately, consistent with the &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; provisions  of the National Energy Board Act and  efficient utilization of pipeline infrastructure (for example, by auctioning  uncontracted export capacity to smaller producers)?</strong></p>
<p>The Board advises that pipelines transporting crude oil out of western Canada are currently  operating at their full capacity, after recent optimization efforts from  pipelines and their shippers. Any notable increase in pipeline throughput would  need to come from new capacity additions, rather than further optimization of  existing pipeline systems. Unexpected delays in almost all proposed major  pipeline projects in the last decade have resulted in oil production surpassing  pipeline capacity, creating an extended period of high levels of pipeline  apportionment.</p>
<p>In the current  circumstances, the existing monthly nomination procedures on the four major  crude oil export pipelines do not appear to affect the pipelines&rsquo; operational  efficiency. Additionally, the information gathered by the NEB in  preparing this advice does not raise compliance concerns with respect to  nomination and verification rules specified in tariffs on NEB-regulated  pipelines, which are in place to help satisfy common carriage requirements. However,  existing verification procedures across the industry as a whole allow shippers  to nominate more oil to pipelines than can be supplied. Integrated producers and  those shippers that own or have contracted crude oil storage and refinery capacity  have a greater ability to acquire pipeline capacity. These shippers made  certain investments in the past and, under current market conditions, these  investments provide more flexibility in accessing pipeline capacity.</p>
<p>During consultations, there was a lot of discussion on the  current method of allocation and whether, in effect, it complies with the  spirit of common carriage. Although it would involve facilities outside of the  jurisdiction of the NEB, improving the existing verification framework through  the whole supply chain may address these concerns. Any change to the way  shippers access pipeline capacity would have significant effects on markets and  stakeholders. Accordingly, consultation with stakeholders would be needed.</p>
<p>Changes to existing nomination or verification procedures  would reallocate pipeline space among shippers, but would not increase  utilization further. A more direct way to address pipeline access issues would be  additional pipeline capacity.</p>
<p><strong>2. Are  there any other impediments to the further optimization of pipeline capacity  that could be addressed by the National Energy Board, governments or pipeline  companies, in the short-term and long-term?</strong></p>
<p>The Board advises that there are several potential solutions  to further optimizing capacity, but most of them would require structural  changes to the market, significant investments, and a long time horizon. For  example, building partial upgraders could reduce the amount of diluent needed  to ship bitumen, freeing space in existing pipelines. Reversal of existing  pipelines currently importing diluent could increase the amount of oil exported  from western Canada. However, uncertainty regarding if and when incremental  pipeline capacity will come online has ripple effects across industry by  hampering investment decisions to develop alternatives to pipelines, including  addition of rail capacity.</p>
<p>Private investors may be reluctant to make major  investments in projects that may become uneconomic if new pipeline capacity is  added. However, in making investment decisions, governments may have different  motives than private investors, such as increasing market diversification,  employment, and government revenues.<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Board also advises that governments may have a role to  play in enhancing transparency of the market by collecting and publishing non-public  market data in a timely manner to create a more level playing field for all  market participants.</p>
<p><strong>3. Are  there short-term steps to further maximize rail capacity that could be  addressed by governments to alleviate the current situation?</strong></p>
<p>The Board advises that rail is not a perfect substitute for additional  pipeline capacity. Moving crude by rail is more expensive and becomes less  economic if price differentials narrow. It also typically involves a more  complex process than moving crude by pipeline. Additionally, arranging transportation  for crude by rail has a long lead time and impacts shipment of other goods. Uncertainty  about the timing and approval of additional pipeline capacity is hampering  private investment in rail capacity. There may be a role for governments to simplify  or coordinate the process for arranging rail transportation, especially for  smaller companies that may not be able to make long-term financial commitments.  However, any policy action has the potential to create unintended consequences  given the complexity of the system.</p>
<p>The Board thanks the Minister for this opportunity to  provide input on these important issues.</p>

<h2>B. Introduction</h2>
<p>On  30 November 2018, Canada&rsquo;s Minister of Natural Resources, the Honourable  Amarjeet Sohi, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2018/12/letter-from-canadas-minister-of-natural-resources-the-honourable-amarjeet-sohi-to-mr-c-peter-watson-chair-and-chief-executive-officer-of-the-nation.html">wrote</a> to the NEB to seek advice on options that may  exist to further optimize pipeline capacity out of western Canada.<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> This  was in response to the wide price differentials for Canadian crudes in the  latter part of 2018, and their impacts on Canada.</p>
<p>The  NEB released a report, <a href="/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/rprt/2018wstrncndncrd/index-eng.html">Western  Canadian Crude Oil Supply, Markets, and Pipeline Capacity</a><sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>, on  27&nbsp;December 2018.</p>
<p>In January 2019, NEB staff held thirty meetings with selected  pipeline companies, producers, shippers, associations, government agencies, and  other experts to seek input on the questions in the Minister&rsquo;s letter. The  Board thanks the following companies and organizations for meeting with Board  staff and providing input on the issues:</p>

<h2>C.	Markets</h2>
<p>The NEB released a report, <a href="/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/rprt/2018wstrncndncrd/index-eng.html">Western  Canadian Crude Oil Supply, Markets, and Pipeline Capacity</a>, on  27&nbsp;December 2018. That report provides market context for this advice to  the Minister. The NEB recommends reading that document together with the  additional market context presented here.</p>
	<p>
Global oil markets operate  competitively, however they are extremely complex with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>varying levels of transparency</li>
  <li>many different types of crude oil and refined products</li>
  <li>limitations on the types of crude oil that  refineries can accept</li>
  <li>multiple trading platforms, contracts, and timeframes</li>
  <li>numerous ways of transporting crude oils and  refined products, all of which can be constrained</li>
  <li>varying degrees of market regulation across  multiple jurisdictions</li>
  <li>numerous local and regional market dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>As discussed in the report issued  in December, western Canada produces far more oil than it can consume or store  locally. Therefore, oil must be exported. The United States Midwest and Gulf  Coast are some of the largest markets for Canadian oil and therefore these  markets determine the prices Canadian producers receive for their oil. This  makes Canadian producers &ldquo;price takers&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>Recent prices and market impacts</h3>
<p><strong>Western Canadian oil  prices have significantly recovered and price differentials with WTI narrowed  since last fall, though this is largely because of Alberta&rsquo;s production  curtailment.</strong></p>
<p>Canadian  crude prices have recovered since last fall when the most commonly quoted  Canadian oil benchmark, Western Canadian Select priced at Hardisty, Alberta (WCS),  traded at a record discount of more than US$50 per barrel relative to West  Texas Intermediate priced at Cushing, Oklahoma (WTI).<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> Price  differentials slightly narrowed in late November and early December, and further  narrowed when the Government of Alberta announced its production curtailment.  In mid-January, the WCS-WTI discount reached US$7.50 per barrel.<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup></p>
<p>January&rsquo;s differentials narrowed further than  many producers, marketers, and other industry experts had expected. While  supply has decreased due to mandated oil production curtailment, pipelines are  still full and early indications are that storage levels remain relatively high.<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup></p>
<p>Current  WCS-WTI differentials of approximately US$10 per barrel are below the cost to ship  crude by rail to major refining markets in the United States. Transporting  crude from Alberta to United States refineries by rail typically costs US$15-22  per barrel, and business decisions to ship by rail are made anticipating  differentials in this range. As a result, when differentials are quite narrow,  less oil tends to leave Alberta by rail. Shippers prefer to move their oil by  the least expensive mode of transport available, which is pipelines.</p>
<h3>Market data issues</h3>
<p><strong>Better public data regarding storage, refining, and pricing could help the crude oil market work more efficiently.</strong></p>
<p>For the transportation of oil to  be efficient, all parts of the supply chain must work together. Contractual  flows of oil are such that a barrel may be bought and sold a number of times. A  barrel of oil may be purchased by several marketers and other third parties  before reaching the refinery where it is consumed. Oil can be transferred by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A producer selling directly to a refinery</li>
  <li>An integrated producer supplying its own  refinery</li>
  <li>A producer selling to a marketer or other third  parties, who may sell it to other parties in a series of transactions ending at  a refinery </li>
</ul>
<p>An integrated producer may do all  of the above.</p>
	<div class="well well-sm col-md-4 pull-right">
	  <p><strong>Integrated producers </strong>produce oil and own refineries. Non-integrated producers sometimes enter long term contracts with refineries. This gives them options similar to those of integrated producers.</p>
  </div>
<p>Larger producers (including  integrated producers) may have marketing departments that find downstream  refiners to buy oil production. Producers may also sell directly to a marketer,  who then takes on the risk of finding another buyer, whether it is another  marketer or a refinery. Alternatively, some producers may pay a fee to have  marketing companies sell their production on their behalf. In particular,  smaller producers tend to use this option. When the price differential is wide,  producers are better off exporting their crude oil to markets where the price  is higher. If they cannot get access to these markets they earn less profit or  may even be forced to sell at a loss.</p>
<p>When markets have limited information, different market  participants may not be able to make informed decisions. Some public data are  available for some aspects of the oil supply chain in western Canada, though  transparency could be improved. For other aspects, commercial datasets are  available at a cost and often have significant restrictions on publication.</p>
<p>Additional information could be made available to the public  through frequent and timely publishing of transparent data such as, but not  limited to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>daily benchmark oil prices in Canada and the  United States, including differentials</li>
  <li>weekly oil storage capacity and inventories</li>
  <li>weekly or monthly crude by rail capacity,  loading and shipments</li>
  <li>monthly oil imports and exports</li>
  <li>pipeline nominations and apportionment </li>
  </ul>
<p>Better  refinery data – such as inputs of crude oil and outputs by product – could also  be useful, though the data would need to be treated carefully given the  regional and increasingly concentrated nature of the sector.<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> Gathering and publishing more refinery information could put  commercial business positions at risk, though data could be aggregated to help  mitigate this (e.g., by region).</p>
<p>Additional data could help market participants  in a variety of ways. For example, if small producers knew storage was almost  completely full or that refineries were shut down, then they could anticipate  not being able to sell or store their product, and might decide to reduce  production. Data regarding refinery crude runs and refinery outages would also  be beneficial for most market participants for planning purposes. More detailed  apportionment data would help producers better understand the volume of oil  being &ldquo;pushed back&rdquo;<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> to them by apportioned shippers.</p>
<p>Providing more public data on oil markets could be a near-term  improvement. Most market participants do not have any incentive to provide data  to the public, but greater information makes markets work more efficiently. Therefore,  governments may choose to step in although making data freely available to the public  may negatively affect existing commercial-data providers. Provinces regulate  their energy infrastructure and could require reporting for various levels of  storage, from field level to hub level. Provinces could also supply an  aggregate of the energy-price data they use for royalty calculations. </p>
<p>Canadian and United States oil markets are integrated with  one another, meaning that publishing Canadian datasets similar to United States  datasets may also be beneficial. For example, the Energy Information Administration  of the United States publishes daily oil prices as well as weekly storage and  refinery input and output data, all of which are widely used by industry,  governments, and the public. The Government of Canada has shown an interest in  providing more energy information to Canadians. Statistics Canada is also  authorized to collect a wide variety of information. Thus, the Government of  Canada may also be well positioned to collect and publish this information.</p><div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>

<h2>D.	Pipeline capacity </h2>
<p><strong>Existing export pipelines are fully utilized. Any significant increase in throughput would need to come from new capacity additions rather than optimization of existing pipeline systems.</strong></p>
<h3>Capacity and utilization</h3>
<p>The average utilization<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>rate on the country&rsquo;s major export pipelines - <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/pplnprtl/pplnprfls/crdl/nbrdgmnln-eng.html">Enbridge  Mainline</a>, <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/pplnprtl/pplnprfls/crdl/kstn-eng.html">Keystone</a>,  and <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/pplnprtl/pplnprfls/crdl/trnsmntn-eng.html">Trans  Mountain</a> - was 98% in the last quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>Several pipeline projects out of western Canada have been  proposed in the last decade, but many projects have been cancelled or delayed.  The table below lists oil pipelines out of western Canada that were proposed,  their proposed capacity increase in thousand barrels per day (b/d), the year  the project proponents initially expected the pipeline to go into service, and  the current status of each proposal.</p>

	<p>Oil production in western Canada has steadily increased  since the early 1980s. Historically, pipeline capacity has grown along with  production. Capacity is added in large increments as new pipelines or major  expansions occur, so the market would move from having a small amount of excess  pipeline capacity to a larger amount.</p>
	<p>Producers, particularly those with a focus on oil sands, invested  with a long-term view and with an expectation that sufficient pipeline capacity  would be available. Oil production has now outgrown pipeline capacity, causing  apportionment that market participants expect to last until new pipeline  capacity is put into service. Lack of sufficient pipeline capacity has  made it difficult to ship oil out of western Canada, and prices have plunged,  substantially reducing revenues for some producers and shippers and reducing government  royalties and other revenues.</p>
	<p>Apportionment sometimes happens when there are temporary  market disruptions, or constraints imposed by pipeline maintenance or operating  conditions. Apportionment may also result from many producers or shippers all trying  to reach the highest priced market. In the past, even if shippers could not  reach a preferred market, they could still get capacity on other pipelines to  move oil out of western Canada. More recently, however, shippers are facing  excess oil supply in western Canada relative to local demand, pipeline  capacity, rail capacity, and available storage and have nowhere to move their  oil.</p>
	<h3>Optimization</h3>
	<p><strong>Some operational issues have affected pipeline utilization in the past. These do not appear to be issues now. </strong></p>
		<div class="well well-sm col-md-4 pull-right"><p><strong>Operational complexity</strong></p>
   <p>Due to operational complexity, it is not possible for any pipeline to operate at 100% of capacity on a sustained basis. Some pipeline systems, such as the Enbridge Mainline, are inherently more difficult to operate at full capacity due to their size and the complexities of managing flows across multiple lines.</p>
  </div>
	<p>In recent years, pipeline companies have incrementally increased capacity and throughputs on their pipeline systems. For example, with the cooperation of its shippers, Enbridge Mainline improved its scheduling. This improvement was due to the introduction of a supplemental policy to fill under-utilized pipeline space. It increased the amount of usable capacity on the pipeline through quality pooling (where similar types of crude are grouped into common pools), making pipelines more flexible in transporting different qualities of crude oil. Some pipelines also increased total capacity through small investments in new facilities. While further operational improvements may be possible, they are unlikely to result in material pipeline capacity increases out of western Canada.</p>
	<h4>Batching</h4>
	<p>Oil pipelines typically ship products in batches, because different commodities  must be kept separate from one another to minimize contamination. For example,  the Enbridge Mainline ships dozens of commodities, including some refined  petroleum products. Shipping batches of various commodities increases the  complexity of scheduling receipts and deliveries compared to moving a single commodity. However,  systems have mitigated some inefficiencies by optimizing quality pooling rules,  as recently done by Enbridge and its shippers. It is possible that pipelines  could further optimize quality pooling rules, but shippers might not agree as  they value their commodities differently. </p>
    <h4>Change requests</h4>
		<div class="well well-sm col-md-6 pull-right"><p><strong>Oil storage</strong></p>
   <p>Oil physically flows from producers to refiners in a variety of ways, and can be stored when required. Storage facilities can be found near producing sites upstream, linked to feeder and large export pipelines, or located downstream at refineries. Storage helps pipeline companies balance short-term supply and demand fluctuations on the pipeline network. Additionally, storage can maximize value for the crude by delaying delivery until buyers are ready for it or prices increase.</p>
  </div>
    <p>Some pipelines experience a large number of in-month change requests for shipper nominations. A change request could be, for example, a change to the shipping destination. Pipeline operators indicated that these requests do not typically impact throughputs. For instance, if the pipeline is connected to a large inventory of crude oil in storage, it is less likely to miss opportunities to ship batches. Therefore, storage can increase the operational efficiency of a pipeline by reducing the risk of lower throughput. Pipelines may also decline change requests that will impact network operations. While these change requests have been problematic in the past, pipeline companies have largely resolved these issues.

<div class="clearfix"></div>
    <h2>E.	Allocating pipeline capacity</h2>
    <p><strong>Existing pipeline takeaway capacity is being fully and efficiently utilized from an operational perspective.</strong></p>
    <p>Many different shippers are competing for access to the  limited available pipeline space. These shippers include: refineries in the United  States seeking to ensure that they will have reliable supplies for their  operations; producers looking to sell their production at attractive prices in  export markets; as well as marketers and other companies that may buy oil from  any number of parties to move it to markets outside western Canada. While  overall capacity is being fully utilized, some market participants have raised  concerns regarding how pipeline capacity is currently allocated among shippers.</p>
    <h3>Procedures for allocating pipeline capacity</h3>
    <p>Pipeline tariffs specify the procedures by which shippers are to submit nominations for transportation service, including the form and timing of nominations. The tariffs also set out the rights and authorities of pipeline companies to verify nominations. The NEB regulates and determines compliance with tariffs for pipelines under its jurisdiction, which include the major export pipelines from western Canada. Pipeline companies and shippers are required to follow the rules and regulations of transportation service as set out in the tariffs.</p>
    <h4>Nomination procedures</h4>
    <p><strong>Access to pipeline capacity is obtained by submitting nominations to move crude oil on a pipeline. </strong></p>
    <p>A shipper must submit nominations each month to each  pipeline or facility that its oil flows through. This includes gathering lines,  feeder lines, storage terminals, and large export pipelines. In its nomination,  the shipper will specify the volume and type of crude oil that it intends to  ship the next month, and the receipt and delivery points. Shippers must submit  nominations for both committed (or contracted) transportation service, if  available, as well as uncommitted transportation service. Nominations on each  pipeline and facility are typically due on the same dates and times.</p>
			<div class="well well-sm col-md-6 pull-right"><p><strong>Apportionment </strong>is the percentage by which  each shipper&rsquo;s nominated volume is reduced to meet the pipeline&rsquo;s uncommitted  capacity. Generally, apportionment is applied equally across all shippers  seeking to use that capacity. For example, if shipper A nominates 100&nbsp;barrels  and shipper B nominates 1000 barrels, then, under 10% apportionment, shipper A  will be able to ship 90 barrels, and shipper&nbsp;B will be able to ship  900&nbsp;barrels.</p>
</div>
    <p>Based  on operating conditions, each pipeline operator determines the available  capacity of its pipeline for the month. Pipelines first allocate capacity to  committed shippers based on the committed shippers&rsquo; verified nominations<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> (up to their committed capacities). Any remaining capacity is treated as uncommitted capacity. If remaining nominations exceed remaining capacity, there will be apportionment on the pipeline. Under apportionment, uncommitted capacity is typically allocated on a pro rata basis, whereby each shipper is allocated a proportional share of pipeline capacity based on its verified nominations.</p>
    <p>After the pipeline operator builds its shipping schedule using the accepted nominations, shippers may submit change requests to revise various aspects of the accepted nominations, as discussed in Section D.</p>
    <h4>Verification procedures</h4>
    <p><strong>Verification is performed to ensure that a shipper has the capability to satisfy its nominations.</strong></p>
    <p>To ensure that a shipper has not nominated volumes that it  cannot deliver to the system, the pipeline may require certification that the  shipper has available supply sufficient to fulfill its nominated volume. The  pipeline may also require certification that the destination facility is  capable of accepting the shipper&rsquo;s nominated volume.</p>
    <p>Verification is not limited to NEB-regulated pipelines and  may occur at any facility that receives nominations from shippers. For example,  feeder pipelines, storage terminals, and downstream connecting pipelines and  other facilities may all verify the nominations they receive. As part of the  verification process, a facility may request verifications from both upstream  and downstream connected facilities.</p>
    <p>The NEB does not mandate the verification of shipper  nominations, and it has generally allowed pipeline companies to develop and  administer their own verification procedures. Accordingly, NEB-regulated  pipelines conduct the following types of verification:</p>
    <ul class="lst-spcd">
      <li>Enbridge uses three types of verification on the  Enbridge Mainline. First, supply is verified by requiring each shipper to  submit a certificate, executed by an officer of the shipper company, confirming  that the shipper has the capability and intent to tender each crude type and  volume, and that the nomination has not been inflated to factor in  apportionment. Second, volumes must be verified by the connecting upstream  facility. Third, each downstream destination facility must submit monthly  verification affidavits, attesting that it is capable of receiving, and intends  to receive, the crude oil volumes nominated to it. </li>
      <li>Express Pipeline verification  procedures generally follow those used on the Enbridge Mainline, with the  exception of the shipper certificate and destination verification. The majority  of throughputs on Express Pipeline flow through the interconnected Platte Pipeline  in the United States. Platte allocates its capacity to shippers before Express conducts  its own allocation procedures. Pursuant to the delivery verification procedures  in the Express Pipeline tariff, the allocations on the Platte Pipeline limit  the nominations that are accepted for each shipper on the Express Pipeline.</li>
      <li>Trans Mountain uses different types of  verification, depending on the circumstances. For each shipper&rsquo;s nomination,  Trans Mountain requires written third-party verification from the interconnected  upstream facility that the shipper has the capability to tender product to  satisfy its nominated volume. Trans Mountain also requires written third-party  verification from the downstream delivery destination that the shipper has the  capability to remove its nominated volume from the pipeline. If a shipper  cannot provide upstream verification or destination verification from  unaffiliated third parties, Trans Mountain requires the shipper to provide a certificate  executed by an officer that addresses both supply and destination verification.<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup></li>
      <li>Keystone seeks verification (in the form of  upstream and downstream verification) of a shipper&rsquo;s nomination only when Keystone  deems that it has reasonable grounds to do so. These verifications may occur if  a shipper has failed to use the pipeline capacity that it was allocated in the  previous month or failed to provide Keystone with sufficient notice regarding  cancelled batches. In effect, this allows a shipper on Keystone to nominate up  to the entire pipeline capacity, subject to Keystone determining that the  shipper has proper credit in place to pay the transportation tolls for the resulting  allocated volume.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Current issues in allocating pipeline capacity</h3>
    <p>The information gathered by NEB staff in preparing this  report raises no concerns relating to shippers&rsquo; compliance with the nomination  and verification procedures that may be set out in NEB-regulated pipeline  tariffs. However, several industry participants raised concerns regarding how  pipeline capacity is allocated among shippers. In general, these concerns  revolved around the effectiveness of verification procedures throughout the  supply chain and the potential for shipper over-nominations.</p>
    <h4>Evidence of over-nominations</h4>
    <p><strong>There is evidence of over-nominations on the four major export pipelines.</strong></p>
    <p>In the current environment of constrained pipeline capacity,  some shippers nominate more barrels of oil than they intend to ship. While  shippers are complying with the procedures that are specified in NEB-regulated  tariffs, over-nominations have occurred on the four major pipelines that export  oil out of western Canada.</p>
    <p>To illustrate this, in December 2018, more than 13  million b/d of oil were nominated for shipment on pipelines exporting oil from  western Canada. However, the total amount of oil supply available for export<sup id="fn12-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup> in that month was approximately 5.4 million b/d.
      
    </p>
    <h4>Causes of over-nominations</h4>
    <p><strong>Integrated and transparent oversight of nomination and verification procedures are lacking across pipelines and other facilities.</strong></p>
    <p>By over-nominating, shippers increase the likelihood that,  after apportionment, they receive the amount of pipeline capacity they desire.  Over-nominations may also provide these shippers with excess capacity, and an  opportunity to fill this capacity with lower-priced crude that is stranded in  the local market.</p>
    <p>Verification can serve to limit over-nominations. With effective  verification, the total nominations to all export pipelines should not exceed reasonable  forecasts for production and what could reasonably be removed from storage in a  given month.</p>
    <p>However, existing verification procedures do not appear to  be limiting over-nominations in this manner. This is largely due to the fact  that while the crude oil supply chain is integrated from an operational perspective  (i.e., it facilitates the flow of crude oil from production site to end  destination), the oversight of nominations and verifications is not integrated  across all facilities in the supply chain. </p>
    <p>Currently, verification is not  mandated by regulators or governments and is at the discretion of the facility  operator. For example, during its consultations with industry participants, the  NEB heard that one major export pipeline and many upstream feeder pipelines and  terminals do not always verify shipper nominations. Additionally, there is no  requirement for facilities to follow the same or similar verification  procedures across industry. The Crude Oil Logistics Committee has created  verification guidelines for all facilities upstream of major export pipelines; however,  the effectiveness of the guidelines has been limited thus far by voluntary  participation and the lack of an enforcement authority.</p>
	<div class="well well-sm col-md-6 pull-right">
	  <p><strong>The Crude Oil Logistics Committee </strong>(COLC) is  made up of over 90 organizations, including producers, shippers, pipelines,  terminals, industry associations, and government regulators and departments. In  1996, the COLC developed an industry-wide standard for supply forecasting and  nomination procedures. The procedures cover all parties upstream of the major pipelines  or export pipelines, including gathering pipelines, feeder pipelines, shippers,  and terminal operators. </p>
	  <p>The goal of  the procedures is to ensure there is a reasonable level of accuracy in supply  forecasting, each system is balanced (receipts and dispositions), transfers  from one system to another match, and to ensure there is no overlap or gap in  volume forecast data from system to system. </p>
	  <p>Feeder  pipelines ultimately provide large export pipelines with verified forecasts of  deliveries which are the result of the supply forecasting and disposition data. </p>
    </div>
    <p>Moreover, there is no rigorous verification system that  would help ensure that each barrel of crude oil produced is ultimately  nominated to just one destination. The market and supply chains are complex,  and each barrel of crude oil may have been purchased and sold by several  different companies and traveled through several different facilities before it  reaches its ultimate destination. Accordingly, NEB-regulated pipelines rely on  upstream facilities to provide verification data to be used in verifying  shippers&rsquo; nominations to the pipeline.</p>
    <p>Some upstream facilities do not provide the data that would  allow verification, sometimes due to confidentiality agreements between  facility operators and users. Consequently, the lack of coordination and flow  of data between facilities creates challenges for major export pipelines in  verifying nominations.</p>
    <p>Without nomination and verification data, facility operators  may be able to assess whether shippers have the physical capability to satisfy their nominations. However, they may  face significant challenges in determining whether a shipper has the intent to transport the barrels that  they have nominated. For example, a company that owns or contracts storage may  nominate to a pipeline the full amount of oil that it has in storage, even if  it does not intend to move this oil and instead hopes to purchase lower-cost  supply just prior to the shipping date. The pipeline may determine that the  shipper&rsquo;s storage facility has the capability to satisfy the shipper&rsquo;s  nominated volume, but the pipeline may not be able to verify that the shipper  does not have the intent to ship the volumes nominated from its storage  facility.</p>
    <h4>Impacts of over-nominations</h4>
    <p><strong>Under current verification procedures, integrated producers and shippers who own or have contracted storage and refining capacity have greater ability to acquire pipeline capacity. Over nominations may result in producers selling their crude oil at reduced prices.</strong></p>
    <p>Over-nominations have resulted in high levels of  apportionment, and have had several impacts on participants in the Canadian oil  industry.</p>
    <p>First, over-nominations have contributed to some western  Canadian producers selling their crude oil at depressed prices. When shippers  over-nominate to pipelines, apportionment is exacerbated. Contracts in place  between producers and shippers are structured such that a shipper is able to  &ldquo;push back&rdquo; apportioned barrels to the producer. As apportionment levels  increase, more barrels can be pushed back to producers. This sudden, artificial  increase to the oil supply in the local market can cause western Canadian crude  prices to become severely depressed, particularly when producers lack access to  adequate storage. Consequently, producers receive materially lower prices for  their crude oil.</p>
    <p>Shippers that over-nominate and have remaining allocated  pipeline capacity can then buy oil at substantially reduced prices in this  market. The potential gains from buying barrels at the artificially low prices  encourages companies to acquire as much pipeline capacity as possible, further  increasing over-nominations. </p>
    <p>Second, over-nominations can affect the  allocation of capacity across shippers. As noted above, verifications are, in  effect, limited to assessing shippers&rsquo; physical capabilities. Some participants  in the NEB&rsquo;s consultations were of the view that existing nomination and  verification procedures tend to favour integrated producers and companies that  own or have contracted capacity with storage and refining assets in Canada and  the United States. By having access to large facilities upstream and downstream  of export pipelines, these companies are better able to demonstrate that they  have the physical capability to supply considerable volumes to, and remove  considerable volumes from, pipelines. In the absence of rigorous verification,  a shipper can leverage its investments in infrastructure to over-nominate up to  its physical capabilities. Several  market participants suggested that this increased ability to over-nominate may  be unfair and may prevent pipelines from complying with common carrier  requirements.<sup id="fn13-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup></p>
    <p>On the other hand, prevailing market conditions have  different impacts on upstream producers and downstream refiners. While shippers  that own refining and storage capacity currently have a greater ability to  acquire pipeline capacity in current circumstances, these companies have faced high  supply costs in other market conditions, which benefited producers.</p>
    <p>During the NEB&rsquo;s consultations, some market participants  explained that there is no discrimination in the current nomination and  verification practices, as shippers have been free to develop business  strategies and make investment decisions in order to manage their risks and  exposures. According to these industry participants, all shippers had an  opportunity to prepare for the current apportionment environment by making  investments that would help them acquire pipeline space, or by entering  contracts with owners of storage and refineries. Small producers may lack the  financial resources to make large investments or enter into long-term  commitments. </p>
    <h3>Potential solutions to over-nominations</h3>
    <p>Under the existing nomination and verification procedures,  the utilization of pipeline capacity is operationally efficient. There is broad  agreement among industry participants that the four major export pipelines are  full. Changes to the nomination or verification procedures would reallocate  pipeline space among shippers, but would not increase utilization further. Changes  could, however, reduce the number of apportioned barrels that are ultimately  &ldquo;pushed back&rdquo; to producers.</p>
	<p>
      The previous section of this report outlines potential issues  with the existing verification procedures, including the lack of integrated  oversight and transparency across different facilities in the crude oil supply  chain. These issues relate not only to NEB-regulated pipelines, but also  facilities, companies, and behaviours that extend beyond the NEB&rsquo;s  jurisdiction. For this reason, any improvements to existing verification  procedures must be developed and coordinated across jurisdictions. They cannot  be addressed by the NEB alone.</p>
    <h4>Verification-based solutions</h4>
    <p><strong>Verification procedures are a complex, interjurisdictional issue. </strong></p>
    <p>There is scope to improve existing verification procedures. Such  improvements could take a variety of different forms, ranging from minor  adjustments to designing and establishing a new and integrated verification  framework. This extends beyond the NEB&rsquo;s oversight of federally-regulated  pipelines.</p>
    <p>As nomination verification is complex and cross-jurisdictional, there  is significant risk of unintended consequences in making material changes to  existing verification procedures without broad consultation with industry,  governments, and regulatory bodies. Therefore, any material changes to the  existing verification procedures are likely best developed in collaboration  with industry participants and relevant governments or regulatory bodies. </p>
    <p>Accordingly, if the Minister were to decide changes to existing  verification procedures should be explored, an effective first step may be to  have an interjurisdictional technical conference to discuss these changes.  Participants in the technical conference should include: producers; marketers;  operators of feeder pipelines, terminals, and large export pipelines; refiners;  the COLC; other industry associations; relevant provincial governments and provincial  regulators; Natural Resources Canada; and the NEB.</p>
    <p>Potential topics for discussion at a technical  conference could include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The goals and objectives of verification procedures. </li>
      <li>The need for, and design of, uniform  verification rules that could be applied across all or certain key facilities  in the crude oil supply chain.</li>
      <li>The need to require all facilities to verify  nominations on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>How to enforce compliance with verification  rules.</li>
      <li>How to improve coordination and the flow of data  between facilities that perform verifications.</li>
      <li>The identification and mitigation of any  advantages or disadvantages inherent in the existing verification procedures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During its consultations, NEB staff heard a number of different  high-level suggestions from industry participants regarding improvements to  verification procedures. The viability of these suggestions could be discussed  at a technical conference. For example, the COLC has developed a proposal for  enhanced verification guidelines that could be applied at all facilities  upstream of export pipelines. Many industry participants indicated that the  implementation of these guidelines would represent a significant improvement to  existing verification procedures. This improvement would be based on the use of  the guidelines being mandated for all facilities and compliance with the system  being enforced. A technical conference could be used to discuss how to achieve  universal use of the guidelines and effective oversight and enforcement.</p>
    <p>Any solution should recognize that different industry participants will  have opposing views on verification procedures throughout the supply chain. Nomination  and verification procedures should not hinder shippers who currently have the  flexibility to engage in trading activities to secure supplies, while at the  same time ensuring that no company has a disproportionate advantage or  disadvantage in acquiring pipeline capacity under the procedures. Any changes  to nomination or verification procedures that involve revisions to  NEB-regulated pipelines&rsquo; tariffs would require adjudication by the NEB.</p>
    <h4>Allocation-based solutions</h4>
    <p><strong>Rather than using nomination and verification procedures, pipeline capacity could instead be allocated using alternative allocation methodologies, which are generally not favoured by industry. </strong></p>
    <p>The preceding section of this report  discusses potential improvements to the industry&rsquo;s verification procedures. In  spite of the issues identified earlier in the report, Board staff heard that there  is continued support among industry participants for the current pro rata  apportionment system. </p>
    <p>During its consultations with industry participants, NEB  staff discussed different methodologies for allocating uncommitted pipeline  capacity to shippers, including auctions. These alternative methodologies are  generally not favoured. Alternative methodologies may offer some theoretical  benefits, but in implementation carry many practical economic and technical  risks. For example, an auction may better allocate uncommitted capacity to  those shippers who value it most. However, an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; pipeline  capacity allocation methodology, such as an auction system, would increase  uncertainty for shippers and refiners. This may disrupt contractual  relationships between producers, marketers, and downstream buyers, and could  also have impacts on the efficient operation of downstream facilities and  markets.</p>
    <p>Implementing alternative allocation methodologies would  likely require changes to each NEB-regulated pipeline&rsquo;s transportation tariffs.  The NEB would need to adjudicate such changes.</p>

    <h2>F.	Crude by rail</h2>
    <h3>Markets</h3>
    <p><strong>Although crude oil exports by rail increased throughout 2018, shipping crude by pipeline is generally preferred. </strong></p>
    <p>Exports reached  354 thousand b/d in December 2018. However, some producers have publicly  announced a significant reduction in the volume of crude moved by rail in  January.</p>
    <p>Current rail  infrastructure in Canada is operating at or near capacity, moving many  commodities, of which crude oil is only a small fraction. The capacity to ship  crude oil by rail is a function of many factors, including availability of tank  cars, locomotives, crews, tracks, and the demand on the system to ship other  goods.</p>
Shipping crude oil by rail to major markets in  the United States generally costs US$15-22 per barrel, compared to US$5-10 per  barrel by pipeline. As such, shipping by pipeline is generally preferred.  Significant volumes of crude oil generally only move by rail when there is  insufficient pipeline capacity available and the WCS-WTI price differential is  wide enough to justify the higher rail cost. Due to its dependence on prices,  the demand for shipping crude by rail is unpredictable.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows exports of crude oil by rail in thousand barrels per day from January 2017 until December 2018. Exports by rail averaged 120 Mb/d in January 2017 and reached a high of 354 Mb/d in December 2018.</p>
</details>
<h3>Complexities of crude by rail</h3><p><strong>Shipping crude by rail requires coordination between multiple parties. </strong></p>
	<div class="well well-sm col-md-6 pull-right"><p><strong>Unit trains versus manifest trains</strong></p>
	  <p>Unit trains move only one product directly between two  locations. They also benefit from reduced turn-around times and are the most  efficient way to move crude by rail. This makes them more economic at a  narrower differential than manifest trains, which carry crude oil on individual  cars, along with other cars transporting different cargoes. This adds time as  the trains are required to stop at multiple destinations for loading and  unloading. Though manifest trains are not as efficient as unit trains and cost  more, they may be a more viable option for smaller or infrequent shipments.</p>
</div>

<p>The preferred  method of transporting crude by rail is via the use of unit trains. A single  unit train consists of approximately three to four locomotives moving 80 to 100  tank cars from one loading facility to a single destination. In order to ship  crude oil by rail, a company must have the ability to transport crude into a rail  loading facility, the rail cars to carry the crude, arrangements with a rail  carrier who owns the tracks, and an agreement with a downstream refinery or  terminal with the necessary rail unloading infrastructure.</p>
<p>Bringing a new  unit train operation into service can take a rail carrier between 12 and 24  months. Recruiting and training crews along the proposed route, acquiring  locomotives, and in some cases building additional sidings along the track to  accommodate the increased rail traffic may all be required. There are long wait  times for equipment and unpredictable demand for crude by rail service. Additionally,  there is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of new pipeline  infrastructure. As a result, investing in moving more crude by rail cmes with  considerable financial risk.</p>
<h3>Potential solutions</h3>
<p><strong>Significant increases in crude by rail would only be possible in the medium to long term. </strong></p>
<p>In Canada,  rail carriers&rsquo; tracks tend to operate at capacity, particularly during grain  harvest season. Therefore, a long-term investment in building new tracks would  be necessary in order to significantly increase year-round crude by rail capacity.  This would be a multi-year construction process, involving at least one to two  years of permitting and regulatory processes. Furthermore, limited land may be available,  especially in larger urban centres.</p>
<p>Investment in  new rail cars, locomotives, or crews, by industry or governments, could take up  to 1-2 years to come into service due to the lead times required to build  equipment and recruit crews. </p>
<p>It is  important to note that regardless of whether the capacity to ship crude by rail  were increased, the price differential will be the primary factor that  determines how much crude actually moves by rail. The unpredictability of  Canadian crude differentials means that any investments in crude by rail  infrastructure may come with considerable risk for Canadian producers as they  are price takers. However, governments may have different priorities than  private investors, such as increasing market diversification, employment, and  government revenues.</p>

<h2>G.	Medium- to long-term solutions</h2>
<p><strong>Predictable timelines and clear policies help market participants make  decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Investment  decisions are harder to make when policies are unclear, or outcomes and  timelines for processes and projects relating to oil transportation  infrastructure are unknown. This includes decisions on capital investment for  new production, and decisions on how oil is marketed and transported. Greater certainty  regarding proposed new pipeline capacity would help market participants predict  when and how much pipeline capacity would come on stream, which would in turn  allow them to arrange for rail contracts in the interim. </p>
<p>Providing  more clarity on the expected completion and commissioning dates of proposed pipeline  systems can be a near-term objective. However, some clarity may be difficult to  provide, especially for systems which are subject to complex and multi-faceted regulatory  processes.</p>
<p>In the absence of new pipeline capacity, some large infrastructure  changes or additions could be considered. Several medium- to long-term options  are described in this section. However, these changes or additions would be  expensive and time consuming, would require regulatory approvals, and may  become uneconomic if and when new pipeline capacity comes online.</p>
<p><strong>Better market data could help market participants and  policy makers make decisions in the near term about investments and actions in  the medium to long term.</strong></p>
<p>Decisions about investments and policy are based on  information available at that time. Better, public market data could help  market participants and policy makers make more-informed decisions. This  includes decisions made in the near term about additional capacity that could  come online in the medium to long term. Better market data could also help level  the playing field between smaller market participants and larger market  participants in making decisions about the medium to long term. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier in the report, additional public data  would be beneficial. In addition to this, it may be beneficial to collect and  share data with limited groups at relevant times even if that data may not be  made available to the public. For example, more confidential data could be  shared with regulators and other government agencies.</p>
<h3>Shipping undiluted bitumen</h3>
<p><strong>By shipping undiluted  bitumen in rail cars, the volume of bitumen exported by rail can be increased. </strong></p>
<p>If undiluted bitumen could be shipped by rail, the volume of bitumen that could be exported would increase by anywhere from 43% to 100%, depending on how much it would otherwise need to be diluted.<sup id="fn14-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> Undiluted bitumen  is not classified as a dangerous good in the railway system. As a result, shippers  can use a greater variety of rail cars. </p>
<p>However, rail  loading facilities would need to be constructed near bitumen production sites  or diluent recovery units would need  to be built to remove diluent in diluted bitumen that was already shipped to  Edmonton or Hardisty by pipeline. Downstream, refineries would need to build facilities to receive  undiluted bitumen. This may include building heating units to remove the  bitumen from the rail cars, as well as units to re‑dilute/blend the bitumen  before processing it in the refinery. Some proposals for shipping raw bitumen  involve creating bitumen pellets, bitumen balls, or &ldquo;bitumen in a bag&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Overall, the investment needed would be significant,  and the required infrastructure may take years to build. </p>
<h3>Additional upgrading to reduce diluent volume</h3>
<p><strong>More upgrading of bitumen to a higher quality product could reduce the volume of diluent needed and open up space on existing pipelines. </strong></p>
<p>Canada exported about 2 million b/d of diluted bitumen in 2018. Fully upgrading more raw bitumen into synthetic crude oil (SCO, a high-quality light oil equivalent)<sup id="fn15-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>15</a></sup>, or partially upgrading more raw bitumen into heavy or medium sour oil, would reduce the need for diluent and free up space in existing pipelines.</p>
<p>Full  and partial upgraders are significant investments and require years to permit  and build. Currently, none of the <a href="https://albertainnovates.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitumen-Partial-Upgrading-2018-Whitepaper-2433-Jacobs-Consultancy-rev7.pdf" rel="external">proposed  partial-upgrading technologies</a> are operating commercially. One  proponent indicates they may have a commercial, partial-upgrading pilot running  by the end of 2022, costing around $1 billion and upgrading 45 thousand b/d of  bitumen. The Government of Alberta recently awarded grants and loans to a  proposed 77.5 thousand b/d partial upgrading project near Edmonton.<sup id="fn16-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup></p>
<p>One advantage partial upgraders  have over full upgraders is that partial upgraders would produce heavy to  medium sour oils, which are sought after by refineries in the United States  currently processing Canadian heavy oil. Additional SCO, on the other hand,  would compete against growing light oil production in the United States. Upgrading,  whether full or partial, is likely to be a better option than fully refining  additional oil in Alberta, where refined petroleum markets are already  adequately supplied.</p>
<p>If more pipeline space is eventually available, partial upgraders could  sit idle if they are more expensive to operate than simply diluting bitumen. Governments  may choose to take on this kind of investment risk to achieve policy objectives.</p>
<h3>Reversing diluent-import pipelines to export crude oil</h3>
<p><strong>Canada currently imports a significant amount of diluent through two pipelines. If these were reversed, Canada could export more crude oil. </strong></p>
<p>Importantly, the hydrocarbons  used to dilute bitumen must be acquired. Western Canada produces <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/snpsht/2019/02-01prdctncndnstpntns-eng.html">a  significant amount of condensate and pentanes plus</a>, which are used  as diluent. However, western Canada does not produce enough to meet demand and currently  215 thousand  b/d of diluent is imported on the Enbridge&rsquo;s Southern Lights and Kinder  Morgan&rsquo;s Cochin pipelines.</p>
<p>If the companies owning one or both of  these pipelines wanted to reverse them, these pipelines could be used to export  crude oil from western Canada to Illinois, a market which already consumes a  significant amount of Canadian crude oil. The reversal would take over a year  of work, not including the time required for regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>However, this would impact western  Canada&rsquo;s diluent market, significantly raising prices and operating costs for  oil sands producers. Domestic production of condensate and pentanes plus grew  over 100 thousand b/d per year since 2017 because of development of liquids-rich  natural gas. From this perspective, one year of growth is enough to replace  most of Southern Lights&rsquo; throughput and two years of production growth would be  enough to replace most diluent imported on both pipelines. The graph shows projected  supply of condensate and pentanes plus in western Canada from <a href="/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2018/index-eng.html">Canada&rsquo;s  Energy Future 2018: Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2040</a>.  However, natural gas production partly depends on natural gas prices and the  extra diluent supply may not materialize as projected.</p>

<summary>Description</summary>
<p>This graph shows western Canadian condensate and pentanes plus production from 2010 to 2040. Total production was 397 thousand barrels per day in 2018. This increases to 573 thousand barrels per day in 2025, and 876 thousand barrels per day in 2040.</p>

<p>There are also  several Canadian and U.S. regulatory approvals that would be required to reverse  a pipeline with associated time requirements and policy impacts.</p>
<h2>H.	Considerations</h2>
<p><strong>When markets or rules  change, market participants need to adjust accordingly, sometimes in  unpredicted ways.</strong></p>
<p>This report identifies a number of concerns raised by  participants in the western Canadian crude oil market, along with possible  paths forward to address these concerns. While considering the implications of  any government action, it is important to note that not all outcomes can be  predicted. Market participants build business models and make investment  decisions based on expected market conditions (such as supply, demand, and  infrastructure) and market rules (such as policies, legislation, regulations,  and the rules and regulations set out in pipeline and rail tariffs). When there  are changes to market rules or conditions, companies may adapt in ways that are  difficult to foresee.</p>
<p>Accordingly,  any actions need to be carefully considered. Broad consultation across industry  stakeholders, regulators and governments at all levels would be required. Many  of the options would also require regulatory changes or adjudication by a  regulatory body such as the NEB following a regulatory process.</p>

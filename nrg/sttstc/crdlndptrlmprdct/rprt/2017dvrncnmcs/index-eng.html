<h2>National Energy Board</h2>
<p>The <a href="/index.html">National Energy Board</a> (NEB or Board) is an independent national energy regulator. The Board&rsquo;s  main responsibilities include regulating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the       construction, operation, and abandonment of pipelines that cross       international borders or provincial/territorial boundaries;</li>
  <li>associated       pipeline tolls and tariffs;</li>
  <li>the       construction and operation of international power lines and designated       interprovincial power lines;</li>
  <li>imports       of natural gas and exports of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids,       refined petroleum products, and electricity; and</li>
  <li>oil       and gas exploration and production activities in specified northern and       offshore areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NEB is  also charged with providing timely, accurate and objective information and  advice on energy matters. </p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Following a recent study that assessed the Duvernay  Shale&rsquo;s marketable petroleum resources, the NEB assessed the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s  economic resources. At 2017 light sweet crude oil prices, natural gas prices,  and well costs, the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic oil resource is 156 million cubic  metres (m<sup>3</sup>) or 1.0 billion barrels, about one third of the  Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable oil resource. Meanwhile, the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic natural  gas resource is 339 billion m<sup>3</sup> (12.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)); 16%  of the Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable natural gas resource. The Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s  economic natural gas liquid (NGL) resource is 216 million m<sup>3</sup> (1.4  billion barrels), about one fifth of the Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable NGL resource.</p>
	<div class="well well-sm">
	  <p>Marketable petroleum resources are the amount of  sales-quality petroleum that can be recovered from a formation using existing  technology. Economic resources are a subset of marketable resources and  estimate how much of that marketable petroleum is economic to recover under certain  economic conditions.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Should well costs continue to fall and crude oil and natural  gas prices modestly rise, the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic oil resource would increase  to 350 million m<sup>3</sup> (2.2 billion barrels), almost two thirds of the  Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable oil resources. The Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic natural gas  resource would increase to 932 billion m<sup>3</sup> (32.9 Tcf), over 40% of its  marketable natural gas resources. The Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s NGL resource would  increase to 536 million m<sup>3</sup> (3.4 billion barrels), over half of the  Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable NGL resources.</p>
	<p>Duvernay Shale economics are very sensitive to declines  in well costs. As well costs fall, increases to oil and gas prices cause  economic resources to grow more rapidly than they would with higher well costs (i.e.,  the supply-cost curves flatten, and even small increases to prices can  significantly increase the amount of economic resources). Well performance that  improves at the same scale of falling well costs would likely affect economic  resources in a similar manner. </p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Since 2011, companies have been testing the  Duvernay Shale of Alberta for shale gas and shale oil. Importantly,  the Duvernay Shale is also rich in NGLs, including condensate.<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>Condensate  is often mixed with bitumen produced from the Alberta oil sands so the bitumen  can be thinned and shipped in oil pipelines. The NEB, using data provided by  the Alberta Geological Survey (AGS), recently assessed the <a href="/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/rprt/2017dvrn/index-eng.html">marketable  petroleum resources of the Duvernay Shale</a>,  which is a measure of how much sales-quality oil, gas, and NGLs might  ultimately be recovered from the formation. </p>
<p>However, there is a difference between marketable  resources and economic resources. Marketable resources are largely a measure of  geology and technology, while economic resources consider how much of the  marketable resources are economic to recover under certain economic conditions.  These economic conditions are the oil and gas prices required for a well to earn  a minimum return on investment.</p>
<p>For more information on the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s basic  geology and how its marketable resources were estimated, please see the NEB and  AGS report.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Supply  costs for the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s marketable resources were estimated by finding  the crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices required for a well to cover its  costs and earn a 10% profit in each square-mile tract of the original Duvernay  resource assessment. Gas supply costs were determined by holding some assumed  oil prices constant. Oil supply costs were determined by holding some assumed natural  gas prices constant. Well production varied by local geology and its oil, natural  gas, and NGL contents were based on AGS maps of the in-place resource.<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></p>
<p>Costs  included the cost to drill and hydraulically fracture a well (adjusted to the  Duvernay&rsquo;s local depth), operating costs, shipping costs to Alberta trading  hubs, income taxes, royalties, and a carbon tax<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> on  upstream and midstream emissions. Future revenues were discounted by 8% per  year.<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> NGL  prices were indexed to crude oil. Several different scenarios were run to  estimate supply costs at different well costs and fixed crude oil and natural  gas prices. Details are available in Appendix B.</p>
	<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2>Results and Observations</h2>
	<p>So far in 2017, Western Canadian light sweet oil prices at  Edmonton have averaged about C$60/bbl and natural gas prices at Nova Inventory  Transfer (NIT) about C$2.50/GJ. For 2018, the AER projects oil and natural gas  prices will increase to about C$70/bbl<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> and  C$3.00/GJ, respectively.<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> Meanwhile,  costs to develop shale gas and shale oil typically fall over time because  operators learn from previous wells and increase efficiencies when drilling  newer wells. </p>
	<p>Altogether, once modeled, changes to well costs<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> and  commodity prices significantly change the size of the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic  resource (Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 3 to 6).<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> Tables 1  and 2 show the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic resources at C$60/bbl for crude oil  and C$2.50/GJ for natural gas (in metric and imperial, respectively).	</p>

	<p>To summarize, at 2017 light sweet crude oil prices,  natural gas prices, and well costs, the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic oil resource  is 156 million cubic metres (m<sup>3</sup>) or 1.0 billion barrels; about one  third of the Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable oil resource. Meanwhile, the Duvernay  Shale&rsquo;s economic natural gas resource is 339 billion m<sup>3</sup> (12.0  trillion cubic feet (Tcf)); 16% of the Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable natural gas  resource. The Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic natural gas liquid (NGL) resource is  216 million m<sup>3</sup> (1.4 billion barrels), about one fifth of the  Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable NGL resource.</p>
	<p>Should well costs continue to fall and crude oil and  natural gas prices modestly rise, the Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s economic oil resource  would increase to 350 million m<sup>3</sup> (2.2 billion barrels), almost two  thirds of the Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable oil resources. The Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s  economic natural gas resource would increase to 932 billion m<sup>3</sup> (32.9  Tcf), over 40% of its marketable natural gas resources. The Duvernay Shale&rsquo;s  NGL resource would increase to 536 million m<sup>3</sup> (3.4 billion barrels),  over half of the Duvernay&rsquo;s marketable NGL resources.</p>
	<p>Some areas of the Duvernay natural gas resource are  economic at negative gas prices. This indicates that, in those areas, companies  earn enough revenue from the oil and NGL production from a well that they can  lose money on the natural gas production and still make a profit.</p>
	<p>Overall, Duvernay Shale economics  are very sensitive to declines in well costs as indicated by Figures 3 to 6. As  well costs fall, increases to oil and gas prices cause economic resources to  grow more rapidly than they would with higher well costs (i.e., the supply-cost  curves flatten, and even small increases to prices can significantly increase  the amount of economic resources).</p>
	<p>Importantly, well production in the original NEB and AGS  study was based on the average well drilled in 2016, and the size of 2017 and  2018 economic resources could be underestimated if well performance for newer  wells has since improved. Improved technology often increases well performance  and has been a key reason why supply costs of shale oil and shale gas  production have been falling in North America over the past 10 years. </p>
	<p>In particular, increases in well performance should have  similar effects on supply costs as capital cost reductions of the same size  (for example, a 20% increase in well production over its lifetime would have a  similar effect on supply costs as a 20%  reduction in costs to drill and hydraulically  fracture that well). Thus, while the effects of increased well performance on  supply costs were not modeled for this economic analysis, the reduction in  supply costs from year to year can be a guide to how the economic resource  could grow from 2017 to 2018 if the performance of new wells increases by 20%  (or if there is a combination of cost reductions and improved well performance equivalent  to a 20% reduction in capital costs). </p>

<h3>Key Assumptions</h3>
<p>Well production  is based on existing technology, current trends in development, and limited  amounts of historical production. No detailed analyses of technological  advancements have been performed for this study. Recoveries and levels of  development could be different in the future as technology advances and the  play matures.</p>
<h3>Study Area</h3>
<p>As in the  original study, the study area was broken down into tracts<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup> of  approximately one-square mile in size. Some tracts were excluded from the  analysis because they were considered unlikely to be developed; such as where  the Duvernay Shale is less than 10 m thick, is underpressured<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup>,  where its mapped in-place natural gas contents are less than 50 m<sup>3</sup>  of volume per m<sup>2</sup> of area, and where oil contents were more than 2 000  barrels per million cubic feet of gas. Only 27 819 square kilometres (km<sup>2</sup>)  of the full 108 244 km<sup>2</sup> assessed by the AER for in-place resources  (or 10 803 of the study area&rsquo;s 42 012 square-mile tracts) were included after  these criteria were applied (Figure B1).</p>

<h3>Production-curve Modeling and Estimation of Resources</h3>
<p>Please see  Appendix B of the NEB and AGS resources report.</p>
<h3>Supply Costs</h3>
<p>Each tract&rsquo;s  supply costs for marketable crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs were estimated by  determining the crude oil and natural gas prices<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup> needed so that a typical development well could earn a 10% rate of return once  its net present costs were subtracted from its net present revenues. Natural  gas supply costs were determined using a series of fixed crude oil prices (from  C$50/bbl to C$100/bbl in $10 increments) while crude oil supply costs were determined  using a series of fixed natural gas prices (from C$2.00/GJ to C$4.50/GJ in  $0.50 increments). Natural gas prices were assumed to be C$/GJ at NIT<sup id="fn12-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup>,  and crude oil prices were assumed to be light, sweet, crude oil in C$/bbl at  Edmonton. All costs were in Canadian dollars, so no exchange rate was used. All  prices and costs used were in 2017 dollars.</p>
<p>The marketable  production for a typical development well in a tract was estimated in the same  way that a tract&rsquo;s estimated ultimately recoverable (EUR) marketable production  was estimated, except that the well&rsquo;s horizontal leg length was increased to  2.5 km from 1.6 km. Thus the development well&rsquo;s estimated supply costs could be  applied to the tract&rsquo;s EURs of marketable natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs.</p>
<p>Monthly revenues  for a development well in a tract were estimated from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The heat content of the monthly  marketable natural gas (including unrecovered NGLs) and marketable ethane;</li>
  <li>The volumes of monthly NGLs other than  ethane, as indexed to the crude oil price <br>
    (40% for propane, 70% for butanes, and 105% for pentanes plus); and</li>
  <li>The volume of monthly crude oil, with  a 5% premium to the crude oil price because of the high demand for condensate  and very light oil to be used as diluent in western Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Costs for a  development well in each tract were determined on the basis of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The capital cost of drilling and  completing a well in a tract, as based on the equation for the Drilling and  Completion Cost Allowance (C*) of Alberta&rsquo;s Modernized Royalty Framework (MRF).  Each well was assumed to have a vertical depth measured to the top of the  Duvernay Formation in the tract and a 2.5 km horizontal leg. Each well was also  assumed to use 600 tonnes of proppant.<sup id="fn13-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup> The capital cost was assumed to include tying the well into local natural gas  gathering pipelines. The capital cost of abandoning the well at the end of its  productive life ($100 000) was also included. Three well cost scenarios (as  based on reported costs by industry from 2015, 2016, and 2017) were used to find  how changing capital costs can alter supply costs, including the shape of the  resource&rsquo;s cost curve. An additional, future well cost scenario was used to  model how supply costs change if well costs continue to fall.
    <ul>
      <li>2015 well costs were assumed to be 125%  of estimated C*;</li>
      <li>2016 well costs were assumed to be  100% of estimated C*;</li>
      <li>2017 well costs (or current well  costs) were assumed to be 80% of estimated C*; and</li>
      <li>2018 well costs (or future well costs  if companies continue to increase operational efficiencies) were assumed to be  64% of estimated C* (i.e., 20% less than 2017 well costs).</li>
      <li>This study assumes 2015 through 2018  well costs would not vary with changes to calculated supply costs nor with the  fixed crude oil and natural gas prices the supply costs are paired with (e.g.,  a well that is marginally economic when crude oil is C$60/bbl and natural gas  C$2.50/GJ would cost the same as a well when crude oil is C$70/bbl and gas  C$3.00/GJ). In reality, higher crude oil and natural gas prices cause cost  inflation because activity increases across the crude oil and natural gas  sector. Thus, well costs and their associated supply costs would likely be  higher than estimated for some of the higher crude oil and natural gas prices  in this study (e.g., fixed crude oil prices at C$100/bbl and fixed gas prices  at C$4.50/GJ).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No petroleum land rights costs,  because prospective rights were largely purchased for prospective areas before  2017 and these costs are already sunk.</li>
  <li>No geological and geophysical costs.</li>
  <li>Monthly operating costs, with fixed  monthly costs of $2 000/month plus variable costs of $0.85 per thousand cubic  feet (mcf) for raw natural gas and $7.00/barrel for crude oil.</li>
  <li>Monthly shipping costs of $0.25/GJ for  marketable natural gas to NIT and ethane to Edmonton, and $2/barrel for other  NGLs and crude oil to Edmonton.</li>
  <li>Monthly royalties as determined by  Alberta&rsquo;s MRF, including pre-payout, payout, and mature royalty rates.<sup id="fn14-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> Payout and mature royalty rates were based on Alberta Energy&rsquo;s royalty  equations, which consider crude oil and natural gas prices and production  rates. The C* Drilling and Completion Cost Allowance, which determines how much  revenue a producer can collect from a well before the pre-payout period ends,  was estimated by the well depth, horizontal leg length, and proppant used  (assuming 600 tonnes). C* was then adjusted upward by 25% to include the  Alberta&rsquo;s Emerging Resources Program, which allows companies to increase their  C* allowance by 50% to 100% for the first 15% of wells drilled on a prospect.</li>
  <li>Monthly corporate income taxes, both  federal (15%) and provincial (12%), including deductions for operating costs,  shipping costs, royalties, and carbon taxes.
    <ul>
      <li>Deductions include the federal Capital  Development Expense as based on the capital cost of the well.<sup id="fn15-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>15</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A monthly, escalating carbon tax was  applied to dry natural gas consumed for natural gas processing and transmission  (0.117 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e)/mcf). Fuel gas for  wellsite operations, however, was excluded because Alberta&rsquo;s carbon levy  currently does not apply to it. The carbon tax was also applied to crude oil  and NGLs shipped by pipeline to Edmonton (0.000414 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/bbl/km) as  based on GHG-intensity estimates for shipping synthetic crude oil.<sup id="fn16-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup> The carbon tax was assumed to start at $20/tonne and escalate to a maximum of  $50/tonne over 5 years. A carbon tax of $20/tonne was added to the capital  costs as based on 300 000 litres (L) of gasoline (2.31 kgCO<sub>2</sub>/L) used for drilling and well completion as well as  trucking of equipment, personnel, supplies, and flowback water handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The financial  assumptions included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 10% rate of return.</li>
  <li>An 8% discount rate (based on the cost  of capital).</li>
  <li>Constant crude oil and natural gas  prices, and no cost inflation applied to operating costs and shipping costs.</li>
  <li>For determining EURs, wells would be  abandoned after 40 years of production.</li>
  <li>No corporate overhead.</li>

<p>Duvernay Shale resource economics were estimated using four well cost  scenarios. Well costs from 2016 were used as a baseline. Well costs for 2015  were assumed to be 25 per cent higher than 2016 well costs while well costs  from 2017 were assumed to be 20 per cent below 2016 well costs (consistent with  cost reductions reported by industry).

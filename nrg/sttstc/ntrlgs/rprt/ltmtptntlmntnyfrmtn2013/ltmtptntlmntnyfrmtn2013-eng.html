          <h3 id="s1_1">National Energy Board</h3>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board is an independent federal regulator
            established to promote safety and security, environmental protection
            and economic interest within the mandate set by Parliament for the
            regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade. The Board's
            main responsibilities include regulating the construction and
            operation of interprovincial and international oil and natural gas
            pipelines, international power lines, and designated interprovincial
            power lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            For oil and natural gas exports, the Board’s role is to evaluate
            whether the oil and natural gas proposed to be exported is surplus
            to reasonably foreseeable Canadian requirements, having regard to
            the trends in the discovery of oil or gas in Canada.
          </p>

            The Montney Formation’s marketable, unconventional petroleum
            potential has been evaluated for the first time in a joint
            assessment by the National Energy Board, the British Columbia Oil

            Columbia Ministry of Natural Gas Development. The thick and
            geographically extensive siltstones of the Montney Formation are
            expected to contain 12,719&nbsp;billion m&sup3; (449&nbsp;Tcf) of
            marketable natural gas, 2,308&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;

          <h2 id="s3">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The Montney Formation of Alberta and British Columbia (<a href="#f1"
              >Figure&nbsp;1</a
            >) has been the target of oil and gas exploration since
            the&nbsp;1950s, with industry traditionally focusing on the
            Montney’s conventional sandstone and dolostone reservoirs. These
            conventional reservoirs are encased in siltstone, which represents a
            far greater volume of rock within the formation and also contains
            oil and gas. However, Montney siltstones remained undeveloped until
            2005, when advances in horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic
            fracturing made it possible to economically develop this extensive,
            unconventional siltstone resource.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this report, the National Energy Board (NEB), the British
            Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (BC OGC), the Alberta Energy
            Regulator (AER), and the British Columbia Ministry of Natural Gas
            Development (BC MNGD), collectively the Agencies, have jointly
            assessed the unconventional petroleum resources of the Montney
            Formation.<sup><a href="#ftn2back" id="ftn2">[2]</a></sup> For
            British Columbia, both the in-place and marketable<sup
              ><a href="#ftn3back" id="ftn3">[3]</a></sup
            >
            petroleum volumes were estimated for the Montney siltstone, which
            included some thin sandstones that were unlikely to be developed
            conventionally. For Alberta, only marketable petroleum volumes were
            estimated because the in-place petroleum of Montney Formation
            siltstone was already determined in a prior study by the Energy
            Resources Conservation Board (now the AER). This is the first
            publicly released study to examine the marketable, unconventional
            petroleum potential of the Montney Formation in any detail.

          <h2 id="s4">Geological Description</h2>
          <p>
            The Lower Triassic Montney Formation is aerially extensive, covering
            approximately 130,000 km&sup2; (Figure&nbsp;1). It is also thick,
            typically ranging from 100&nbsp;m to 300&nbsp;m, though thins to
            zero at its eastern and northeastern edges while increasing to over
            300&nbsp;m on its western side before it begins outcropping in the
            Rocky Mountains. Most of the formation consists of siltstone
            containing small amounts of sandstone that originally collected on
            the bottom of a deep sea, whereas more porous sandstones and shell
            beds were deposited in shallow water environments to the east. The
            depth of the formation also increases from northeast to southwest,
            generally along with increasing reservoir pressures and decreasing
            natural gas liquid<sup><a href="#ftn4back" id="ftn4">[4]</a></sup>
            (NGL) and oil content. Thus, reservoir characteristics vary widely
            across the formation.

          <h2 id="s5">Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            For British Columbia, the Montney was assessed using a process
            similar to one used in a 2011 study of the shale gas resources in
            the Horn River Basin.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn9back" id="ftn9">[9]</a></sup
            >
            In the Horn River Basin assessment, the volumes of free gas and
            adsorbed gas<sup><a href="#ftn10back" id="ftn10">[10]</a></sup> were
            determined by connecting map grids of geological data to free gas
            and adsorbed gas equations. This way, gas volumes could be estimated
            by location and capture how the geological nature of the shales
            changed from place to place. Statistical distributions were applied
            to some variables in the equations and then Monte Carlo simulations
            were used to estimate low, expected, and high values.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn11back" id="ftn11">[11]</a></sup
            >
            However, the Montney assessment was expanded to include NGLs and
            oil, which are not present in the Horn River Basin to any
            significant degree. Dissolved gas, which is gas that is dissolved in
            oil deep underground but is liberated at surface under lower
            pressures, was also estimated for the Montney. Altogether, in-place
            and marketable petroleum resources were determined for dry natural
            gas<sup><a href="#ftn12back" id="ftn12">[12]</a></sup
            >, NGLs, and oil. Only over-pressured<sup
              ><a href="#ftn13back" id="ftn13">[13]</a></sup
            >
            areas were included in the British Columbia analysis, because
            unconventional development has so far been limited to over-pressured
            areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Alberta portion of the Montney, the in-place volumes of dry
            natural gas, NGLs, and oil have already been estimated as part of
            Alberta’s two resource studies, their methodology described in the
            publication
            <em>Quantification of Uncertainty in Shale Gas Resources</em>.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn14back" id="ftn14">[14]</a></sup
            >
            For this joint study, a marketable resource volume was estimated by
            applying recovery factors to map grids of Alberta’s in-place
            resource data. Because Montney development is occurring in both
            over-pressured and under-pressured areas in Alberta, the entire
            Montney unconventional play was assessed for marketable resources.
            Full development was assumed to occur in deeper areas (where the
            Montney mid-point depth was more than 1750&nbsp;m) as these have a
            higher chance of being over-pressured according to pressure-depth
            data. Shallower areas are expected to have only partial development
            because they are typically under-pressured. Thus, a “development
            risk” factor was applied to shallower areas, as well as lower
            recovery factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conventional reservoirs within the Montney section were excluded
            from this analysis as these have been assessed in prior studies.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn15back" id="ftn15">[15]</a>,<a
                href="#ftn16back"
                id="ftn16"
                >[16]</a
              ></sup
            >
            Further, the methods for determining the in-place resources for each
            province, while similar, did have some significant differences. The
            geological mapping of the Montney Formation in British Columbia
            included some thin sandstones unlikely to be developed
            conventionally, while all sandstone was excluded from the Alberta
            analyses. No extra Monte Carlo simulations were run when adding
            British Columbia’s and Alberta’s low, expected, and high values
            together. Thus, while the addition between provinces is not
            statistically rigorous, the total results should still provide a
            reasonable estimate of total potential. More details on the
            methodology are available in <a href="#nnxa">Appendix&nbsp;A</a>.

          <p>
            The ultimate potential for unconventional petroleum in the Montney
            Formation is estimated to be very large
            <a href="#t1">(Table&nbsp;1</a>), with expected volumes of
            12,719&nbsp;billion m&sup3; (449&nbsp;Tcf) of marketable natural
            gas, 2,308&nbsp;million m&sup3; (14,521&nbsp;million&nbsp;barrels)
            of marketable NGLs, and 179&nbsp;million m&sup3; (1,125&nbsp;million
            barrels) of marketable oil.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn17back" id="ftn17">[17]</a></sup
            >
            Uncertainty in the estimates is reflected by the spread between
            estimated low and high values in <a href="#t1">Table&nbsp;1</a>.<sup

          <p>
            The Montney’s marketable unconventional gas resource is one of the
            largest in the world. While most of it is located in British
            Columbia (<a href="#t2">Table&nbsp;2</a>), Alberta’s share is still
            large (<a href="#t3">Table&nbsp;3</a>). To further illustrate the
            size of the Montney, total Canadian natural gas demand in&nbsp;2012
            was 88&nbsp;billion m&sup3; (3.1&nbsp;Tcf)<sup
              ><a href="#ftn19back" id="ftn19">[19]</a></sup
            >, making the Montney gas resource equivalent to 145&nbsp;years of
            Canada’s 2012 consumption. In addition, the Montney is already
            considered one of Canada’s most economic gas plays.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn20back" id="ftn20">[20]</a></sup
            >
            Even though it is only in the early stages of development, its 2012
            production rose to an average of 48.6&nbsp;million m&sup3;/d
            (1.7&nbsp;Bcf/d) out of total Canadian marketable gas production of
            392.7&nbsp;million m&sup3;/d (13.9&nbsp;Bcf/d).
            <sup><a href="#ftn21back" id="ftn21">[21]</a></sup> It is expected
            that Montney gas production will continue to increase and grow its
            share of Canadian production.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn22back" id="ftn22">[22]</a></sup
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            By combining this marketable gas estimate with prior assessments,
            including the most recent estimates of western Canadian ultimate
            potential for <strong>conventional</strong> natural gas, the total
            ultimate potential in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB)
            has more than doubled to 23,249&nbsp;billion&nbsp;m&sup3;
            (821&nbsp;Tcf) (<a href="#t4">Table&nbsp;4</a>). Out of this total,
            17,898&nbsp;billion&nbsp;m&sup3; (632&nbsp;Tcf) is remaining after
            cumulative production to year-end&nbsp;2012 is subtracted. The
            ultimate potential for natural gas should be considered an estimate
            that will evolve, likely growing over time as additional
            unconventional potential can be found in unassessed shales, such as
            those in the Liard Basin of British Columbia and the Duvernay
            Formation of Alberta. Overall, Canada has a very large remaining
            natural gas resource base in the WCSB to serve its markets well into
            the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The marketable unconventional NGL and oil volumes in the Montney
            Formation are also very large. However, the volume of marketable
            oil, which is almost entirely found in Alberta, remains highly
            uncertain, as indicated by the wide spread between its low and high
            values. This is because the areas that are richest in Montney
            unconventional oil tend to be in shallower areas, where uncertainty
            about development is much greater. The Montney unconventional oil
            resource is only in the initial stages of development, with
            its&nbsp;2012 production averaging only 4108&nbsp;m&sup3;/d
            (25,845&nbsp;b/d), a small component of total Canadian 2012 oil
            production, which averaged 513,960&nbsp;m&sup3;/d
            (3.23&nbsp;million&nbsp;b/d). Alberta’s marketable NGL volumes are
            also highly uncertain, mostly because the in-place volumes are also
            largely found in shallower areas.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The methodology for the analysis of the British Columbia portion of
            the Montney petroleum resource is largely based on a prior study
            that examined the shale-gas resources in the Horn River Basin<sup
              ><a href="#ftn23back" id="ftn23">[23]</a></sup
            >, although it incorporates some new approaches to reflect
            geological differences in the reservoirs plus feedback received
            after the initial study. For the Alberta portion of the Montney
            petroleum resource, the in-place estimate had already been
            determined in two Alberta studies<sup
              ><a href="#ftn24back" id="ftn24">[24]</a>,<a
                href="#ftn25back"

            from which a recoverable estimate was extracted for this study.
            Please see the two Alberta studies as well as
            <em>Quantification of Uncertainty in Shale Gas</em
            ><sup><a href="#ftn26back" id="ftn26">[26]</a></sup> for more
            details on the AER’s methodologies and assumptions.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Assumptions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In British Columbia, the petroleum resource was considered to be a
              resource play, pervasively distributed through the geologically
              defined area, though its constituents (oil, gas, and NGLs) could
              vary depending upon location. Thus, the chance of success at
              discovering petroleum with a well is 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. In
              Alberta’s assessments of in-place petroleum potential, the range
              of water saturations included the possibility of having
              water-saturated wells, thus the chance of petroleum discovery was
              not necessarily 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.
            </li>

            <li>
              In British Columbia, thin sandstones unlikely to be targeted by
              conventional development were included within the siltstone
              section. In Alberta, all sandstones were excluded from the
              in-place evaluations and were therefore excluded from this
              assessment.
            </li>
            <li>
              No study has been undertaken to determine the economics for
              marketable resources and the determination of what is economic is
              based on the view of the Agencies. Prior studies have estimated
              the supply cost of the Montney gas resource to be one of the
              lowest cost in western Canada, however.<sup
                ><a href="#ftn27back" id="ftn27">[27]</a></sup
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Recovery factors are based on existing technology, current trends
              in development, and limited production. No detailed analyses of
              technological advancements have been performed for this study. The
              recovery factors and levels of development could be different in
              the future as technology advances and the play matures, in
              particular in the shallower areas of Alberta and under-pressured
              areas of British Columbia.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stratigraphy and Study Area</h3>
          <h4><strong>Stratigraphic Intervals</strong></h4>
          <p>
            In British Columbia, the Lower Triassic Montney Formation was
            treated as a single unit. In Alberta, a siltstone unit near the
            bottom of the overlying Doig Formation was included with the Montney
            because it is stratigraphically equivalent to the Upper Montney in
            British Columbia (<a href="#fa1">Figure&nbsp;A.1</a>). The
            two&nbsp;sections of rock in Alberta were then treated as a single
            unit for the assessment.

          <h4>Play Area</h4>
          <p>
            For British Columbia, the assessment was limited to over-pressured
            areas due to a lack of unconventional development in under-pressured
            areas. However, the uncertainty model that was applied to the
            pressure-gradient map during Monte Carlo simulations could change
            typically under-pressured areas into over-pressured areas in the
            case of “high” scenarios, and could change typically over-pressured
            areas into under-pressured areas in “low” scenarios, thus the
            boundary between over-pressured areas and under-pressured areas
            varied by modeled iteration. Over-pressured areas were then assumed
            to be fully developed in order to determine marketable resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Alberta, the play area was the geographical extent of mapped
            in-place, siltstone-hosted petroleum resources as determined during
            Alberta’s previous studies. The entire area was assessed for
            marketable resources because development appears to be occurring in
            both over-pressured and under-pressured areas; however, the Montney
            was divided into two different development areas as based on depth.
            Areas deeper than 1750&nbsp;m were considered to be more likely
            developed than shallower areas, as based on current exploration
            trends.
          </p>
          <h4>Tracts</h4>
          <p>
            Because of computational limitations, the British Columbia Montney
            data was aggregated on an NTS (National Topographic System) block
            basis instead of a smaller grid-spacing unit (GSU) basis, including
            over the Peace River Block, where values were converted from the DLS
            (domain land survey) grid to the NTS grid. In Alberta, the Montney
            data was aggregated on a township basis rather than by section. The
            equations to determine petroleum volumes were then applied to each
            NTS and township tract.

          <p>
            Like the Horn River Basin assessment, this assessment was done on a
            map-grid basis where, at each grid point, Monte Carlo simulations
            were run on a series of mathematical equations to determine volumes
            and the results summed to determine the total. Further, the
            assessment was integrated at two levels: i)&nbsp;a tract-by-tract
            scale; and ii)&nbsp;a basin scale (<a href="#fga2"
              >Figure&nbsp;A.2</a
            >) in order to try to incorporate local changes with uncertainties
            inherent at the basin level. Please see the “Resource Modeling”
            section of the 2011 Horn River Basin assessment for more details on
            this “distribution of distributions” methodology.

          <p>
            Most of the maps for the Montney Formation already exist in the
            <em>Montney Formation Play Atlas NEBC</em
            ><sup><a href="#ftn28back" id="ftn28">[28]</a></sup
            >, such as depth, thickness, and pressure gradient maps. Other maps
            were constructed solely for this assessment, such as the gas
            compressibility and “propane plus” molar fraction maps. See
            <a href="#ta1">Table&nbsp;A.1</a> for the variables in the
            assessment based on mapped data as well as the variables (both
            mapped and unmapped) that had distributions attached to them for the
            Monte Carlo simulations. Because the Montney Formation was treated
            as a single unit, variables like porosity, water saturation, and
            total organic content were applied as averages over the entire rock
            section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the Horn River Basin assessment, no net pay cutoff was used
            for the Montney in British Columbia. Sandstones, where present
            within the siltstone within British Columbia, were included in the
            unconventional play if those sandstones were unlikely to be
            developed conventionally. Porosities in less prospective areas were
            assigned lower average porosities than in more prospective areas
            (i.e.,&nbsp;porosities were reduced where depth was greater than
            2800&nbsp;m, or where thickness was greater than 300&nbsp;m and the
            tract was on the western half of the British Columbia map). To
            reduce potential skewing of distributions modeled on mapped data,
            “soft” maximums or minimums for distribution curves were used
            (i.e.,&nbsp;the distribution’s low and high values wandered based on
            a percentage of the mapped “most likely” values) rather than “hard”
            maximum or minimums as long as the soft values did not exceed or
            fall below impossible values, such as creating negative numbers.
            Further, when applying the basin-scale distribution to the
            tract-scale distribution, variables that could have zero as a
            minimum (such as porosity or water saturation) always had their
            minimums tied to zero. As a result, not only did the maximums and
            most likely values vary for those distributions at the tract level,
            but the shape of the curve could also change. For distributions
            modeled on the pressure gradient, the range between a tract’s low
            and high values was reduced as determined by the number of reservoir
            pressure measurements in it, which increased certainty in the mapped
            pressures.
          </p>

            Finally, typical solution gas ratios and formation volume factors
            from Montney and Doig oil pools in British Columbia, as well as
            gas-to-oil ratios obtained from production data, were applied to an
            emerging oil play in British Columbia to back-calculate local free
            oil and free gas contents at reservoir conditions.

          <h5>British Columbia - In-place Resources Equations</h5>
          <p>
            Natural gas and NGLs in the Montney Formation are present in three
            forms: free, adsorbed, and dissolved. Therefore, the total raw
            natural gas stored in the Montney Formation prior to production can
            be determined by using the following basic equation at each grid
            point:

            The assessment of Montney unconventional oil in British Columbia
            considers only free oil, which comprises a very small component of
            the total resource. Thus:

            Marketable adsorbed dry gas, which is the amount of gas that can
            desorb from the organic and mineral matter in the formation at
            well-abandonment pressures and then be recovered by moving through
            the reservoir to any well, was estimated with the equation:

            Dissolved gas was assumed to be extracted with the free gas where
            present in the same reservoir, as subsurface de-pressurization
            during free-gas extraction would cause some dissolved gas to come
            out of solution from the oil. Therefore, the same recovery factor
            for free gas was applied to the dissolved gas. While this would
            likely lead to an overestimate of marketable dissolved gas, it forms
            a very small portion of the overall resource and its impact on the
            total results is minimal.

            Free marketable and dissolved marketable NGLs (with the same
            potential overestimation of dissolved NGLs as for dissolved dry gas)
            were estimated with the equations:

          <p>
            Marketable adsorbed NGLs were estimated slightly differently than
            marketable dry gas. Since the heavier the hydrocarbon is the more
            prone it is to adsorption, it was assumed that only ethane and
            propane would desorb from organic matter during depressurization of
            the reservoir during production. Further, the amount of ethane
            desorbed was reduced by 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent and propane by
            75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent because of their stronger affinities relative
            to methane. Thus:

          <h5>Alberta - Marketable Resources Equations</h5>
          <p>
            Because a range of in-place volumes of dry gas, NGLs, and oil for
            the Alberta Montney play had already been determined, including
            values for the lowermost Doig siltstone, only the recoverable
            quantities were estimated for this study. Rather than separately
            estimating recoverable quantities for each unit, the results of
            in-place Monte Carlo simulations for the Alberta Montney and
            lowermost Doig siltstone were added together on a
            township-by-township and iteration-by-iteration basis. The combined
            result was then re-simulated by using @Risk software’s Resample
            function, during which recovery factors were applied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on current trends in development, the Montney play in Alberta
            is largely being developed where the Montney depth is 1750&nbsp;m or
            greater, though small developments are occurring in shallower areas.
            Thus, a development factor was applied to simulate the effects of
            partial development. The minimum development factor for a township
            was determined by how many sections in it contained either the
            surface hole or bottom hole location of existing or licensed
            horizontal Montney wells. A township where none of its sections had
            locations was assigned a minimum of 0. The maximum value for a
            township was then assumed to be&nbsp;1 and the most likely&nbsp;0.3
            more than the minimum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Higher recovery factors were applied to the Montney Formation where
            the formation mid-point was deeper than 1750&nbsp;m, with the most
            likely value assumed to be 15&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for gas, as in
            British Columbia, though a 2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent most likely value
            was applied to the deep Montney oil resource given Alberta’s more
            mature development. Lower recovery factors were applied where
            formation mid-point depths were shallower than 1750&nbsp;m, the most
            likely value assumed to be 10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for gas and
            1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for oil. Lower recovery factors in shallower
            areas are supported by available pressure data, which demonstrates
            that shallower areas in the Alberta Montney have a much greater
            tendency to be under-pressured. Dissolved gas was not considered to
            be recoverable, thus the amount of marketable gas in the Alberta
            Montney siltstone may be somewhat underestimated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, marketable Alberta resources were estimated with the
            equations where <em>DF</em> is the development factor:

          />
          <p>
            <em>DR</em> is a desorption-reducing factor, because not all
            adsorbed gas would be able to be desorbed by the time a well was
            abandoned. This was assumed to be 0.33 as based on the results of
            the British Columbia analysis.

            rock’s pore spaces; adsorbed gas is gas “stuck” to the side of any
            organic matter or clay present in the rock.

          <p>
            <a href="#ftn11" id="ftn11back">[11]</a> A Monte Carlo simulation is
            a computerized process where random numbers (as determined from a
            statistical distribution) are picked hundreds to thousands of times
            to help determine a range of possibilities and uncertainty in an
            estimate.

          <p>
            <a href="#ftn12" id="ftn12back">[12]</a> “Dry natural gas” is
            natural gas with the NGL contents and other impurities removed to
            make the gas ready to be shipped in gas distribution systems and
            sold to consumers.

            <a href="#ftn13" id="ftn13back">[13]</a> Higher than normal oil and
            gas pressures for that depth. Over-pressured formations can store
            more natural gas, because the gas is further compressed, and tend to
            have significant internal “push” to drive the petroleum out,
            improving recoveries and making economics better. “Normal” can be
            generally considered what the pressure would be under a column of
            water to that depth.

            in this report are cubic metres (m&sup3;), cubic metres per day
            (m&sup3;/d), billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), trillion cubic feet
            (Tcf), and barrels per day (b/d).

            <a href="#ftn18" id="ftn18back">[18]</a> “Low” and “high”, as used
            here, refer to a range where there is reasonably high confidence
            that the real in-place and eventual produced marketable volumes from
            the Montney will fall inside it. Thus, there is a small chance that
            real in-place and produced marketable volumes could be lower than
            the low values or higher than the high values.

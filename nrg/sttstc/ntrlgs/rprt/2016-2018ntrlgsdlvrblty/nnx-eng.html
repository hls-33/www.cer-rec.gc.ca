          <p>
            Canadian natural gas deliverability from 2016 to 2018 will consist
            of conventional gas supply from the WCSB with contributions from
            Atlantic Canada, Ontario, CBM production from Alberta, and shale gas
            production from Alberta and B.C. In this report, an analysis of
            trends in well production characteristics and resource development
            expectations was undertaken to develop parameters that define future
            natural gas deliverability from the WCSB. A different approach was
            undertaken for other regions of Canada where production is sourced
            from a smaller number of wells.
          </p>
          <h4 id="sa11">A1.1 WCSB Gas Supply</h4>
          <p>
            To assess gas deliverability for the WCSB, gas production was split
            into two major categories as shown in
            <a href="#fa11">Figure&nbsp;A1.1</a>.

            The methodology to determine gas deliverability associated with
            conventional gas connections (including tight gas), CBM connections,
            and shale gas is described below. The methodology to determine gas
            deliverability related to oil connections (solution gas) is
            described in <a href="#sa112">Section&nbsp;A.1.1.2</a> of this
            appendix.
          </p>
          <h5 id="sa111">A1.1.1 Gas Connections from Gas Wells</h5>
          <p>
            The methodology used to assess deliverability is mostly the same for
            conventional gas connections (including tight gas), CBM connections
            and shale gas connections. Production decline analysis on historical
            production data was used to determine parameters that define future
            performance.

            A1.1.1.1 Groupings for Production Decline Analysis
          </h5>
          <p>
            Different groupings of conventional gas connections (including tight
            gas), shale gas, and CBM connections were made to assess well
            performance characteristics. Conventional gas connections were
            grouped geographically on the basis of the Petrocube areas in
            Alberta, B.C., and Saskatchewan, as shown in
            <a href="#fa12">Figure&nbsp;A1.2</a>. Conventional and shale gas
            connections in each area were also grouped by zone. In this
            analysis, gas deliverability from the Montney formation is separate
            from the other tight gas sources.

          <p>
            Within each Petrocube area and zone, gas connections were grouped by
            connection year, with all connections made prior to 1999 forming a
            single grouping, and separate groupings for each year from 1999
            through 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            CBM connections were grouped primarily by zone into three
            categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Horseshoe Canyon Main Play</li>
            <li>Mannville CBM, and</li>
            <li>Other CBM</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the projection period, CBM production is only in Alberta.</p>
          <p>
            Within each of the three categories of CBM resources, connections
            were also grouped by connection year. For the Horseshoe Canyon Main
            Play and Other CBM categories, there is a single grouping for all
            connections made prior to 2004, and separate groupings for each year
            from 2004 through 2014. For Mannville CBM, a single grouping was
            made for all connections made prior to 2006, and separate groupings
            for each following year.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Existing Connections vs. Future Connections</strong></p>
          <p>
            In this report, “existing connections” are connections brought on
            production prior to August&nbsp;1, 2015, and “future connections”
            are connections brought on production from August 1, 2015 onwards.
            The methodology applied to make the gas deliverability projections
            for existing connections is substantially different from what is
            done to assess deliverability for future connections.
          </p>
          <h6 id="sa1112">A1.1.1.2 Methodology for Existing Connections</h6>
          <p>
            For <strong>existing connections</strong>, production decline
            analysis on historical production data is done on each grouping (gas
            type/study area/zone/connection year) to develop two sets of
            parameters.

              Average connection deliverability parameters &ndash; describing
              deliverability expectations for the average gas connection in the
              grouping (note—these only apply when the grouping represents a
              specific connection year).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The methodology for the production decline analysis on existing
            connections is described below. The group deliverability parameters
            and average connection deliverability parameters resulting from this
            analysis are contained in <a href="#sa3">Appendix&nbsp;A.3</a> and
            <a href="#sa4">Appendix&nbsp;A.4</a>, respectively. In the
            deliverability model, the group deliverability parameters are used
            to make the deliverability projection for existing connections.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Production Decline Analysis Methodology</strong></p>
          <p>
            The production decline analysis procedure described below applies to
            conventional gas connections (including tight gas), CBM and shale
            gas in the WCSB.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conventional and shale gas connections are grouped by study area,
            zone, and connection year. CBM connections in Alberta are grouped by
            producing zone and connection year. For each of these groupings, a
            data set of group marketable production history is created and,
            where the grouping represents a specific connection year, a data set
            of average connection marketable production history is also
            generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data sets for group marketable production are generated as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Raw well production for gas connections in each grouping is summed
              by calendar month getting total group raw production by calendar
              month.
            </li>
            <li>
              The total group raw production by calendar month is multiplied by
              an average shrinkage factor that applies to the grouping and
              divided by the number of days in each month to get total monthly
              marketable gas production and marketable gas production rate
              (MMcf/d) for each calendar month.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using this data set, plots of total daily marketable production
              rate versus total cumulative marketable production are generated
              for each grouping.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The data sets for average connection production history are created
            as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The raw well production by month for each connection in the
              grouping is put in a data base.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each entry of production month for each connection, a value of
              normalized production month is calculated as the number of months
              between the month the connection began producing and the actual
              production month (this is the normalized production month).
            </li>
            <li>
              The raw production for connections in the grouping is summed by
              normalized production month and then multiplied by the average
              shrinkage factor that applies to the grouping, providing total
              marketable production by normalized production month.
            </li>
            <li>
              The total marketable production by normalized production month is
              then divided by the total number of connections in the grouping to
              get marketable production for the average connection by normalized
              production month.
            </li>
            <li>
              The marketable production for normalized production month is then
              divided by the average number of days in a month, or 30.4375,
              giving the production rate for the average connection in the
              grouping by normalized production month. (Note: due to the
              different number of production months for connections in the
              grouping coming on stream at different times of the year, some
              production data could not be used in the calculation of the
              average connection production rate).
            </li>
            <li>
              Using this data set, plots of daily marketable production rate
              versus cumulative marketable production for the average connection
              were generated for each grouping.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For conventional gas connections, the following procedures are
            applied in performing production decline analysis using the group
            and average connection historical production data sets:

                    all study areas, a stable exponential decline for the past
                    several years was exhibited. The group plot for all the
                    connections prior to 1998 yields a current marketable
                    production rate, a stable decline rate applicable to future
                    production, and a terminal decline that may be applicable to
                    later connection year groupings for the study area.

                            For the earlier connection years, the available data
                            is usually sufficient to establish all of the above
                            parameters. For more recent connection years, the
                            duration of historical production data becomes
                            shorter and the parameters describing the later life
                            decline performance must be taken from that
                            determined for earlier connection years. In the
                            example shown in
                            <a href="#fa13">Figure&nbsp;A1.3</a>, the available
                            data is sufficient to determine parameters defining
                            the first, second, and third decline periods for the
                            connection, but the parameters defining the fourth
                            decline period must be assumed based on the analysis
                            of earlier connection years.

                            It is assumed that, unless the historical data for
                            the connection year indicates otherwise, the fourth
                            decline rate will equal the terminal decline rate
                            for the grouping established through evaluation of
                            all pre-1999 connections, and that period of the
                            terminal decline rate will commence after 120 months
                            of production.

                        Production Decline Analysis for the Group Data:
                        <p>
                          Once the performance parameters for the average
                          connection are established, the procedure focuses on
                          evaluation of group performance parameters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          As a first step, the average connection performance
                          parameters are combined with the known connection
                          schedule to calculate the expected group performance.
                          This is plotted with the actual group performance
                          data. If the data calculated from average connection
                          performance data does not provide a good match with
                          the actual historical production data for the group,
                          then the average connection parameters may be revised
                          until a good match is obtained between calculated
                          group production data (from average connection data)
                          and actual group production data. An example of the

                          In the earlier connection year groupings (2001, 2002,
                          etc.), the actual group data is usually stabilized by
                          the current date at or near the terminal decline rate
                          established via the pre-1999 aggregate grouping. In
                          these cases a single decline rate sufficiently
                          describes the entire remaining productive life of the
                          grouping. In these cases the expected performance
                          calculated from average connection data has little

            <strong>Production Decline Analysis of CBM and Shale Gas</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The production decline analysis procedure described above is also
            applied to the CBM groupings and shale gas, subject to the
            following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Mannville CBM connections have a different performance profile
              than the other gas resources in the WCSB. While gas connections
              for all other groupings can be described by an initial production
              rate that declines in a relatively predictable manner, Mannville
              CBM connections go through a dewatering phase with gas production
              increasing over a period of months to a peak rate. After the peak
              rate is reached decline will occur. Thus a slightly different set
              of parameters is used to describe performance of the average
              connection for Mannville CBM, with initial production rate being
              replaced by “Months to Peak Production” and “Peak Production
              Rate”.
            </li>
            <li>
              The shorter production history of shale gas makes it more
              difficult to establish long term decline rates based on historical
              data. Nevertheless, decline rates that describe the full
              productive life of shale gas connections are still estimated in
              this Energy Market Assessment, based on the NEB’s view of ultimate
              gas recovery for the average connection.

          <h6 id="sa1113">A1.1.1.3 Methodology for Future Connections</h6>
          <p>
            For future connections, deliverability is projected based on the
            number of future connections and the expected average performance
            characteristics of those connections. The drilling projection is
            used to estimate the number of future gas connections. Historical
            trends in average connection performance parameters, obtained from
            production decline analysis of existing gas connections, are used to
            estimate average connection performance parameters for future
            connection years.
          </p>
          <h6 id="sa11131">A1.1.1.3.1 Performance of Future Connections</h6>
          <p>
            The performance of future connections is obtained in each resource
            grouping by extrapolating the production performance trends for
            average connections in past connection years. The performance
            parameters estimated are initial productivity of the average
            connection and the associated decline rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many groupings, each new connection year follows a trend of
            decreasing initial productivity for the average conventional gas
            connection. This trend is evident in
            <a href="#fa15">Figure&nbsp;A1.5</a>, which shows the initial
            production rate over time for conventional gas connections in the
            West Central Alberta Tertiary conventional grouping. Recently,
            however, there has been a trend in some tight and shale groupings
            where initial productivity for the average gas connection has been
            increasing. The initial production rate for future gas connections
            is estimated by extrapolating the trend in each resource grouping.
            Historical and projected initial productivity values for the average
            connection for all gas resource groupings are contained in

            The Board projects an allocation of gas-intent drill days for each
            of the resource groupings. The allocation fractions are determined
            from historical trends, recent estimates of supply costs, and the
            Board’s view of development potential for the resource groupings.
            The allocation fractions reflect the historical trends of an
            increasing focus on the deeper formations located in the western
            side of the basin, increasing interest in tight gas and gas shales
            in B.C, and further development of liquids rich/wet natural gas.
            Tables of the historical data (drill days and allocation fractions)
            and the projected allocation fractions are available in

            After allocating the gas-intent drill days to the resource
            groupings, a check is completed against drilling capacity to ensure
            that physical drilling limitations are not exceeded. The number of
            gas-intent wells drilled in each year is calculated by dividing the
            drill days targeting each resource grouping by the applicable
            average number of drill days per well.

            For each resource grouping, a connection ratio (the ratio of annual
            connections to annual wells drilled targeting a grouping) is
            estimated based on historical data. The annual number of wells
            drilled is multiplied by the connection ratio to obtain the number
            of annual connections for each resource grouping. The connection
            ratios for each resource grouping are provided in

          <h5 id="sa112">A1.1.2 Solution Gas</h5>
          <p>
            Solution gas is gas produced from oil wells in conjunction with the
            crude oil and accounts for about 13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total
            marketable gas production in the WCSB. To estimate deliverability of
            solution gas, oil connections are grouped by study area and
            production decline analysis is performed on the entire grouping to
            obtain the current production rate and the decline rate. The
            deliverability resulting from these parameters is deemed to
            represent all solution gas deliverability (i.e. deliverability from
            both existing and future connections).
          </p>
          <h5 id="sa113">A1.1.3 Yukon and Northwest Territories</h5>
          <p>
            No deliverability from the Mackenzie Delta and elsewhere along the
            Mackenzie Corridor is included during the three year projection
            period, as lower prices have rendered production uneconomic. The
            Norman Wells field produces small amounts of gas that serve local
            purposes and is not tied into the North American pipeline grid.
            Cameron Hills production ceased in February 2015.

            For producing wells from offshore Nova Scotia, production profiles
            are based on the seasonal performance of the two producing projects.
            No additional infill wells are assumed for the producing fields over
            the projection period. Deliverability from the Deep Panuke
            development started in fall 2013, but has since turned seasonal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Onshore production from the McCully Field in New Brunswick was
            connected into the regional pipeline system at the end of June 2007
            and now operates on a seasonal basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shale gas potential exists in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia,
            however, provincial policies currently prohibit hydraulic fracturing
            which is required for shale gas development. It is assumed these
            policies do not change over the projection period.
          </p>
          <h4 id="sa13">A1.3 Other Canadian Production</h4>
          <p>
            A minor remaining amount of Canadian deliverability is from Ontario.
            Deliverability from Ontario is projected by extrapolation of
            historical production volumes. Shale gas potential exists in Quebec,
            however, provincial policies currently prohibit hydraulic fracturing
            which is required for shale gas development. It is assumed these
            policies do not change over the projection period.
          </p>
          <h4 id="sa14">A1.4 Canadian Deliverability and Canadian Demand</h4>
          <p>
            Canadian natural gas demand is met within the integrated North
            American natural gas market by a combination of Canadian natural gas
            deliverability and imports of U.S. gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Natural gas deliverability is defined as the estimated amount of gas
            supply that could be produced from a given area, after field
            processing, based on historical production and individual well
            declines, as well as projected activity. All estimated gas use prior
            to the outlet from field processing plants has already been deducted
            from the deliverability estimate, and likewise is not included in
            the demand estimate. Gas consumed at the Goldboro processing
            facility in Nova Scotia is in this category of field processing and
            has therefore already been deducted from Atlantic Canada
            deliverability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current and projected Canadian gas demand is divided geographically
            at the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border into Western and Eastern Canada
            demand. Western Canada demand includes gas volumes withdrawn during
            the recovery of natural gas liquids at straddle plants.
            Approximately 85 to 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the gas volumes leaving
            Alberta are processed through the straddle plants, where much of the
            ethane in the gas stream is extracted along with traces of other
            NGLs and heavier components remaining after field processing. A
            table of the Average Annual Canadian Deliverability and Demand is
            available in <a href="#se">Appendix&nbsp;E</a>.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Canadian gas demand includes gas required for pipeline fuel in the
            respective areas. The Board’s projection of Canadian gas demand is
            based on historical trends and expected major increments of
            gas-fired power generation and industrial projects (including oil
            sands developments). The demand projection is based on the
            assumption of average weather conditions. Considerable variability
            in actual gas demand is possible due to the impact of weather
            variation on Canada’s space heating needs.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sa2">A2 &ndash; DELIVERABILITY PARAMETERS &ndash; RESULTS</h3>
          <h4 id="sa21">A2.1 WCSB</h4>
          <p>
            Using the Board’s methodology, connections in the WCSB are
            categorized as either gas or oil. Gas connections are further
            categorized as conventional (including the tight gas sub-category),
            and unconventional (including shale gas and CBM). Connections are
            grouped based on geographical area, producing zone, and connection
            year, with different grouping criteria applied to different types of
            connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of existing gas connections (those on production prior
            to 1&nbsp;August 2015), and all oil connections (solution gas),
            production decline analysis is used to establish parameters that
            define future deliverability of each grouping.
            <a href="#sa211">Section&nbsp;A2.1.1</a> below provides further
            discussion of the parameters resulting from the production decline
            analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            For future gas connections (those on production after 1&nbsp;August
            2015), the number of expected future connections and the expected
            production performance of those future connections is estimated to
            provide a basis for the deliverability projection.
            <a href="#sa212">Section&nbsp;A2.1.2</a> below provides discussion
            of the parameters used to project deliverability for future gas
            connections.
          </p>
          <h5 id="sa211">A2.1.1 Production from Existing Gas Connections</h5>
          <p>
            The future deliverability of existing connections of the resource
            groupings comprising conventional (including tight gas), and
            unconventional (including shale gas and CBM), and all solution gas
            was determined via the production decline analysis procedure
            described in <a href="#sa3">Appendix&nbsp;A3</a>. The decline
            parameters describing the expected future deliverability of each
            grouping are listed in <a href="#sa3">Appendix&nbsp;A3</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deliverability parameters for these groupings
            <strong><em>are not</em></strong> impacted by the different price
            cases considered in this report. The different price cases are
            included to reflect uncertainty in future gas drilling activity
            only.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parameters describing future deliverability for all of these
            groupings are the production rate as of July 2015 and as many as
            four future decline rates that apply to specified time periods in
            the future. For the older groupings of wells where production
            appears to have stabilized at a final decline rate, only one future
            decline rate is needed to describe future group deliverability. For
            newer well groupings, the decline rate that applies over future
            months changes as the group performance progresses towards the final
            stable decline period. For these newer well groupings, three or
            possibly four different decline rates have been determined to
            describe future performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The future deliverability projected for these groupings represents
            the deliverability that would occur from the WCSB if there were no
            further gas connections made after July 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board’s projections show that aggregate production for these
            groupings will decline by 10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per year over 2015
            to 2018. Deliverability from future gas connections supplements the
            declining deliverability from existing connections.
          </p>
          <h5 id="sa212">A2.1.2 Future Gas Connections</h5>
          <p>
            Deliverability associated with future gas connections is calculated
            for each resource grouping using estimates for production
            performance of the average connection and the number of connections
            in future years. The parameters associated with both of these inputs
            are discussed in the sections below.
          </p>
          <p>
            While past deliverability projections for existing gas connections
            have enjoyed a high degree of accuracy, the certainty associated
            with the projections for future gas connections is less. The key
            uncertainty is the level of gas drilling that will occur. Three
            price cases have been created to address the uncertainty inherent in
            the gas drilling projections.

          <p>
            The production decline analysis procedures described in
            <a href="#sa1">Appendix&nbsp;A.1</a> provide the basis for
            establishing performance parameters for future gas connections. The
            trends seen in average connection performance for the various

            performance parameters for future gas connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            For conventional gas connections (including tight gas), the
            connections are grouped based on area, formation, and connection
            year from 1999 through 2015. These 13&nbsp;connection year groupings
            are assessed for each grouping, providing an excellent historical
            data set to estimate performance of future wells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two trends are apparent in the performance parameters for the
            existing conventional gas connections.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Decline rates applicable to the average connection are quite
              stable over the past several connection years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Initial productivity of the average connection increases from

          <p>
            With respect to initial productivity of the average gas connection,
            the overall trend for the WCSB is shown in
            <a href="#fa21">Figure&nbsp;A2.1</a>. After decreases in initial
            productivity over 2001 to 2006, the trend reversed upward for 2007,
            remained fairly stable through 2009, and continued upward through to
            2015 as higher initial productivity rates from tight gas and shale
            gas wells began to represent a growing share of the wells drilled in
            a year. Initial productivity over the projection is almost flat
            primarily due to holding the rates constant for most gas wells.

            The average connection performance parameters projected for
            connection years August 2015 through 2018 are the same in all three
            price cases assessed in this report. Variance between the cases is
            affected by applying different levels of gas drilling activity as
            discussed further in <a href="#sa2122">Section&nbsp;A2.1.2.2</a> of

          <h6 id="sa2122">A2.1.2.2 Number of Future Gas Connections</h6>
          <p>
            The projected number of connections by year and the projected
            production performance of the average connections in those years are
            applied to provide deliverability associated with future gas
            connections. To determine the number of future gas connections,
            projections of gas-intent drilling are made for each of the resource
            groupings. The annual number of wells targeted to each grouping is
            applied to the ratio of annual connections to annual wells for that
            grouping to provide the annual number of connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Volatile and unpredictable market conditions are expected to be the
            primary influence on gas-intent drilling activity. As a result,
            there is a high degree of uncertainty in the gas drilling activity
            that might occur in the coming years. Three drilling activity cases

          <p>
            As indicated in <a href="#sa1">Appendix&nbsp;A1</a>, deliverability
            from Atlantic Canada and Ontario is based on extrapolation of prior
            trends. No additional wells over the 2016 to 2018 period are assumed
            to be drilled that would contribute to deliverability at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketable production from the Deep Panuke development started in
            fall 2013. Deep Panuke has begun producing seasonally in the
            winters, however incursion of water into the reservoir could
            adversely impact the amount of natural gas recoverable over the
            lifetime of the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provincial policy in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia currently
            prohibits hydraulic fracturing which is required for shale gas
            development. It is assumed that these policies do not change and no
            additional onshore gas wells are drilled over the projection period.
            Deliverability from Ontario continues to decline with no additional
            drilling expected over the projection period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provincial policy in Quebec currently prohibits hydraulic fracturing
            which is required for shale gas development. It is assumed that
            these policies do not change and no additional gas wells are drilled
            over the projection period.

            industry. Its purpose is to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and efficient energy infrastructure and
            markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set by
            Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy development and
            trade. The Board's main responsibilities include regulating the
            construction and operation of interprovincial and international oil
            and gas pipelines as well as international and designated
            interprovincial power lines. The Board regulates pipeline tolls and
            tariffs for pipelines under its jurisdiction. In terms of specific
            energy commodities, the Board regulates the exports and imports of
            natural gas as well as exports of oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs)
            and electricity. Additionally, the Board regulates oil and gas
            exploration, development and production in Frontier lands and
            offshore areas not covered by provincial or federal management

          <h2 id="s2">Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            In a relatively new development over just the past few years, shale
            formations are being targeted for natural gas production. Based on
            initial results, there may be significant potential for shale gas
            production in various regions of Canada, including traditional areas
            of conventional production like Alberta, British Columbia, and
            Saskatchewan, and non-traditional areas like Quebec, Nova Scotia,
            and New Brunswick. However, there is much uncertainty because most
            Canadian shale gas production is currently in experimental or early
            developmental stages. Thus, its full potential will not be known for
            some time. If exploitation proves to be successful, Canadian shale
            gas may partially offset projected long-term declines in Canadian
            conventional natural gas production.
          </p>
          <p>
            This emerging resource can be considered a technology driven play as
            achieving gas production out of otherwise unproductive rock requires
            technology-intensive processes. Maximizing gas recoveries requires
            far more wells than would be the case in conventional natural gas
            operations. Furthermore, horizontal wells with horizontal legs up to
            two&nbsp;kilometres in length are widely used to access the
            reservoir to the greatest extent possible. Multi-stage hydraulic
            fracturing, where the shale is cracked under high pressures at
            several places along the horizontal section of the well, is used to
            create conduits through which gas can flow. Micro-seismic imaging
            allows operators to visualize where this fracture growth is
            occurring in the reservoir. However, as a technology driven play,
            the rate of development of shale gas may become limited by the
            availability of required resources, such as fresh water, fracture
            proppant, or drilling rigs capable of drilling wells several
            kilometres in length.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are some environmental concerns with the specialized
            techniques used to exploit shale gas. There is potential for a heavy
            draw on freshwater resources because of the large quantities
            required for hydraulic fracturing fluid. The land-use footprint of
            shale gas development is not expected to be much more than the
            footprint of conventional operations, despite higher well densities,
            because advances in horizontal drilling technology allow for up to
            ten or more wells to be drilled and produced from the same wellsite.
            Finally, there is potential for a high carbon footprint through
            emissions of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), a natural impurity in
            some shale gas. Proposals have been made for carbon capture and
            storage as a remedy.

          <h2 id="s3">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Canadian production of conventional natural gas is declining and is
            expected to continue declining over the next few years.<sup
              >[1]</sup
            >
            In response, industry has been shifting its exploration focus
            towards unconventional natural gas (i.e.&nbsp;natural gas that can
            be produced from non-traditional, low permeability<sup>[2]</sup>
            reservoirs such as shales or coals). Many also include tight gas
            within the unconventional category, such as from low permeability
            sandstones, limestones, or dolostones. Development of these
            unconventional resources is technologically challenging. The
            principal Canadian shale gas plays are the Horn River Basin and
            Montney shales in northeast British Columbia, the Colorado Group of
            Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Utica Shale of Quebec, and the Horton
            Bluff Shale of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

          <h2 id="s4">What is Shale?</h2>
          <p>
            Shale is a sedimentary rock that was once deposited as mud (clay and
            silt) and is generally a combination of clay, silica (e.g. quartz),
            carbonate (calcite or dolomite), and organic material.<sup>[3]</sup>
            While shales are generally thought of as being clay rich, the
            proportions of the constituents can be quite variable. Shale may
            also have thin beds or laminae<sup>[4]</sup> of sandstone,
            limestone, or dolostone (Figure&nbsp;2). The mud was deposited in
            deep, quiet water such as in large lakes or deep seas and oceans.
            The organic matter in the mud was algae, plant matter, or plankton
            that died and sank to the sea floor or lake bed before being buried.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            [3] A technical definition of shale can be considered, &quot;A
            fissile, terrigenous sedimentary rock in which particles are mostly
            of silt and clay size.&quot; Fissile refers to the rock's ability to
            split into thin sheets along bedding while terrigenous refers to the
            sediment's origins, that it is the product of weathering of rocks.

          <h2 id="s5">Petroleum History</h2>
          <p>
            While only attracting significant attention over the past few years,
            natural gas<sup>[5]</sup> has been produced from shale formations in
            the Appalachian Mountains of the United States since the late 1800s.
            The initial oil discovery at Norman Wells in Canada's Northwest
            Territories in&nbsp;1920 flowed oil from fractured shale deposits
            that were later found to be connected to the underlying conventional
            oil pool. In southeast Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan, gas has
            been produced from the Second White Speckled Shale for decades.
            Another example is the Antrim Shale in the Michigan Basin, which has
            produced shale gas since the late 1940s. In all of these early
            cases, there was sufficient natural fracturing of the shale to allow
            economic recovery typically through shallow vertical wells producing
            at low rates over a long time.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            [5] The term &quot;natural gas&quot; refers to methane and ethane
            directly produced from geological reservoirs. Before natural gas was
            collected from wells, methane came from &quot;manufactured
            gas,&quot; which was created during high-temperature processing of
            coal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recent experience shows that, even in areas with less natural
            fracturing, shale gas can still be turned into a prolific resource.
            A typical Barnett Shale well from Texas flows 85&nbsp;000 to
            140&nbsp;000&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;metres per day (m&sup3;/d), or 3 to
            5&nbsp;million&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;feet per day (MMcf/d), on startup. In
            comparison, the average Canadian conventional natural gas well
            drilled and put on production in&nbsp;2007 had initial production of
            approximately 5&nbsp;700&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (0.2&nbsp;MMcf/d).<sup
              >[6]</sup
            >
            Production from the Barnett Shale as a whole is expected to peak
            somewhere around 140&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (5&nbsp;Bcf/d)<sup
              >[7]</sup

            As mud turns into shale during shallow burial, generally just a few
            hundred&nbsp;metres deep, in the &quot;nursery&quot;, bacteria feed
            on the available organic matter (up to 10&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent of the
            rock volume but generally less than five&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent) and
            release biogenic methane as a byproduct (Figure&nbsp;3).<sup
              >[9]</sup
            >
            Natural gas is also generated during deep burial while the shale is
            in the &quot;kitchen&quot;, generally several kilometres deep, where
            heat and pressure crack the organic matter, including any oil
            already produced by the same heat and pressure, into smaller
            hydrocarbons, creating thermogenic methane (Figure&nbsp;3). Some of
            the oil and gas manages to escape and migrate into the more porous
            rock of conventional reservoirs. In fact, the vast bulk of the
            world's conventional reserves of oil and gas were generated in and
            escaped from organic-rich shales. But some oil and gas does not
            escape, as it is either trapped in the micropore spaces or attached
            to the organic matter within the shale.

            For example, the natural gas produced from the Second White Specks
            Shale of Alberta and Saskatchewan comes from shallow burial (it is
            shallow enough that gas is still being generated by bacteria), while
            the natural gas from the Devonian Horn River Basin and Triassic
            Montney shales was generated during deep burial. The Utica Shale of
            Quebec has both shallow and deep sections and there is potential for
            both biogenic and thermogenic natural gas, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The origins of natural gas become important when evaluating
            shale-gas prospects. For example, thermogenic systems often produce
            natural gas liquids<sup>[10]</sup> with the methane, which can add
            value to production, whereas biogenic systems generate methane only.
            Thermogenic systems can also lead to the generation of carbon
            dioxide as an impurity in the natural gas, which costs money to
            remove and can increase greenhouse-gas emissions. Thermogenic plays
            tend to flow at high rates, but are normally exploited through the
            extensive use of horizontal drilling and are therefore more
            expensive to develop than biogenic plays, which flow at lower rates
            and are exploited through shallow, closely spaced vertical wells
            instead.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            [10] Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are hydrocarbons heavier than
            methane, like propane, butane, and pentane, that are commonly
            associated with natural gas production.

          <h2 id="s7">Shales as Reservoirs</h2>
          <p>
            In conventional reservoirs, oil and gas are fairly mobile and easily
            move through the permeable formation because of buoyancy (they are
            lighter than the water in the same formation and therefore rise)
            until they are trapped against an impermeable rock (i.e. a seal)
            that prevents further movement. This leads to localized pools of oil
            and gas while the rest of the formation is filled with water. The
            average natural gas pool in Alberta has
            169&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3; (6.0&nbsp;Bcf) of gas in place spread
            over an average of 5.3&nbsp;square&nbsp;kilometres.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, shale gas, both biogenic and thermogenic, remains where it
            was first generated and can be found in three forms: 1)&nbsp;free
            gas in the pore spaces and fractures; 2)&nbsp;adsorbed gas, where
            the gas is electrically stuck to the organic matter and clay; and
            3)&nbsp;a small amount of dissolved gas that is dissolved in the
            organic matter. Because typical shales are a few dozen to hundreds
            of metres (even a few kilometres) thick and extend over very wide
            geographic areas, gas shales are often referred to as resource
            plays, where natural gas resources are widely distributed over
            extensive areas rather than concentrated in specific locations. The
            volume of natural gas contained within a resource play increases as
            the thickness and areal extent of the deposit grows. Individual gas
            shales appear to have hundreds to thousands of
            billion&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;metres (tens to hundreds of&nbsp;Tcf) of gas
            in place spread over hundreds to thousands of square kilometres. The
            difficulty lies in extracting even a small fraction of that gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pore spaces in shale, through which the natural gas must move if
            the gas is to flow into any well, are 1000&nbsp;times smaller than
            pores in conventional sandstone reservoirs. The gaps that connect
            pores (the pore throats) are smaller still, only 20 times larger
            than a single methane molecule.<sup>[11]</sup> Therefore, shale has
            very low permeability. However, fractures, which act like conduits
            for the movements for natural gas, may naturally exist in the shale
            and increase its permeability.

            There are also hybrid gas shales, where the originally deposited mud
            was rich in sand or silt, therefore having naturally higher
            permeability and greater susceptibility to hydraulic fracturing (see
            below). Examples include the Triassic Montney Formation and the
            Cretaceous Second White Speckled Shale. The Montney is so rich in
            silt and sand that it is often referred to as tight gas, as it has
            been in many NEB publications. However, unlike typical tight-gas
            plays, the natural gas in the Montney is sourced from its own
            organic matter, more typical of shale gas. Importantly, there is no
            universal definition of shale gas that is shared by various
            regulatory bodies. For simplicity, the Montney will be referred to
            as shale gas in this briefing note.

          <h2 id="s8">Drilling and Completing Shale Gas Wells</h2>
          <p>
            Natural gas will not readily flow to any vertical well drilled
            through it because of the low permeability of shales. This can be
            overcome to some extent by drilling horizontal wells, where the
            drillbit is steered from its downward trajectory to follow a
            horizontal trajectory for one to two&nbsp;kilometres, thereby
            exposing the wellbore to as much reservoir as possible
            (Figure&nbsp;5). By drilling horizontally, the wellbore may
            intersect a greater number of naturally existing fractures in the
            reservoir - the direction of the drill path is chosen based on the
            known fracture trends in each area. However, some shales can only be
            drilled with vertical wells because of the risk of the borehole
            collapsing (e.g. the Cretaceous Second White Speckled Shale of
            Alberta and Saskatchewan). The trade-off between drilling horizontal
            versus vertical is increased access to the reservoir, but at a far
            higher cost.

          <p>
            Hydraulic fracturing (commonly referred to as &quot;fraccing&quot;,
            &quot;fracking&quot;, or &quot;fracing&quot;) is already widely used
            by the oil and gas industry to improve low permeability reservoirs.
            Fluid (often water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, or propane) is
            pumped down the well until the pressure surpasses the rock strength
            and causes the reservoir to crack (Figure&nbsp;5). The
            &quot;frac&quot; fluid pumped down the well is loaded with proppant
            (often 100 tonnes or more of ceramic beads or sand) that infiltrate
            the formation and help to prop the fractures open, which are at risk
            of closing once the pressure is released. The choice of the fluid
            used in a frac depends on many factors, including whether clay in
            the reservoir is sensitive to water (some clays swell in the
            presence of fresh water, such as in the Colorado Shale) or whether
            the reservoir happens to respond better to particular fluids,
            usually only determined through experimentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two factors increase the ability of shale to fracture. One is the
            presence of hard minerals like silica (and to a lesser extent
            calcite), which break like glass. Clay, however, tends to absorb
            more of the pressure and often bends under applied hydraulic
            pressure without breaking. Therefore, silica-rich shales like those
            found in the Horn River Basin are excellent candidates for fraccing.
            The other factor is the shale's internal pressure. Overpressured
            shales develop during the generation of natural gas: because of the
            low permeability, much of the gas cannot escape and builds in place,
            increasing the internal pressure of the rock. Therefore, the
            artificially created fracture network can penetrate further into the
            formation because the shale is already closer to the breaking point
            than in normally pressured shales. The Horn River, Montney, and
            Utica shales are all considered to be overpressured. The Colorado
            Shale is underpressured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, by isolating sections along the horizontal portion of
            the well, segments of the borehole can be fracced one at a time in a
            technique called multi-stage fraccing (Figure&nbsp;5). By listening
            at the surface and in neighbouring wells, it can be determined how
            far, how extensively, and in what directions the shale has cracked
            from the induced pressure (Figure&nbsp;6). Finally, shales can be
            re-fracced years later, after production has declined. This may
            allow the well to access more of the reservoir that may have been
            missed during the initial hydraulic fracturing or to re-open
            fractures that may have closed due to the decrease in pressure as
            the reservoir was drained.

            Even with hydraulic fracturing, wells drilled into low-permeability
            reservoirs have difficulty &quot;communicating&quot; far into the
            formation. As a result, additional wells must be drilled to access
            as much gas as possible, typically three or four, but up to eight,
            horizontal wells per section<sup>[12]</sup>. In comparison, only one
            well per section is typically drilled for conventional natural gas
            reservoirs in western Canada. However, this does not necessarily
            mean that there will be a heavier land use footprint versus
            conventional drilling. Several shale gas wells with horizontal
            lengths of up to two&nbsp;kilometres can be drilled from a single
            site one hectare in size, reducing the footprint to one well site or
            less per section (Figure&nbsp;7).

            In conventional reservoirs, as much as 95&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent of the
            natural gas can be recovered. For shales, recoveries are expected to
            be around 20&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent because of low permeabilities
            despite high-density horizontal drilling and extensive hydraulic
            fracturing. However, it appears that some places in the Barnett
            Shale of Texas may exceed expectations and might achieve 50&nbsp;
            per&nbsp;cent rates of recovery.<sup>[13]</sup> In Canada, total
            volumes of recoverable gas in each horizontal shale gas well are
            expected to be from 30&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3; to
            280&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3; (1&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;Bcf), but could
            grow as improvements in technology increase recoveries. Rates of
            production from horizontal wells are initially high, generally
            85&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d to 450&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (3
            to&nbsp;16&nbsp;MMcf/d), although they rapidly decline during the
            first year before setting into a long period of lower rates

            than a decade. In vertical shale gas wells, flow rates are much

            Drilling and hydraulically fracturing wells can be water-intensive
            procedures; however, there is very limited Canadian experience from
            which to estimate potential environmental impacts. In the American
            experience, where water is extensively used in hydraulic fracturing,
            each well in the Barnett Shale of the Fort Worth Basin in Texas
            requires an estimated 11&nbsp;million litres (3&nbsp;million US
            gallons) of fresh water. Initial reports from Canadian operators
            working on Canadian shales indicate some similarities. However,
            water is not necessarily required for all hydraulic fracturing in
            gas shales. For example, many fracs in the Montney play use CO<sub
              >2</sub
            >
            as the frac fluid. Furthermore, water is not a good candidate for
            use as a frac fluid for the shallow shales of the Colorado Group of
            southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan because of their
            sensitivity to water. Operators there appear to be using nitrogen or
            a mixture of propane and butane as the frac fluid instead.
            Currently, it is too early to draw conclusions on the impact of
            shale gas development on the use of fresh water resources in Canada;
            however, along with the availability of fracture proppant and
            specialized drilling rigs able to drill wells several kilometres in
            length, it may be a constraint on the pace of Canadian shale gas
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frac water often contains chemical additives to help carry the
            proppant and may become enriched in salts after being injected into
            shale formations. Therefore, frac water that is recovered during
            natural gas production must be either treated or disposed of in a
            safe manner. Frac water is typically disposed of by injection into
            deep, highly saline formations through one or more wells drilled
            specifically for that purpose. The practice is commonplace in
            western Canada, where wells often produce water in conjunction with
            conventional oil and natural gas, and is governed by clearly defined
            regulations. Flow-back water is infrequently reused in other fracs
            because of the potential for corrosion or scaling, where the
            dissolved salts may precipitate out of the water and clog parts of
            the well or the formation. Pilot projects for treatment of flow-back
            water from the Barnett Shale include distillation, where the
            distilled water can then be reused in other fracs to reduce
            requirements for fresh water. Importantly, operators avoid releasing
            the recovered frac water into the watershed. Furthermore, the
            fracced reservoir is normally two or more kilometres at depth and
            the fractures, and frac fluids, cannot extend through such a thick
            section of rock to reach aquifers at shallow depths where drinking
            water is extracted. For shallower shales of southeastern Alberta and
            southwestern Saskatchewan, fracs are of considerably decreased size
            and the soft nature of the shale will likely prevent extensive
            penetration of fractures, which may also have a negative impact on
            ultimate productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the amount of saline formation water produced from gas
            shales varies widely, from none to hundreds of barrels per day. The
            water comes from the gas shale itself or from adjacent formations
            that are connected through the frac-induced fracture network. The
            water, like flow-back water, is normally highly saline and must be
            treated and/or disposed of, typically by injection into deep saline
            formations.

          <h2 id="s9">Well Costs</h2>
          <p>
            Shale gas wells can be very expensive because of the cost of
            horizontal drilling (a function of technology needed to drill
            horizontal and the extra time required to drill) and
            technology-heavy hydraulic fracturing techniques that may take
            several days to fracture a single well. A horizontal well in the
            Montney Formation will typically cost approximately 5 to
            8&nbsp;million&nbsp;dollars. In the Horn River Basin, a horizontal
            well costs up to 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;dollars. Horizontal wells in
            the Utica Shale are expected to cost 5 to
            9&nbsp;million&nbsp;dollars. Vertical wells targeting biogenic shale
            gas, like in the Colorado Shale, are far less expensive: the
            resource is shallow and the wells cost less than $350,000 each.

            <a id="s10"></a>Infrastructure and Relevance to Canadian Production
          </h2>
          <p>
            At this point in time, major shale gas plays in northeast British
            Columbia have inadequate local infrastructure to handle production
            growth beyond the next few years. Spectra Energy currently operates
            a gas-processing plant at Fort Nelson at the south end of the Horn
            River Basin capable of processing up to
            28&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (1.0&nbsp;Bcf/d) of raw gas; however
            its capacity is currently half full from existing gas production.
            Spectra is considering adding an additional
            7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (250&nbsp;MMcf/d) of capacity by
            building a facility 40&nbsp;kilometres northeast of Fort Nelson at
            Cabin Lake. Furthermore, EnCana Corporation has also proposed
            building facilities near Cabin Lake to process an additional
            68&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (2.4&nbsp;Bcf/d) at a cost upwards
            of $2&nbsp;billion.<sup>[15]</sup> In the Montney play area in
            British Columbia, Spectra Energy has recently had a pipeline
            approved by the NEB with capacity of
            6.2&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (220&nbsp;MMcf/d) and is expected
            to be online in the third quarter of&nbsp;2009 at a cost of
            $100&nbsp;million. In the same area, Nova Gas Transmission Limited
            has proposed a pipeline with capacity of
            28&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (1&nbsp;Bcf/d). Importantly,
            development of shale gas could take several years before significant
            production is achieved to warrant construction of large-scale,
            short-haul pipeline capacity. All proposals are subject to
            regulatory approval.

            gas to American or central Canadian markets. Production of natural

            future.<sup>[16]</sup> Whether there is potential for western
            Canadian shale gas to offset these declines was explored in a recent

          <h3>Natural Gas Byproducts and CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</h3>
          <p>
            Most natural gas production requires processing to remove traces of
            other hydrocarbons and impurities from the natural gas stream. The
            recovery of natural gas liquids such as propane, butane, pentanes
            and other condensate is a value-adding process throughout much of
            western Canada. Other trace products such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
            and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) are referred to as acid gas and
            must be removed from the gas stream to prevent corrosion of
            pipelines and equipment for safety reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Horn River Basin shale gas has low levels of natural gas
            liquids, it contains approximately 12&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent
            CO<sub>2</sub>, which originated when the shale was exposed to very
            high temperatures during very deep burial in the gas window,
            converting some of the methane, organic matter, and carbonate
            minerals into CO<sub>2</sub>. This is a significant increase over
            the average two&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent CO<sub>2</sub> content for all
            gas pools in British Columbia and could represent a significant
            addition to B.C.'s, and Canada's, carbon emissions if the CO<sub
              >2</sub
            >
            is vented into the atmosphere. Assuming that the Horn River Basin
            shales reach production levels of 42&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
            (1.5&nbsp;Bcf/d) by&nbsp;2015, approximately
            3.3&nbsp;million&nbsp;metric&nbsp;tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> will be
            produced annually. In comparison, it is equivalent to over half of
            the annual emissions from all Canadian pulp and paper mills as
            of&nbsp;2006 (5.95&nbsp;million&nbsp;metric&nbsp;tonnes). Total
            Canadian production of CO<sub>2</sub> in&nbsp;2006 was
            721&nbsp;million&nbsp;metric&nbsp;tonnes.<sup>[19]</sup>

            The British Columbia government is encouraging a carbon capture and
            sequestration (CCS) strategy for Horn River Basin CO<sub>2</sub>.
            Spectra Energy and EnCana Corporation have proposed building
            sequestration capabilities into their respective existing or
            proposed Horn River Basin gas-processing plants that will have the
            capability to dispose of CO<sub>2</sub> into Devonian-aged
            brine-saturated formations a few thousand&nbsp;metres below the
            surface (Figure&nbsp;9). Furthermore, EnCana has also proposed to
            divert some of the CO<sub>2</sub> for use in enhanced oil recovery
            (EOR) projects in nearby, mature oil pools. While EOR has been
            successfully used to increase oil recoveries in southern
            Saskatchewan at the Weyburn oil field while also storing
            13&nbsp;million&nbsp;tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>,<sup>[20]</sup> there
            are risks, including whether there is the capacity to handle
            injections at any proposed gas-processing site should offsite EOR
            injections go offline. In particular, at this very early stage,
            there are considerable uncertainties of ultimate storage capacity,
            the rates at which CO<sub>2</sub> can be injected, and whether the
            projects can be made economically feasible. Spectra Energy is
            planning on drilling two wells in&nbsp;2009 to test the CCS concept
            at a cost of $12&nbsp;million.<sup>[21]</sup> Should either EnCana's
            or Spectra's projects go ahead, they would be among the largest
            sequestration operations in the world by volume of CO<sub>2</sub>
            stored.

            done a far more extensive preliminary examination of gas shales,
            including many not currently being drilled by exploration
            companies.<sup>[22]</sup> From Table&nbsp;1, it appears that there

            uncertainty in the accuracy of the estimates. How much of that gas

          <h3>Montney Formation</h3>
          <p>
            The Triassic Montney Formation of northeastern British Columbia
            (Figure&nbsp;1) spans a wide variety of depositional environments,
            from shallow-water sands in the east to offshore muds to the west
            (Figure&nbsp;10). Natural gas is currently produced from
            conventional shallow-water shoreface sandstones at the eastern edge
            of the Montney and from deep-water tight sands at the foot of the
            ramp. However, hybrid shale gas potential is being realized in two
            other zones: 1) the Lower Montney, in sandy, silty shales of the
            offshore transition and offshore-marine parts of the basin; and 2)
            the Upper Montney, below the shoreface, where silts have buried the
            tight sands at the foot of the ramp. The Montney is so thick (well
            over 300&nbsp;metres in some places) that some operators are
            planning to pursue stacked horizontal wells, where horizontal legs
            are drilled at two elevations in the same well, penetrating and
            fraccing both the Upper and Lower Montney. Total organic carbon in
            Montney shale is up to seven&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent and the rocks were
            heated until they were well into the thermogenic gas window.

            Estimates of natural gas in the Montney are highly variable,
            from&nbsp;2.3 to 20&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>m&sup3; (80 to 700&nbsp;Tcf)
            of gas in place.<sup>[23]</sup> It should be noted that only a
            fraction of that (approximately 20&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent) is likely to
            be recovered. Furthermore, the Montney estimates do not include the
            overlying Doig Phosphate, which is also considered prospective for
            shale gas. To put this estimate into perspective, the North Slope of
            Alaska has 1.0&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>m&sup3; (35&nbsp;Tcf) of
            discovered recoverable natural gas resources with a high-case
            estimate of 3.9&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>m&sup3; (137&nbsp;Tcf)
            ultimately recoverable resources when potential future discoveries
            are estimated.<sup>[24]</sup>

            Since 2005, production of natural gas from horizontal shale gas
            wells drilled in the Montney has risen from zero to
            10.7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (376&nbsp;MMcf/d) and is expected
            to continue rising (Figure&nbsp;11). As of July&nbsp;2009,
            234&nbsp;horizontal wells were producing from Montney shale,
            dominantly from the Heritage pool of British Columbia. Individual
            wells generally produce 85&nbsp;000 to 141&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d
            (3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;MMcf/d) on startup, but can produce over
            280&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (10&nbsp;MMcf/d), followed by rapid
            declines to long lived lower production rates (Figure&nbsp;8). These
            wells normally have seven to nine, but up to twelve, 100-tonne
            CO<sub>2</sub> or water fracs staged over horizontal legs of
            two&nbsp;kilometres in length.

          <h3>Horn River Basin / Cordova Embayment</h3>
          <p>
            Devonian Horn River Basin shales were deposited in deep waters at
            the foot of the Slave Point carbonate platform in northeast B.C.
            (Figure&nbsp;12), which has been producing conventional natural gas
            for many decades. Horn River Basin shales are silica-rich (around
            55&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent) and approximately 150&nbsp;metres thick.
            Total organic content is one to six&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent. The rocks
            are very mature, having been heated far into the thermogenic gas
            window.<sup>[26]</sup>,<sup>[27]</sup> A commonly used estimate for
            gas in place for the Horn River Basin is
            14&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>m&sup3;
            (500&nbsp;Tcf)<sup>[28]</sup>,<sup>[29]</sup>, of which about
            20&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent is expected to be recoverable.

            Testing is still in the preliminary stage, with about twenty
            horizontal wells drilled, hydraulically fractured, and flowing into
            pipelines. Horn River Basin wells are very prolific and produce up
            to 450&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (16&nbsp;MMcf/d) on startup according
            to several different reports, remembering that production declines
            in shale-gas wells are steep and within just a few months,
            production should be significantly less. Regardless, top Horn River
            Basin shale gas wells will likely rank amongst the most productive
            natural gas wells drilled in western Canada in&nbsp;2009. Currently,
            production data from the Horn River Basin is still confidential and
            estimating total shale-gas production is not possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            EnCana Corporation, who will be one of the major producers of shale
            gas in the Horn River Basin, and Spectra Energy, one of the major
            pipeline operators in northeast B.C., have both proposed
            gas-processing plants to be located near Fort Nelson, B.C.. EnCana's
            facility would be completed in six stages with each stage added as
            new production comes online. The first stage is reported to cost
            $400&nbsp;million and is expected to enter service in&nbsp;2011 with
            the capacity to process 11&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
            (400&nbsp;MMcf/d) of natural gas. The ultimate cost of the project
            could reach $2&nbsp;billion for all six stages and would be capable
            of processing 68&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (2.4&nbsp;Bcf/d).

            The Cordova Embayment is associated with the Horn River Basin
            (Figure&nbsp;12) and also has shale gas potential, although it is at
            a much earlier stage in its evaluation by industry. The Cordova
            Embayment is estimated to have 5.7&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>m&sup3;
            (200&nbsp;Tcf) gas in place. As of May&nbsp;2009, exploration
            companies have spent over $2&nbsp;billion at government auctions to
            acquire resource rights in the Horn River Basin from the British
            Columbia government, while activity has been far less in the Cordova
            Embayment, with less than $40&nbsp;million spent.<sup>[30]</sup> It
            should be noted that the Horn River Basin shale gas play extends
            into both the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories,
            although its northward extent beyond provincial/territorial borders
            is poorly defined.

          <h3>Colorado Group</h3>
          <p>
            The Colorado Group consists of various shaley horizons deposited
            throughout southern Alberta and Saskatchewan (Figure&nbsp;1) during
            globally high sea levels of the middle Cretaceous, including the
            Medicine Hat and Milk River shaley sandstones, which have been
            producing natural gas for over 100 years, and the Second White
            Speckled Shale, which has been producing natural gas for decades. In
            the Wildmere area of Alberta, the Colorado Shale is approximately
            200&nbsp;metres thick, from which natural gas has potential to
            produce from five intervals. Unlike shales from the Horn River Basin
            and the Utica Group of Quebec (see below), shale from the Colorado
            Group produces through thin sand beds and laminae, making it a
            hybrid gas shale like the Montney. Furthermore, the gas produced in
            the Colorado has biogenic rather than thermogenic origins. This
            would suggest very low potential for natural gas liquids and an
            underpressured reservoir, which is more difficult to hydraulically
            fracture. Colorado Group shales are sensitive to water, which makes
            them sensitive to fluids used during hydraulic fracturing. As
            alternatives, operators are pursuing the use of nitrogen or mixtures
            of propane and butane as frac fluid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only vertical wells are planned for the Colorado Shale because of
            poor rock conditions and the risk of caving in the wellbore.
            Currently, more than 85&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (3&nbsp;MMcf/d) is
            being produced out of a few dozen shallow wells in the Wildmere area
            of Alberta, each costing approximately $350,000 full cycle from
            drilling to connection of the well to pipelines.<sup>[31]</sup> The
            total volume of gas in the Colorado Group is very difficult to
            estimate given the wide lateral extent of the shale and variability
            of the reservoir and the absence of independent and publicly
            available analyses. However, there could be at least several
            trillion&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;metres (one&nbsp;hundred&nbsp;Tcf) of gas
            in place.

          <h3>Utica Group</h3>
          <p>
            The Upper Ordovician Utica Shale is located between Montreal and
            Quebec City (Figure&nbsp;13) and was deposited in deep waters at the
            foot of the Trenton carbonate platform. Later, the shale was caught
            up in early Appalachian Mountain growth and became faulted and
            folded on its southeastern side (Figure&nbsp;14). The Utica is
            approximately 150&nbsp;metres thick and has total organic contents
            of one to three&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent and has been known for decades
            as a petroleum source rock for associated conventional reservoirs.
            However, unlike other Canadian gas shales, the Utica has higher
            concentrations of calcite, which occur at the expense of some
            silica.<sup>[32]</sup> While calcite is still brittle, hydraulic
            fractures do not transmit as well through it.

            Biogenic gas can be found in the Utica in shallow areas, while
            thermogenic methane can be found in medium-deep and structured
            shales (Figures 13&nbsp;and&nbsp;14). The reservoir has an advantage
            over others in that it is folded and faulted, which increases the
            potential for the presence of natural fractures (Figure&nbsp;4).
          </p>
          <p>
            Only a handful of wells have been drilled in the Utica, most of them
            vertical. After fraccing, each vertical well is reported to have
            produced approximately 28&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (1&nbsp;MMcf/d) of
            natural gas. Initial results from hydraulic fracturing and flow
            tests from three horizontal wells have yielded stable flow rates of
            2&nbsp;800 to 22&nbsp;700&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (0.1 to 0.8&nbsp;MMcf/d)
            from medium-deep shales, less than expected but likely influenced by
            the lack of equipment to extract frac-water that flowed back during
            production.<sup>[33]</sup>

            Of note, the overlying Lorraine Shale may also be prospective;
            however, it is more clay rich and successful hydraulic fracturing
            may pose a challenge to production. Very recently, a small explorer
            active in the St. Lawrence Lowlands estimated that there was likely
            3.4&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>m&sup3; (120&nbsp;Tcf) of gas in place in
            the Utica Shale in their limited property.<sup>[34]</sup> Otherwise,
            there are no reliable, independent analyses of total gas in place
            for the Utica Shale, let alone the Lorraine Shale.

          <h3>Horton Bluff Group</h3>
          <p>
            Lacustrine muds of the Horton Bluff Group of the Canadian Maritimes
            (Figure&nbsp;1) were deposited in the Early Mississippian (about
            360&nbsp;million years ago) during regional subsidence. The silica
            content in the Frederick Brook Shale of the Horton Bluff Group in
            New Brunswick averages 38&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent; however, the clay
            content is also high, averaging 42&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent.<sup
              >[35]</sup
            >
            Early reports indicate that organic contents of the Frederick Brook
            member in Nova Scotia are significantly higher than other Canadian
            gas shales, at 10&nbsp; per&nbsp;cent, and the pay zone appears to
            be over 150&nbsp;metres thick, sometimes exceeding 1 km in New
            Brunswick.<sup>[36]</sup> Flow testing is underway and, while
            hydraulic fracturing has been less successful than in western
            Canada, two vertical Frederick Brook wells from New Brunswick have
            flowed 4&nbsp;200&nbsp;m&sup3;/d (0.15&nbsp;MMcf/d) after undergoing
            small fracs.

            effective reservoir stimulation to achieve significant production
            from Nova Scotia shales. It is unclear at this time at what

            It appears that there is potential for
            30&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>m&sup3; (1000&nbsp;Tcf) of shale gas in place
            within Canada if not more (Table&nbsp;1). Assuming a 20&nbsp;
            per&nbsp;cent rate of recovery, there would be enough recoverable
            gas to comprise more than one-third of Canada's estimated ultimate
            potential for all conventional natural gas resources or almost two
            thirds of currently remaining ultimate conventional resources.<sup

            High uncertainty, because gas shales are still in the initial stages
            of evaluation across Canada, precludes calculating more rigorous
            resource estimates for Canada at the current time. Furthermore, the
            relative economics of shale gas development also has significant
            uncertainty. The resource will only be developed if it is
            profitable, which means the price of gas derived from other sources,
            like conventional gas, frontier natural gas, and liquefied natural
            gas (LNG), <sup>[42]</sup> will need to be higher than the full
            cycle production cost of shale gas. Currently, only the Montney and
            Horn River Basin gas shales can be said to have &quot;proof of
            concept&quot; through numerous production tests after horizontal
            drilling and hydraulic fracturing and only the Montney currently has
            what can be called significant amounts of production. The Utica
            Shale has only had limited production from three hydraulically
            fractured horizontal wells, making it too early to declare
            &quot;proof of concept&quot;. Production of gas from shallow,
            vertical wells drilled in Colorado Group shales appears to be
            limited to the Wildmere area of Alberta to this point. The Horton
            Bluff Group shales of the Canadian Maritimes are very much in the
            early evaluation and testing stage.

            Shale gas may be a key component of supply that will allow Canada to
            sustain its own domestic requirements for natural gas far into the
            21st Century. Other sources of this natural gas may include other
            resource plays (including coalbed methane, tight sandstones and
            tight carbonates) or future production from Canada's frontier areas
            in the offshore and in the north. It is even possible that shale gas
            could allow Canada to become a net exporter of LNG: recently, Apache
            Corporation and EOG Resources, both active in the Horn River Basin,
            signed memorandums of understanding to supply natural gas to a
            proposed LNG liquefaction terminal in British
            Columbia.<sup>[43]</sup>,<sup>[44]</sup> However, ultimately, the
            pace of development of Canadian shale gas may be constrained by the
            availability of required resources, such as fresh water, fracture
            proppant, or drilling rigs capable of drilling wells several
            kilometres in length.

            Finally, there are some environmental concerns with development of
            shale gas in Canada. Little is known about what the ultimate impact
            on freshwater resources will be. The land-use footprint does not
            appear to be of significant concern beyond conventional operations,
            despite higher well densities, because advances in drilling
            technology allow for ten or more horizontal wells to be drilled from
            the same wellsite. Furthermore, potential growth in CO<sub>2</sub>
            emissions from shale gas is being addressed with proposals for
            carbon capture and sequestration. Still, it is very early to come to
            any conclusions about how development of this potentially large
            resource will impact the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ongoing development of this emerging resource is likely to provide
            additional public data that will enable improved estimates of the
            contribution of shale gas to Canadian natural gas supply. Thus, the
            NEB will continue to monitor its progress.

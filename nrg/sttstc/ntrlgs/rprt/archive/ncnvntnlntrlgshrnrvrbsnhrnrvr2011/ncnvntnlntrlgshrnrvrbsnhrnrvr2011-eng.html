            The B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines (BC MEM, the Ministry) manages
            the responsible exploration and development of British Columbia’s
            energy sector. Part of the Ministry’s mandate is to develop tenure,
            royalty and regulatory policy for British Columbia’s petroleum and
            natural gas industry, thereby ensuring the effective and
            environmentally responsible management of the province’s petroleum
            and natural gas resources. The Ministry provides a range of
            petroleum and natural gas related services including the issuance of
            Crown petroleum and natural gas rights, royalty programs, public
            geosciences, and policies to address potential future resource
            opportunities, such as unconventional petroleum and natural gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is an independent
            federal regulator whose purpose is to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and efficient infrastructure and markets in
            the Canadian public interest<sup>[1]</sup> within the mandate set by
            Parliament for the regulation of pipelines, energy development, and
            trade.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [1] The public interest is inclusive of all Canadians and refers to
            a balance of economic, environmental, and social considerations that
            change as society's values and preferences evolve over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board's main responsibilities include regulating the
            construction and operation of interprovincial and international oil
            and gas pipelines, international power lines, and designated
            interprovincial power lines. Furthermore, the Board regulates the
            tolls and tariffs for the pipelines under its jurisdiction. With
            respect to the specific energy commodities, the Board regulates the
            export of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids and electricity, and
            the import of natural gas. Additionally, the Board regulates oil and
            gas exploration and development on frontier lands and offshore areas
            not covered by provincial or federal management agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also monitors energy markets, and provides its view of the
            reasonable foreseeable requirements for energy use in Canada having
            regard to trends in the discovery of oil and gas.<sup>[2]</sup>The
            Board periodically publishes assessments of Canadian supply and
            demand of energy and natural gas markets in support of its ongoing
            market monitoring. These assessments address various aspects of
            energy markets in Canada.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [2] This activity is undertaken pursuant to the Board&rsquo;s
            responsibilities under Part VI of the National Energy Board Act and
            the Board&rsquo;s decision in GHR-1-87.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Energy Market Assessment (EMA), entitled Ultimate Potential for
            Unconventional Natural Gas in Northeastern British Columbia’s Horn
            River Basin, is part of a series of EMAs that provide information on
            the total gas resources of sedimentary basins in Canada. It is a
            joint assessment produced by the NEB and BC MEM (formerly British
            Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources). This
            series includes the NEB’s 2004 Canada’s Conventional Natural Gas
            Resources: A Status Report, and the 2006 report, Northeast British
            Columbia’s Ultimate Potential for Conventional Natural Gas,
            completed with the BC MEM, and the British Columbia Oil and Gas
            Commission. This EMA provides information on the unconventional gas
            resources in B.C.’s Horn River Basin and is the first in the series
            to describe the unconventional gas resources that are present in the
            country. Subsequent reports will be prepared as enough public data
            becomes available to perform the assessments.
          </p>

            agencies) conducted a series of informal meetings and discussions
            with certain companies exploring in B.C., specifically related to
            the Horn River Basin. The BC MEM and the NEB appreciate the
            information and comments provided and would like to thank all
            participants for sharing their time and expertise. The agencies
            decided the final model inputs.

            If a party wishes to rely on material from this report in any
            regulatory proceeding before the NEB, it may submit the material,
            just as it may submit any public document. Under these
            circumstances, the submitting party in effect adopts the material
            and that party could be required to answer questions pertaining to

          <h2 id="s3">Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The BC MEM and the NEB estimate supply and demand on a provincial
            and national scale, respectively. The ultimate potential for natural
            gas out of an area or sedimentary basin (how much gas is available
            to be produced) is recognized as a key component required to project
            future supply. The BC MEM’s and the NEB’s last complete study of
            B.C. was of the conventional resource potential and was completed
            in&nbsp;2006, based on year-end&nbsp;2003 data. The 2006 report
            indicated there was additional potential for natural gas in B.C. in
            unconventional reservoirs, but that there was not enough data to
            confidently estimate gas resources. That data is now starting to
            become available and, in&nbsp;2010, the BC MEM and the NEB
            determined that there was sufficient data to estimate the potential
            of the Horn River Basin shale gas play.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report, Ultimate Potential for Unconventional Natural Gas in
            Northeastern British Columbia’s Horn River Basin, is the first
            publicly released probabilistic resource assessment of a Canadian
            shale basin. The medium case estimate for marketable natural gas is
            2&nbsp;198&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; (78&nbsp;Tcf). Once added to
            the 2006 estimate for conventional ultimate potential, and
            accounting for cumulative production to year end&nbsp;2010 of
            602&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;(21.3&nbsp;Tcf), the estimate of
            remaining conventional and unconventional natural gas available for
            future demands is 3&nbsp;058&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;
            (109&nbsp;Tcf). This does not consider other unconventional gas
            resources which are known to exist in B.C.

          <h2 id="s4">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Canada plays an important role in the North American natural gas
            market. Today, Canada provides almost one-fifth of total North
            American gas production, although its share has fallen in recent
            years. Within Canada, the province of British Columbia is an
            important contributor to gas supply, accounting for about
            20&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of total Canadian production in&nbsp;2009
            (about 27.6&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; or 1&nbsp;Tcf), second only
            to Alberta. Currently, all of B.C.’s production comes from the
            northeastern region of the province (Figure&nbsp;1.1). Production
            growth in B.C. over the past ten years largely comes from
            development of unconventional gas (natural gas found in reservoirs
            requiring extensive drilling and/or production techniques), almost
            entirely tight gas and shale gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate potential for natural gas (how much gas is available to
            be produced out of an area) is a key component for projections of
            future supply. It provides basic information from which the pace of
            development, economics, and future production can be estimated. As
            drilling and completion technology advances, new information on the
            resource is learned, which contributes to increased certainty. It is
            important to note, however, that this analysis is based on current
            regulatory, technological, and economic conditions. The analysis in
            this report does not account for how future conditions may affect
            resource development.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s5"></a>1.1 Scope</h3>
          <p>
            This report focuses on shale gas (i.e., gas contained in shale
            formations), where economic recovery has been made possible by the
            application of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic
            fracturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report does not specifically address the economics of
            discovering, developing or producing B.C.’s gas resources. Nor does
            it deal with the rate of discovery or productive capacity for
            natural gas. This report and the associated data are meant to form
            the basis for economic analysis and supply projections by the BC
            MEM, NEB or others. This joint assessment benefited from the local
            knowledge of the BC MEM geologists and from the input received from
            the various oil and gas companies pursuing development of these
            resources. The agencies will continue to monitor developments in the
            size of the resource base for natural gas in British Columbia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, some portion of a gas resource may not be accessible from
            the surface due to physical features such as large lakes, extreme
            topography, or due to alternative surface uses such as cities or
            parks. In northeastern B.C., most areas can be accessed through
            advances in horizontal drilling, where wells can reach more than
            two&nbsp;kilometres (km) sideways from the surface location.
            However, in some cases, access to these vertical or directional
            drilling locations could be precluded by restrictions on the
            construction of necessary access roads or by prohibitively costly
            permitting or mitigation requirements. Since these determinations
            are quite site-specific, adjustments to the ultimate potential for
            access restrictions were not considered for this assessment.

          <h3 id="s6">1.2 Terminology</h3>
          <p>
            For the purpose of this report, the term ultimate potential
            (Figure&nbsp;1.2) refers to an estimate of the volume of marketable
            gas reserves that will have been proven to exist in an area after
            production has ceased, having regard for the geological prospects of
            that area and anticipated technology and economic conditions.

          </table>
          <p>
            Discovered resources have been confirmed by wells already drilled
            whereas undiscovered resources are expected to be discovered by
            future drilling. Discovered resources consist of the volumes of gas
            already produced (cumulative production), the known reserves that
            are still to be produced, and known resources that are not yet
            confirmed as economic to produce under current economic conditions,
            but could be available under better economic conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since estimates of ultimate potential refer to a volume of gas to be
            discovered in the future, the estimates always have a degree of
            uncertainty. The amount of uncertainty varies for each component of
            the estimate. Undiscovered resources have the highest amount of
            uncertainty, since there is no specific information about them. For
            the discovered, there is less uncertainty, because the resource has
            been drilled and at least some of its characteristics have been
            measured. Finally, there is no uncertainty for the volumes already
            produced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional terminology used in describing discovered resources, or
            in calculating estimates of the undiscovered resources and ultimate
            potential are as follows. Gas in place (GIP) is the initial volume
            of gas in the reservoir; recoverable gas is the volume of GIP that
            can be produced, and marketable gas is the volume of recoverable gas
            that remains after processing. The undiscovered GIP is reduced to
            marketable volumes by applying an expected recovery factor and
            surface loss.

          <h3 id="s7">1.3 Units of Measure</h3>
          <p>
            The data in this report are presented in metric units, followed,
            where appropriate, by the imperial equivalents in brackets. Natural
            gas volumes in metric units are at the conditions of
            101.325&nbsp;kilopascals (kPa) and 15&nbsp;degrees Celsius (&deg;C).
            For imperial units, BC MEM uses conditions of 14.65&nbsp;pounds per
            square inch absolute (psia) and 60&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit (&deg;F),
            while the NEB uses 14.73 psia and 60&deg;F. For the purposes of this
            report, a conversion factor of 35.49373 cubic feet per cubic metre
            (cf/m&sup3;) has been used, reflecting the standard conditions used
            by the BC MEM. Readers requiring a conversion to the NEB conditions
            should use a conversion factor of 35.30096 cf/m&sup3;.
          </p>
          <p>
            All gas volumes in this report are shown on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo;
            basis, with no adjustment for heating value.

          <h3><a id="s8"></a>1.4 Effective Date of Data</h3>
          <p>
            Work began on this study in mid-2010 and continued into&nbsp;2011.
            Data analysis and updates were done on existing databases throughout
            that period and new databases specific to the ultimate potential
            study were developed.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s9"></a>1.5 Updates to this Study</h3>
          <p>
            Although this study accounts for drilling to year-end&nbsp;2010, the
            release of information is sometimes slow, especially in new plays
            such as the Horn River Basin where the granting of Experimental
            Schemes by the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission (BC OGC) can add
            considerably to the duration of confidentiality agreements. The
            agencies intend to maintain the computer systems, databases, and
            processes used in this report to update the data on an ongoing
            basis. Changes may be reported in the annual releases of the BC
            OGC’s Hydrocarbon and By-Product Reserves in British Columbia
            reports or in various NEB publications.

          <h3 id="s12">2.1 Methodology</h3>
          <p>
            The estimate of the ultimate potential for unconventional natural
            gas in the Horn River Basin of northeastern B.C. was determined by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              reviewing pertinent data, relevant prior studies, and other
              information;
            </li>
            <li>
              mapping some of the geological characteristics of the Muskwa,
              Otter Park, and Evie shales of the Horn River Basin so that they
              were in a grid format based on the British Columbia drilling
              spacing unit (grid spacing of 1415.5&nbsp;m by 1856.0&nbsp;m) (see
              Chapter&nbsp;2.4);
            </li>
            <li>
              using a probabilistic method loosely based on the NEB report
              Canada’s Conventional Natural Gas Resources – A Status Report
              (2004). Substantial modifications were required, however, because
              there is currently no provincial reserves information available
              with which to estimate GIP numbers in drilled sections. Therefore,
              GIP numbers were calculated from basic reservoir data. The new
              model is discussed in detail in Appendix&nbsp;2;
            </li>
            <li>
              gathering input from industry active in the study area; and,
            </li>
            <li>relying on the expertise of the agencies.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Simply put, probabilistic assessments give reservoir characteristics
            (like thickness, for example) a range of possibilities spread across
            low, most likely, and high values, where the low and high values
            have a low probability of occurring while the most likely value has
            the highest probability of occurring (Figure&nbsp;2.1). Thus, in a
            Monte Carlo simulation where there are 500 iterations (essentially
            rolling the dice for each reservoir characteristic 500&nbsp;times to
            simulate 500 potential outcomes for a single basin), it becomes
            possible to estimate low, expected, and high values for the gas
            potential of that basin (P10, Expected, and P90, respectively). This
            is the first publicly released probabilistic assessment of a shale
            gas play in Canada. As a result, comments about the methodology are
            welcomed.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s13"></a>2.1.1 Gas in Place</h3>
          <p>
            Natural gas in shales dominantly exists in two states: 1)&nbsp;free
            gas, where the gas is found in a gaseous state in the spaces between
            mineral grains or within organic matter; and 2)&nbsp;adsorbed gas,
            where the gas is weakly stuck to surfaces of the organic matter and
            clays. While free gas can flow freely through pore spaces and
            fractures, adsorbed gas must be desorbed first (become unstuck) by
            reducing reservoir pressure before it can flow. By understanding
            some of the basic, physical characteristics of the shales it is
            possible to estimate the amount of natural gas in the reservoir. For
            example, the thickness, areal extent, and the percentage of porosity
            in the reservoir can be multiplied together to estimate total pore
            space available for free gas. Also, the amount of organic matter in
            the rock can help determine the amount of gas that can adsorb to the
            shale under varying pressures.

            Geological characteristics typically vary within a sedimentary basin
            and the amount of GIP will change from area to area. For Horn River
            Basin shales, geological characteristics were therefore mapped where
            data permitted and these maps became the basis of the assessment.
            GIP volumes were estimated for each tract (i.e. map-grid point) to
            better model how volumes changed across the basin. Tracts were
            summed to estimate total potential. A tract was considered
            discovered if it had a vertical well associated with it and if that
            well had any data used in any of the mapping. A tract was also
            considered discovered if a horizontal well was present. Otherwise,
            the tract was considered undiscovered. Technical details are
            available in Appendix&nbsp;2.

          <h3><a id="s14"></a>2.1.2 Marketable Gas</h3>
          <p>
            The use of the term &quot;marketable&quot; implies a sense of
            economic recovery. However, for the purposes of this report,
            &quot;marketable&quot; refers to a technically recoverable volume
            under foreseeable market conditions. No rigorous economic assessment
            was performed for this study, though the NEB released an Energy
            Briefing Note in November&nbsp;2010 indicating that the average cost
            of producing Horn River Basin shales was $4.68/GJ in&nbsp;2009, not
            including pipeline tolls<sup>[3]</sup>. The 2010 study used a number
            of simplifying assumptions and its applicability to specific
            development is limited. In general, Horn River Basin gas would not
            appear to be economic at current prices, but could become more
            attractive if costs continue to decline, which is typical for shale
            gas as development proceeds.

            A grid-based method was used to estimate marketable resources in the
            Horn River Basin similar to that for GIP. To estimate the amount of
            marketable free gas, the agencies considered how much of the gas
            would be successfully recovered through drilling and hydraulic
            fracturing using current practices. Given the lack of long-term
            production from the Horn River Basin, free gas recovery factors are
            highly uncertain. For this project, recovery factors varied for each
            shale, but most likely values ranged between&nbsp;15 and
            25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. The agencies also considered how much gas
            would be removed as gas impurities (so that the gas was of pipeline
            grade) and how much gas would be extracted as fuel gas to transport
            and process the raw gas. The amount of impurities in Horn River
            Basin shale gas appears to vary by shale, with some wells as low as
            eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent with others as high as
            19&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, dominantly consisting of carbon dioxide. The
            impurities increase with depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            To estimate marketable adsorbed gas the agencies considered likely
            abandonment pressures for producing wells and used similar recovery
            factors as used for free gas to determine how much of the desorbed
            gas could escape from the reservoir.

          <p>
            Although the Horn River Basin shale gas play is relatively new,
            there are many older wells that penetrated the shale while companies
            were exploring for deeper conventional resources. These wells
            provided data, such as shale depth and thickness. Newer wells are
            now available, including horizontal wells, though not all have been
            released from their confidential status. While some confidential
            data was used in the assessment, almost all the associated wells
            were to be released from confidential status by the release of this
            document. Altogether, 337 unique wells were used.

          <h3><a id="s17"></a>2.4 Geological Description</h3>
          <h4><a id="s18"></a>2.4.1 Setting</h4>
          <p>
            The Horn River Basin is located in northeastern B.C., and extends
            northward into the Northwest Territories (Figure&nbsp;1.1). During
            the Middle Devonian period (approximately 375 million years ago),
            the Presqu'ile barrier reef extended from Alberta, through B.C., and
            into the Yukon and Northwest Territories (Figure&nbsp;2.2). The reef
            was an area of shallow, well circulated sea-water where fine calcite
            mud and the skeletons of reef growing organisms were deposited and
            converted to limestone and dolostone after they were buried. Clays,
            fine siliceous (silica-rich) muds, and organic matter from dead
            plankton were deposited in the deeper, poorly oxygenated waters of
            the Horn River Basin to the west and in the Cordova Embayment to the
            east and were converted over time into shale deposits. In both
            areas, the shales have been sub-divided into, from the bottom up,
            the Evie, Otter Park and, Muskwa shales (Figure&nbsp;2.3) and
            contain enough organic material to have generated natural gas. Some
            of the gas migrated into the Presqu’ile barrier and was locally
            trapped in conventional oil and gas pools.<sup>[5]</sup>

          <h4><a id="s19"></a>2.4.2 Evie Shale</h4>
          <p>
            The Evie Shale consists of dark grey to black,
            radioactive<sup>[6]</sup>, organic-rich, pyritic, variably
            calcareous (calcite-rich), and siliceous shale. This unit is
            characterized on well logs by relatively high gamma-ray readings and
            high resistivity. The uppermost part of the unit includes more silt
            and generally has lower radioactivity and resistivity. In the Horn
            River Basin, the Evie is over 75&nbsp;m thick immediately west of
            the Presqu'ile barrier reef and thins westward to less than
            40&nbsp;m thick in the vicinity of the Bovie Lake Structure (western
            margin of the basin). The Evie Shale overlies limestones and
            dolostones of the Lower Keg River Formation.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [6] Organic-rich shales are &ldquo;radioactive&rdquo; in the sense
            that they have higher levels of radiation than other typical
            sedimentary rocks (during deposition, the organic matter attracts
            and binds dissolved uranium from sea water). The actual amount of
            radioactive material is extremely small. This radioactivity helps to
            distinguish shales from sandstones and carbonates on electric well
            logging tools.

          <h4><a id="s20"></a>2.4.3 Otter Park Shale</h4>
          <p>
            The Otter Park Shale reaches a maximum thickness of over 270&nbsp;m
            in the southeast corner of the Horn River Basin, where it consists
            of medium to dark grey calcareous shale with lower radioactivity and
            resistivity on well logs than the Evie and Muskwa Shales. The Otter
            Park thins to the north and west, and begins to include radioactive
            siliceous black shale beds.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s21"></a>2.4.4 Muskwa Shale</h4>
          <p>
            The Muskwa consists of grey to black, radioactive, organic-rich,
            pyritic, siliceous shales, and is characterized on well logs by high
            gamma ray readings and high resistivity. It has a gradational
            contact with the overlying silt-rich shales of the Fort Simpson
            Formation. In the Horn River Basin, the Muskwa is 30&nbsp;m thick
            adjacent to the Presqu'ile barrier reef and thickens westward to
            over 60&nbsp;m in the vicinity of the Bovie Lake Structure on the
            western side of the basin. However, the Muskwa thins considerably
            where the Otter Park thickness reaches its maximum in the southeast
            corner of the Horn River Basin. Unlike the underlying shales, the
            Muskwa is not restricted to the Horn River Basin, but thins and
            extends over the top of the barrier reef and is present through the
            rest of northeastern British Columbia. It is also stratigraphically
            equivalent with the Duvernay Shale, which extends over much of
            Alberta.

            <a id="s22"></a>2.5 Results for Gas in Place and Marketable Gas
          </h3>
          <p>
            Having regard for the inherent uncertainty in estimating geological
            prospects and predicting gas potential, the agencies estimate the
            ultimate GIP in the Horn River Basin to be 10
            466&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; (372&nbsp;Tcf) to
            14&nbsp;894&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;(529&nbsp;Tcf), with the
            expected outcome of 12&nbsp;629&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;
            (448&nbsp;Tcf), as shown in Table&nbsp;2.1 and Figure&nbsp;2.4. The
            marketable resource base is expected to be
            1&nbsp;715&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;(61&nbsp;Tcf) to
            2&nbsp;714&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;(96&nbsp;Tcf), with the
            expected outcome of 2&nbsp;198&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;
            (78&nbsp;Tcf), as shown in Table&nbsp;2.1 and Figure&nbsp;2.5. The
            ultimate potential will very likely meet or exceed the low-case
            estimates. The medium case represents the most realistic outcome.
            The high case is possible, though unlikely to occur. A certain
            volume of marketable natural gas has been excluded from the
            assessment based on untenured land at the date of the report. The
            estimates of discovered and undiscovered resources are in
            Table&nbsp;2.2 and the medium case estimate for each shale of the
            Horn River Basin is presented in Table&nbsp;2.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            The excluded volume in Table&nbsp;2.1 represents gas that, in the
            opinion of the agencies, is not likely to be developed in the low
            and medium case estimates due to reservoir conditions assumed in
            those cases. In the high case estimate, the volume of gas currently
            considered excluded would have a higher likelihood of being
            developed given its size.

          <h3><a id="s23"></a>2.6 Comparison with Previous Studies</h3>
          <p>
            The only previously published study of resource potential in the
            Horn River Basin<sup>[7]</sup>determined GIP resources of the Horn
            River Basin, Cordova Embayment, and Liard Basin, estimating GIP to
            be between 4&nbsp;078&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; (144&nbsp;Tcf) and
            more than 16 992&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; (600&nbsp;Tcf). No
            attempt to break out the gas resources between basins and no
            estimate for marketable resources was made. The BC MEM released the
            results of an internal study in&nbsp;2009 suggesting the Horn River
            Basin contained between 8&nbsp;496&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;
            (300&nbsp;Tcf) and 22&nbsp;656&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;
            (800&nbsp;Tcf) of GIP.

          </p>
          <p>
            As described in previous NEB reports, estimates of ultimate
            potential generally tend to increase over time. In the Horn River
            Basin, the GIP of the mid-Devonian shales is not likely to increase
            substantially. Marketable resources may increase as more information
            is gained from longer term production data. Marketable resources may
            also increase if the cost of further development falls, or gas
            prices increase substantially. Further, other resources may be
            discovered in overlying or underlying units during the course of
            development.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s24"></a>2.7 Canadian Resources</h3>
          <p>
            The NEB, as part of its mandate, maintains estimates of ultimate
            potential for all regions of Canada. Its most current estimates of
            Canadian resources were provided in its joint 2008 Report
            Saskatchewan’s Ultimate Potential for Conventional Natural Gas.
            Tables&nbsp;2.4 A and&nbsp;2.4B show the current estimates of
            ultimate potential of conventional natural gas in Canada in both
            metric and imperial units, respectively, and are current to
            year-end&nbsp;2009. In addition, the NEB is completing a list of
            ultimate potential estimates of unconventional natural gas in Canada
            that will be populated as assessments are completed.
            Tables&nbsp;2.5A and&nbsp;2.5B are current to year-end&nbsp;2010.
            The combination of Tables&nbsp;2.4 and&nbsp;2.5 in either metric or
            imperial units will provide the total ultimate potential for the
            country.

          <p>
            The estimate of ultimate potential for marketable unconventional
            natural gas in the shales of the Horn River Basin of northeastern
            B.C. is 2&nbsp;198&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; (78&nbsp;Tcf). The new
            assessment identifies a new resource available to British Columbia
            and Canada that can be used to meet a significant portion of natural
            gas demand going forward and ranks among the most prospective shale
            gas basins in North America (Table&nbsp;3.1).
          </p>

            3.2 Reservoir Properties of the Horn River Basin Shales
          </h3>
          <p>
            Certain trends became evident during analysis of the data for this
            study. Overall, all three shale zones carry significant potential.
            The Otter Park, however, varies substantially across the basin,
            losing significant potential to the south near the Presqu’ile
            barrier reef, where limestone marls were deposited at the expense of
            shale.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s28">3.3 Access Restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            The use of the @Risk model allows for an approximate determination
            of undiscovered resources that may be precluded from development by
            surface access restrictions. Due to the absence of national parks,
            large urban areas and large lakes in northeastern B.C., there does
            not appear to be any significant resource volumes that, in theory,
            cannot be accessed through directional drilling technology. Industry
            consultations did not give a clear indication that there were any
            resources that have been sterilized for all practical purposes due
            to surface restrictions. Practically however, incremental costs
            associated with directional drilling can have a significant impact
            on competitiveness.

              The estimate of ultimate potential for unconventional shale gas in
              the Horn River Basin of northeastern B.C. is
              2&nbsp;198&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; (78&nbsp;Tcf).
            </li>
            <li>
              Discovered resources are 84&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3;
              (3&nbsp;Tcf) and undiscovered resources are
              2&nbsp;114&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>m&sup3; (75&nbsp;Tcf).
            </li>
            <li>
              An area in the south of the Horn River Basin is excluded from the
              marketable estimate because the land is currently untenured, which
              would presumably restrict its development.
            </li>
            <li>
              The remaining resources can support high drilling levels for many
              years in the province.
            </li>
            <li>
              Northeastern British Columbia now holds about
              55&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the reported ultimate remaining
              conventional and unconventional natural gas resources in the
              Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are a number of other unconventional natural gas plays in
              British Columbia and elsewhere in the country which, if developed,
              could substantially increase the resources available for Canadian
              use and export purposes. The agencies intend to assess these B.C.
              plays as time, data, and resources allow. The NEB also intends to
              assess unconventional plays elsewhere in the country.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>
            Like prior assessments of conventional resources, the NEB uses Monte
            Carlo simulations to provide a range of results of varying
            probabilities.
          </p>
          <h4>Assumptions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Stratigraphic units are treated as individual resources and the
              assessment is limited to the geographic area defined as the shale
              basin even if the resource may extend beyond the confines of the
              basin.
            </li>
            <li>
              The resource is considered a resource play, where gas is
              pervasively distributed through the geologically defined play
              area. Thus, success at discovering the resource with a well is
              100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.
            </li>
            <li>
              No study has been undertaken to determine the economics for
              marketable resources and the determination of what is economic is
              based on the experience of the agencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recovery factors are based on existing technology, though
              reasonable advancements are assumed. No detailed analyses of
              technological advancements have been performed for this study.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Data</h4>
          <p>The data used in this study included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic well data, including location and formation tops</li>
            <li>Stratigraphic intervals: zones and aerial extent</li>
            <li>
              Zone evaluation: formation depth, gross pay, net pay, porosity,
              gas saturation, pressure, temperature, and TOC
            </li>
            <li>
              Fluid properties: gas or oil, Z&nbsp;factor, and gas contents
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Stratigraphy and Area Breakdown</h4>
          <h4>Stratigraphic Intervals</h4>
          <p>
            The project team reviewed relevant formations in the project area
            and divided gas-bearing horizons into stratigraphic units. For each
            well, reservoir parameters were estimated for each stratigraphic
            unit where data permitted.
          </p>
          <h4>Play Area</h4>
          <p>
            For this study, each stratigraphic unit was represented by a single
            play area because insufficient data prevented identification of
            separate areas with common characteristics. In the future, as data
            become more available, the shale basin may be subdivided.
          </p>
          <h4>Play Area tracts</h4>
          <p>
            Each play area was further subdivided into spacing units. For this
            study, 1415.5&nbsp;m by&nbsp;1856.0&nbsp;m tracts were used because
            the spacing was close to the drill-spacing unit used by the BC OGC.
          </p>
          <h4>Resource Evaluation Process</h4>
          <h4>Formulas</h4>
          <p>
            Shale gas (as well as coalbed methane) dominantly consists of two
            gas types: free gas, which is natural gas stored in pore spaces and
            fractures, and adsorbed gas, which is natural gas adsorbed to
            organic matter and clay in the reservoir. Therefore, the total
            natural gas stored in a shale prior to production can be determined
            by using the following basic equation:
          </p>
          <p>
            GIP<sub>total</sub> = GIP<sub>free</sub> + GIP<sub>adsorbed</sub>
          </p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>GIP<sub>total</sub> = total gas in place</li>
            <li>GIP<sub>free</sub> = free gas in place</li>
            <li>GIP<sub>adsorbed</sub> = adsorbed gas in place</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Marketable resources can be calculated with the following equation
          </p>
          <p>MR<sub>total</sub> = MR<sub>free</sub> + MR<sub>adsorbed</sub></p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MR<sub>total</sub> = Total marketable resources</li>
            <li>MR<sub>free</sub> = Free marketable resources</li>
            <li>MR<sub>adsorbed</sub> = Adsorbed marketable resources</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Further, for marketable resources, geographic components to the
            resource were excluded where the reservoir was considered too
            uneconomic to develop, as determined and mapped by the agencies.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Free gas</strong></p>
          <p>
            Because of a lack of reserves data, free gas and adsorbed gas
            contents were estimated from basic reservoir data extracted from
            well logs, core, and flow and pressure tests. A standard volumetric
            equation was used for free gas:
          </p>
          <p>
            GIP<sub>free</sub> = A &times; H &times; NtG &times; &Phi; &times;
            SG &times; ( (D &times; PG &times; TS) / (P<sub>S</sub> &times; D
            &times; TG &times; Z))
          </p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>GIP<sub>free</sub> = gas in place (m&sup3;)</li>
            <li>A = area (m&sup2;)</li>
            <li>H = gross formation thickness (m)</li>
            <li>NtG = net pay to gross pay ratio (percentile)</li>
            <li>&Phi; = porosity (percentile)</li>
            <li>S<sub>G</sub> = gas saturation (percentile)</li>
            <li>D = formation depth (m)</li>
            <li>PG = pressure gradient (MPa/m)</li>
            <li>P<sub>S</sub> = surface pressure (MPa)</li>
            <li>TG = temperature gradient (degrees Kelvin)</li>
            <li>T<sub>S</sub> = surface temperature (degrees Kelvin)</li>
            <li>Z = gas compressibility (unitless)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Marketable free gas was estimated with the equation:</p>
          <p>MR<sub>free</sub> = GIP<sub>free</sub> × (1 - SL) × RF</p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MR<sub>free</sub> = marketable gas in place (m&sup3;)</li>
            <li>
              SL = surface loss (percentile; includes gas impurities and fuel
              gas)
            </li>
            <li>RF = recovery factor (percentile)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Adsorbed gas</strong></p>
          <p>The following equation was used to estimate adsorbed gas:</p>
          <p>
            GIP<sub>adsorbed</sub> = A &times; H &times; NtG &times; &rho;b
            &times; (1- &Phi;) &times; ( (TOC &times; L tO &times; D &times; PG
            ) / (PL + PF))
          </p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&Rho;b = rock-matrix density (kg/m&sup3;)</li>
            <li>TOC = total organic content (percentile)</li>
            <li>LtO = Langmuir Volume to Total Organic Content (m&sup3;/kg)</li>
            <li>P<sub>L</sub> = Langmuir Pressure (MPa)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To estimate marketable adsorbed gas:</p>
          <p>
            MR<sub>adsorbed</sub> = RF &times;{GIP<sub>adsorbed</sub> - [A
            &times; H &times; NtG &times; &rho;b &times; (1- &Phi;) &times;
            ((TOC &times; LtO &times; D &times; PG ) / (P<sub>L</sub> +
            P<sub>F</sub>))]}
          </p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PA = Abandonment pressure (MPa)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Correlated Variables</strong></p>
          <p>Correlations between variables are assumed to be:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Recovery factors positively correlate to pressure, porosity, and
              gas saturation
            </li>
            <li>Porosity positively correlates to TOC content</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Some variables were calibrated against other variables to tie them
            into mapped data and, therefore, give a result more based on local
            conditions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Pressure gradient was multiplied by depth to become reservoir
              pressure
            </li>
            <li>
              Temperature gradient was multiplied by depth to become reservoir
              temperature
            </li>
            <li>
              Z factor (based on a mix of typical Horn River Basin gas contents)
              was calibrated to depth
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural gas impurities were calibrated to depth and, in turn, fuel
              gas for processing was calibrated to natural gas impurities
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Geological Mapping</strong></p>
          <p>
            The agencies mapped four major characteristics of each reservoir by
            constructing map grids: depth, thickness, net-to-gross pay ratio,
            and pressure gradient. As more data becomes available for other
            reservoir parameters such that characteristics can be mapped with
            reasonable confidence, additional parameters (for example, porosity)
            may be mapped in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shale thickness values and subsea values were calculated for each
            well in the data set and subsequently gridded using a grid interval
            with one grid node per tract. Depth to each shale unit was a product
            of subsea and digital elevation model grids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Net shale pay was determined from a subset of wells throughout the
            basin, favouring wells with modern digital logs in LAS format.
            Cut-offs were chosen as a qualitative best approximation of pay
            throughout the Horn River shales. A net shale pay to gross thickness
            ratio was then calculated for each of the wells.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each shale unit (Muskwa, Otter Park and Evie), the final result
            was a series of grids including gross thickness, net to gross ratio,
            and depth. A pressure-gradient map was shared for all three shales
            and was based on the limited amount of pressure data available in
            the basin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Z-factor was calibrated to depth using a typical Horn River Basin
            gas content, reservoir pressures, and temperatures, using the
            formula:
          </p>
          <p>
            Z = 0.000000000124093P&sup2; + 0.000004343739202P+0.656780747688992
          </p>
          <p>where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Z = compressibility (dimensionless)</li>
            <li>P = reservoir pressure (kPa – dimensionless input)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Surface loss (SL) was estimated using two components:
            non-hydrocarbon impurity content and fuel gas for gas transport and
            gas processing. Non-hydrocarbon impurity contents in gas samples
            were plotted against formation depth to determine likely shrinkages
            and how they vary by depth across the basin. The following equation
            was used:
          </p>
          <p>NHC = IG × D - b</p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>NHC = non-hydrocarbon impurity content (percentile)</li>
            <li>IG = impurity gradient (percentile per m)</li>
            <li>D = depth (m)</li>
            <li>b = Y intercept (percentile)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Fuel-gas consumption for gas transport (including future well-site
            gas compression) was a constant three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. Gas
            processing was based on the non-hydrocarbon impurity content: the
            non-hydrocarbon impurity content was multiplied by&nbsp;1.5 to
            estimate total gas removed as impurities and fuel gas for
            processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            A summary of the reservoir parameters, their correlations, and the
            origin of the data is available in Table&nbsp;A.1
          </p>
          <p><strong>Data Processing</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Discovered and Undiscovered Tracts</strong></p>
          <p>
            Tracts were assigned &ldquo;discovered” status if the evaluated
            formation was penetrated by a vertical well or if it contained the
            bottom-hole location of a horizontal well (in order to include
            resources discovered by horizontal wells). More than one formation
            can be produced from a single horizontal well in the Horn River
            Basin, however, because the shale formations are stacked on each
            other and hydraulic fracturing typically creates fractures that
            extend into adjacent stratigraphic units. Therefore, each
            stratigraphic unit was considered discovered where any of the three
            were penetrated by a horizontal well. Tracts not assigned
            &ldquo;discovered” status were assigned &ldquo;undiscovered” status.
            As more becomes known about the Horn River Basin and the extent of
            hydraulically induced fractures, it may become possible to better
            assign discovered and undiscovered resources in horizontal wells.

            <strong>Data Extraction for Discovered Tracts from Grid</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Data for reservoir-parameter modeling was extracted from the map
            grids and assigned to discovered tracts based on whether wells
            drilled through those tracts contained values used to construct the
            grid. For example, if a discovered tract contained a well with a
            net-to-gross value, the net-to-gross field for that tract would be
            filled with the value from the grid. In this way, if there was more
            than one well to a tract, the value would more likely represent the
            average. If no data was present in the well for that field, no grid
            value was assigned and the discovered tract remained null.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using this method, data was extracted from the net-to-gross and
            pressure-gradient grids. Depth and thickness were considered static
            values and extended to all tracts whether they were drilled or not
            because of the relatively high certainty of these formation
            characteristics.

          <p><strong>Resource Modeling</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>
            The gas resource is estimated stochastically by applying
            probability-distribution curves to most of the variables in the Free
            Gas and Adsorbed Gas equations on a tract by tract basis. Discovered
            tracts use real data where present and distribution curves where
            absent. Undiscovered tracts are entirely assigned distribution
            curves for each relevant variable. Monte Carlo simulations are then
            run to simulate a number of random basins and the volume of gas in
            each random basin is the sum of its tracts. Because of the range of
            possibilities, it is possible to determine low, most likely, and
            high values for discovered and undiscovered segments of GIP and
            marketable resources.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
          <p>
            The resource evaluation was integrated at two levels: 1)&nbsp;a
            tract-by-tract scale and 2)&nbsp;a basin scale (Figure&nbsp;A.1).
            Essentially, the tract-by-tract scale should be thought of as the
            potential for gas on a tract-by-tract basis. Given the possibility
            for a wide variety of reservoir conditions on such a small scale
            (just less than a square mile), where a few tracts out of a few
            thousand may have outlier high or low values, the range can be very
            wide. However, because the basin is very early in its development
            and there is low sampling density, the shape of any
            probability-distribution curve associated with that range is highly
            uncertain (i.e.&nbsp;the curve could easily be skewed one way or the
            other).
          </p>
          <p>
            To simulate the uncertainty of base-curve shapes at the
            tract-by-tract level, a second set of distributions is applied at
            the basin level (i.e. a distribution of
            distributions<sup>[8]</sup>). This second set represents the most
            likely value for the basin in its entirety. As such, it has a
            narrower range because the overall basin is not expected to have the
            extreme outliers that individual tracts have within it. As the
            basin’s most likely value gets higher or lower for each iteration in
            the Monte Carlo simulation, the most likely value of the base curves
            at the tract level becomes higher or lower with it, thus changing
            their shape.

          <p><strong>Distribution curve selection</strong></p>
          <p>
            Often in resource assessments with limited sample data, triangular
            distributions are used to represent uncertainty because data is
            scarce enough to restrict the use of software &ldquo;curve fitting”.
            However, triangular distributions are considered weak by some in
            that they overweight probabilities towards the tail ends of the
            distribution. Therefore, in this study, beta distributions were used
            to allow for the existence of very low probability outlier tails.
            The @Risk RiskBetaPERT function is a flexible beta curve that allows
            users to input high and low values as well as a most likely value as
            in a triangular distribution. The ability to input a most likely
            value for a Beta curve was also significant because it permitted
            tract-by-tract curves to have their most likely value change: the
            input for the most likely value could be made the basin-scale
            distribution curve, which then allowed the tract-by-tract curve to
            vary for each iteration.

          <p><strong>Distribution curve utilization</strong></p>
          <p>
            Probability distributions were used in four ways: 1)&nbsp;where the
            mapped value was directly applied to the distribution; 2)&nbsp;where
            the distribution was directly correlated to another mapped value;
            3)&nbsp;a mix of the previous two, and 4)&nbsp;stand-alone.

              Data extracted from the Net-to-Gross map grid were modeled using
              curve-fitting capabilities of @Risk software. Fitted curves were
              used to identify likely modes, averages, and low and high values.
              For each tract, the grid value on the map was applied to the Beta
              distribution as the mode (most likely). The upper and lower values
              for the Beta distribution were the upper and lower values likely
              to occur in any tract in the entire area. The curve was then
              shifted left or right based on the basin-scale distribution while
              keeping the upper and lower limits, effectively moving the peak
              from side to side and changing the shape of the curve.
            </li>
            <li>
              A linear correlation between non-hydrocarbon gas impurities and
              depth was created based on gas samples, which permitted for a
              shrinkage estimate for each tract. A distribution was integrated
              so the estimated non-hydrocarbon impurity contents could wander
              higher or lower based on upper and lower boundaries as determined
              from the scatter of data points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data extracted from the Pressure Gradient map grid were modeled
              using curve-fitting capabilities of @Risk software. Curves were
              used to identify likely modes, averages, and low and high values.
              The pressure gradient value for each tract was ultimately
              multiplied by the corresponding depth from the depth grid to
              estimate the most likely pressure value. The minimum and maximum
              values from the curve fitting were multiplied by depth to
              determine the minimum and maximum pressures for each tract. The
              curve was then shifted left or right based on the basin-scale
              distribution while keeping the upper and lower limits, effectively
              moving the peak from side to side and changing the shape of the
              curve.

              Standalone probability distributions were porosity, gas
              saturation, recovery factor, total organic content, and the
              Langmuir volume to TOC ratio (whose low, most likely, and high
              values originated from a graph of Langmuir volumes plotted against
              sample depth; Figure&nbsp;A.2).

              Z factor, Langmuir pressure, abandonment pressure, and matrix

              multiplied by depth to estimate reservoir temperature.

            A summary of which variables used distribution curves is present in
            Table&nbsp;A.1. A summary of the low, most likely, and high values
            for the tract-by-tract distributions and the basin-scale
            distributions are available in Table&nbsp;A.2.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Monte Carlo Simulations</strong></p>
          <p>
            Once all tracts were assigned data or distributions, a 500-iteration
            Monte Carlo simulation was run to determine GIP and marketable
            resources for each tract for both free and adsorbed gas. Tracts were
            summed to determine the GIP and marketable resources for the area. A
            spatial filter was applied to exclude gas from areas deemed too
            uneconomic to develop.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Summing of Results</strong></p>
          <p>
            @Risk curve-fitting capabilities were used to fit a distribution
            curve to the results for each shale (using Anderson-Darling
            statistics to determine the best fit) and the amount of GIP and
            marketable resources present in the Horn River Basin was summed
            using a 1000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation.

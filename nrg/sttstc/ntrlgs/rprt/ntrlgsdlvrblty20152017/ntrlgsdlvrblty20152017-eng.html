            The National Energy Board (NEB, or the Board) is an independent,
            federal, quasi-judicial regulator established to promote safety and
            security, environmental protection and economic efficiency within
            the mandate set by Parliament for the regulation of pipelines,
            energy development and trade. The Board's main responsibilities
            include regulating the construction, operation and abandonment of
            pipelines that cross international borders or provincial/territorial
            boundaries, as well as the associated pipeline tolls and tariffs,
            the construction and operation of international power lines, and
            designated interprovincial power lines and imports of natural gas
            and exports of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), natural gas,
            refined petroleum products and electricity.
          </p>
          <p>
            For oil and natural gas exports, the Board&rsquo;s role is to
            evaluate whether the oil and natural gas proposed to be exported is
            surplus to reasonably foreseeable Canadian requirements, having
            regard to the trends in the discovery of oil or gas in Canada. If a
            party wishes to rely on material from this report in any regulatory
            proceeding before the Board, it may submit the material, just as it
            may submit any public document. Under these circumstances, the
            submitting party in effect adopts the material and could be required
            to answer questions pertaining to its content. This report does not
            provide an indication about whether any application will be approved
            or not. The Board will decide on specific applications based on the
            material in evidence before it at that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            While preparing this report, in addition to conducting its own
            quantitative analysis, the NEB held a series of informal meetings
            and discussions with various industry and government stakeholders.
            The NEB appreciates the information and comments provided and would
            like to thank all participants for their time and expertise.

          <p>
            This report provides an outlook of Canadian natural gas
            deliverability<sup id="fn1-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a

            >
            from the beginning of&nbsp;2015 to the end of&nbsp;2017. The outlook
            presents three distinct cases, a Higher Range Price Case, Mid-Range
            Price Case, and a Lower Range Price Case, each of which are based on
            a range of assumptions. In all three cases, the 2015 North American
            natural gas market will continue to be oversupplied, as
            deliverability outpaces demand growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The colder than average winter of 2013-2014 depleted volumes of
            natural gas in storage, causing gas prices to increase and remain
            elevated until mid-way through 2014, when it became clear that
            deliverability was sufficient to avoid significant storage
            shortages. Despite the declining prices in the second half of 2014,
            Canadian and U.S. natural gas deliverability continued to increase
            to refill the remaining storage deficit. This momentum appears
            unlikely to continue, as several factors impede sustained Canadian
            natural gas deliverability growth through 2017. Lower prices, ample
            supply, and increased competition in key markets will challenge the
            competitiveness of Canadian natural gas and gas exports.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decline in oil prices since mid-2014 has impacted the North
            American natural gas market in the form of reduced revenues,
            constrained cash flows, and significantly less gas-targeted
            drilling. Decreased capital expenditures are expected to reduce
            total deliverability, but high-grading<sup id="fn2-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"

            >
            by producers in both Canada and the U.S. may improve per-well
            deliverability. Additional drilling could occur in Western Canada as
            some producers may attempt to establish natural gas reserves and
            assess deliverability potential to confirm supplies for future
            liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects. A final investment
            decision (FID) to proceed with a Canadian LNG export project in
            2015-2016 could accelerate this activity and result in increased
            Canadian deliverability over the projection period.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a Mid-Range Price Case, prices would fall from $4.35/MMBtu<sup
              id="fn3-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn3"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>3</a
              ></sup
            >
            in&nbsp;2014 to $3.55/MMBtu in&nbsp;2017, while Canadian natural gas
            deliverability remains relatively flat from
            416&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.7&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2014 to
            417&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.7&nbsp;Bcf/d)
            in&nbsp;2017. A Higher Price Case would see natural gas prices at
            $3.70/MMBtu by&nbsp;2017, resulting in more natural gas drilling and
            Canadian deliverability increasing to
            441&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (15.6&nbsp;Bcf/d)
            in&nbsp;2017. In a Lower Price Case, growth in markets for Canadian
            natural gas would decrease, potentially due to mild weather
            conditions, weak investment, and reduced competitiveness relative to
            the U.S. The Lower Price Case would see prices remaining at or below
            $3.10/MMBtu and deliverability declining to
            394&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (13.9&nbsp;Bcf/d)
            by&nbsp;2017. A comparison of the prices in each case can be found
            in Figure 1.1.

          <p><em>The North American Natural Gas Market</em></p>
          <p>
            Higher natural gas demand during the colder than average winter of
            2013-2014 decreased volumes of natural gas in storage. Decreased gas
            storage and mounting uncertainty regarding the adequacy of storage
            to meet demand the following winter caused prices to increase over
            the first half of 2014. Both Canadian and U.S. deliverability
            increased in 2014 and prices remained elevated until it became clear
            that deliverability was sufficient to meet demand and avoid any
            significant storage shortages. Production in the U.S. continues to
            satisfy an increasing portion of U.S. domestic demand that was
            previously met by Canadian producers.

                <li>
                  Natural gas produced in the U.S. is derived from tight
                  formations, shale formations, and as a byproduct from oil
                  production. It is serving an increasing share of U.S. demand,
                  which in turn reduces the need for Canadian natural gas
                  imports.

          <p><em>Current Trends in Supply and Demand</em></p>
          <p>
            The North American natural gas market continues to be oversupplied.
            By April 2015, the remaining storage deficit from the winter of
            2013-2014 was replenished and inventories returned to levels near
            the five-year average. As a consequence, gas storage can be expected
            to fill more rapidly during future injection seasons and
            deliverability is expected to outpace demand from 2015 to 2017. If
            storage reaches capacity and deliverability exceeds demand, there is
            a risk of production being shut in to reduce supply to balance
            markets.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cyclical imbalances of supply and demand are typical of the North
              American natural gas market. Demand often varies because of
              weather, changes to economic growth, and infrastructure
              constraints. Imbalances caused by these factors result in
              overshooting demand or undershooting supply.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A typical cycle occurs as follows: during periods of increased
                  demand, prices increase to ration supply and direct it toward
                  the markets that value it most. Higher prices also provide
                  incentives to develop and produce the next most costly natural
                  gas resources which can cause deliverability to exceed demand,
                  subsequently depressing prices. Lower prices discourage
                  production of high cost supply sources but at the same time
                  also foster demand. As demand grows, prices begin to rise
                  again and the cycle repeats itself.
                </li>

            </li>

            <li>
              Lower oil prices, and therefore revenues, have led to decreased
              capital expenditures, which has reduced drilling and service
              activity as companies work within available cash flows.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When producers are cash-strapped however, development is
                  focused on the most economical prospects while producers and
                  service companies attempt to reduce costs. The possible
                  outcome of these measures is not only lower costs, but
                  improved operational efficiencies and higher levels of
                  production per well.

              Modern drilling technologies, such as multi-stage hydraulic
              fracturing and multi-well pad drilling, are now used extensively,
              improving the economics of the Canadian and U.S. natural gas
              resource base and boosting deliverability.

                  Boosting the recoverable resource base and production in North
                  America has caused a surge in proposals for LNG export
                  facilities in North America to reach overseas markets.

            <li>
              It may take years for new major markets to develop for natural
              gas. The opportunity for natural gas to displace competing fuels
              in traditional space-heating markets in Canada and the U.S. has
              largely occurred already.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Proposed LNG export facilities represent large new natural gas
                  demands but involve long lead times to obtain approvals,
                  establish overseas markets, and construct facilities.
                  Currently, none of the proposed Canadian LNG projects with
                  approved export licenses have announced a FID. In the U.S.,
                  construction has begun on several LNG facilities and the first
                  facility is scheduled to come online in 2016<sup id="fn8-rf"

                  Other potential sources of major demand growth could require
                  years or decades to develop to a meaningful scale. Examples
                  include the domestic petrochemical industry taking an
                  increased share of capacity from overseas locations and the
                  widespread use of compressed natural gas or LNG to displace
                  diesel and gasoline in transportation markets.

            <li>
              Currently there is a growing inventory of wells being drilled but
              not completed in the U.S. By drilling wells and not completing
              them, producers avoid placing resources onto the market at lower
              prices, while still taking advantage of the lower drilling and
              service costs brought on by reduced activity. These wells have the
              potential to be completed later when prices start to rise, which
              would rapidly increase supply available in the market and supress
              movement toward higher prices.

          <p><em>Future Uncertainties</em></p>
          <p>
            Trends in future Canadian and U.S. deliverability are likely to
            follow a pattern similar to previous cycles, but several factors
            make it difficult to anticipate the duration and extent of the
            current cycle.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Lower prices for both crude oil and natural gas have impacted the
              credit ratings of small and mid-sized producers, making it more
              difficult to obtain debt financing. The lack of easy access to
              capital could make it difficult for some small and mid-sized
              producers to sustain their operations, creating the potential for
              bankruptcies or acquisitions of smaller producers by larger more
              financially stable companies.

                  dollars have begun to flow to producers and service companies
                  in the U.S. and Canada. Private equity investment may provide
                  the capital needed for smaller and mid-sized producers to
                  continue operations. Currently, private equity investment
                  activity appears a more prominent feature in the U.S. than
                  Canada which may result in greater increases in U.S.

              Previously, the attractive price spread between natural gas and
              natural gas liquids (NGLs<sup id="fn10-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn10"

              >) promoted NGL-targeted drilling and the natural gas price was of
              lesser consequence. Rising NGL deliverability is creating a supply
              glut in Canada and the U.S. and the oversaturated market for key
              NGLs (ethane, propane, butane) is leading to lower NGL prices and
              reduced producer revenues. Additional revenues from NGLs have
              helped support natural gas deliverability, but this uplift to gas
              deliverability is expected to diminish as the NGL supply overhang
              grows and NGL prices decline.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Heavier NGLs such as condensate have higher values in Western
                  Canada because they can be used to dilute bitumen for pipeline
                  transport. Therefore it is possible that select wet gas plays
                  rich in condensate could see sustained drilling activity in
                  Western Canada.

              Lower cost Marcellus gas is closer to markets in central Canada,
              the U.S. Northeast and U.S. Midwest, giving it cost advantages
              over Western Canadian gas. Growing production of Marcellus Shale
              gas will gain additional pipeline access to the U.S. Midwest
              beginning in 2015. An increasing amount of Marcellus gas is also
              expected to flow into central Canada displacing some demand that
              was previously satisfied by Western Canadian production. Marcellus
              Shale gas has significantly displaced Canadian exports from the
              U.S. Northeast market.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additional drilling could occur in Western Canada as producers
              confirm adequate deliverability for future LNG exports by
              assessing reserve and production potential. This activity was a
              significant contributor to the rise in 2014 Canadian gas
              deliverability. A FID to proceed with a Canadian LNG export
              project in 2015-2016 could accelerate this activity within the
              time period assessed in this report.

              The Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia was expected to
              help offset declining output from the Sable Offshore Energy
              Project. Currently, production from Deep Panuke is shut in due to
              issues with high levels of water being produced alongside gas
              production. Although Deep Panuke is expected to return to
              production by October 2015, incursion of water into the reservoir
              could adversely impact the amount of natural gas recoverable over
              the lifetime of the project.

            <li>
              The lower price of natural gas alongside environmental policy
              initiatives is encouraging the switching from coal to gas for
              power generation in the U.S. Coal-to-gas switching for power
              generation would create additional demand for natural gas. The
              majority of coal plant retirements to date have been aging units
              that were not heavily utilized. Displacement of modern efficient
              coal plants equipped with emissions controls would require lower
              gas prices in order to be competitive with coal.   The timing of
              further displacement of coal to gas in power generation will
              depend on costs to bring plants in compliance with environmental
              regulations, demand for power generation and relative prices of
              gas and coal.

          <p>
            Natural gas drilling activity in Canada increased year-over-year in
            2014 (Table&nbsp;3.1) due to higher gas prices, but drilling is
            expected to decline significantly throughout 2015. Increased
            deliverability from the U.S. has reduced gas prices and made some
            Western Canadian natural gas prospects uneconomic to pursue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three price cases for Canadian natural gas deliverability are
            examined in this report. These cases differ primarily in terms of
            Canadian and U.S. natural gas prices and the corresponding levels of
            capital investment. The Appendices contain a detailed description of
            the assumptions used for projecting deliverability.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all three price cases, drilling and investment in Canadian
            natural gas is projected to decrease significantly relative to 2014.
            Canadian deliverability from outside of Western Canada also declines
            in each of the three price cases. Moreover, all three price cases
            have incorporated a switch to seasonal production by the offshore
            Nova Scotia Deep Panuke project. The cases begin to differ in 2016
            and 2017 based on assumptions of the degree of widening (Lower Price
            Case) or tightening (Mid-Range and Higher Price Cases) between the
            balance of supply and demand in Canada and the U.S.

          <p>
            For this analysis, the Board divides natural gas production in
            Western Canada into conventional, coalbed methane (CBM), and shale
            gas, with tight gas included as a sub-category of conventional
            production. Due to large regional differences in geological and
            production characteristics the Board further subdivides these
            categories into smaller geographic areas, or regions, which have
            similar characteristics for production decline analysis. Within each
            region, grouping of the producing formations takes place on a
            geological basis. Details on the characterization of the resources
            are available in <a href="#nnx">Appendix&nbsp;B</a>. Canadian
            natural gas production outside of Western Canada includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Onshore production from New Brunswick, Ontario, Yukon, and
              Northwest Territories which is declining as minimal future
              drilling activity is expected over the projection period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nova Scotia production from the offshore Sable Island project is
              declining and the Deep Panuke project is temporarily shut in, but
              is expected to begin producing again in October 2015.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shale gas potential in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia;
              however, local policies currently prohibit the hydraulic
              fracturing required for shale gas development in these provinces.
              It is assumed these policies do not change over the forecast
              period.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Deliverability Outlooks</h3>
          <p>
            The three price cases cover a range, however in all three cases the
            North American natural gas market is expected to remain amply
            supplied.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the Mid-Range Price Case, the market remains oversupplied with
              deliverability relatively flat in 2015 and declining in 2016. By
              2017, increasing demand pushes the market further towards a
              balanced position creating higher prices and providing an
              incentive for a slight increase in Western Canadian production.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the Higher Price Case, increased demand tightens the market
              earlier and higher prices encourage enough drilling that
              deliverability rises throughout the forecast. The Higher Price
              Case also sees increased drilling activity to confirm
              deliverability for a proposed LNG project on Canada&rsquo;s West
              Coast.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the Lower Price Case, Western Canadian natural gas faces
              greater competition from U.S. sources with more Canadian gas
              squeezed out of the Eastern U.S. and central Canadian markets.
              Lower prices and a reduced market opportunity decrease Canadian
              deliverability. A comparison of the three Canadian natural gas
              deliverability outlooks to 2017 is shown in Figure 3.1.

            The levels of drilling activity that provides these deliverability
            outcomes are the result of capital investment assumptions and
            estimated drilling costs. Comparisons of natural gas drilling
            activity in the three cases in terms of drill days and gas-intent
            wells drilled are shown in Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3, respectively.

          <h4>Mid-Range Price Case</h4>
          <p>
            The Mid-Range Price Case would see mild growth in Canadian and U.S.
            natural gas demand. The North American market would remain
            oversupplied in 2015 both in terms of NGLs and marketable natural
            gas, resulting in slimmer margins for producers, and lower revenues
            for drilling operations. Difficulties obtaining debt financing for
            Canadian producers would ease somewhat, however private equity
            investment would remain more prominent in the U.S. relative to
            Canada. The outlook for Canadian LNG would remain ambiguous with no
            FID&rsquo;s made before 2016. By 2016 drilling activity begins to
            increase as market conditions begin to improve.
          </p>
          <p><em>Deliverability Results</em></p>
          <p>
            In the Mid-Range Price Case, Canadian natural gas deliverability
            will continue to be well above Canadian demand<sup id="fn11-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn11"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>11</a
              ></sup
            >. Western Canada deliverability falls in 2016 before increasing in
            2017 as gas-directed activity increases with a continued focus on
            higher productivity wells. Tight gas activity grows over the
            projection with 901 tight gas wells drilled in Western Canada in
            2017 including 544 in the Montney tight gas play. The Duvernay Shale
            play continues to see most Canadian shale gas activity with 40 wells
            drilled in 2017, compared to five wells in the Horn River Basin;
            activity in this dry-gas resource could increase if additional
            markets emerge in Canada and the U.S., or if activity increases in
            preparation for LNG exports. A summary of the Mid-Range Price Case
            is available in Table&nbsp;3.2.

          <p><em>Implications</em></p>
          <p>
            Canadian and U.S. gas markets have been well supplied at
            historically moderate prices for the past few years. Markets could
            tighten somewhat due to drilling reductions, rising natural gas
            demand from improved integration of the Mexican market, and growing
            LNG operations in the U.S.
          </p>
          <h4>Higher Price Case</h4>
          <p>
            The Higher Price Case includes a larger recovery for Canadian
            natural gas deliverability due to higher gas demand and less
            displacement of Canadian gas by U.S. supplies. Despite rising
            natural gas prices, power generators prefer natural gas over coal in
            specific markets, potentially to meet stricter environmental
            regulations or to better match variations in the electricity demand
            profile. Canadian producers are able to obtain capital more easily
            while continuing to focus drilling efforts on highly productive
            prospects. Moreover, a FID is assumed to be announced in 2016 for a
            LNG project on the West Coast of Canada, which adds additional
            drilling to prove reserves.  Finally, harsher weather conditions
            could provide additional demand. This results in a closer balance
            between deliverability and demand before the end of the projection
            period.
          </p>
          <p><em>Deliverability Results</em></p>
          <p>
            Canadian natural gas deliverability grows continuously over the
            projection under the higher price case increasing from
            416&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.7&nbsp;Bcf/d) in 2014 to
            441&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (15.6&nbsp;Bcf/d) by 2017.
            Tight gas production is still the primary source of new production
            growing from 249&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (7.1&nbsp;Bcf/d)
            in 2014 to 315&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (8.9&nbsp;Bcf/d)
            in 2017. A summary of the Higher Price Case is available in
            Table&nbsp;3.3.

          <p><em>Implications</em></p>
          <p>
            Higher prices, increased demand, and improved competitiveness of
            Canadian gas relative to the U.S. keep deliverability increasing
            over the projection. The supply overhang experienced in the North
            American market over the past few years will continue, but
            conditions will begin to tighten as additional sources of demand
            become available and drilling takes place to meet it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Lower Price Case, demand for Canadian natural gas is assumed
            to decrease due to mild weather, modest economic growth, and ongoing
            displacement by growing supplies of U.S. natural gas. Canadian
            producers would have difficulty obtaining debt financing while
            private equity investment would occur almost exclusively in the U.S.
            Canadian natural gas deliverability would continue to be more than
            adequate to meet domestic demand. The Lower Price case would also
            assume that a FID for Canadian LNG projects are delayed and
            resulting activities to confirm reserves and deliverability for LNG
            exports are scaled back.
          </p>
          <p><em>Deliverability Results</em></p>
          <p>
            Canadian natural gas deliverability decreases slightly in 2015 to
            415&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.6&nbsp;Bcf/d) before
            falling significantly in 2016 to
            397&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.0&nbsp;Bcf/d) and further
            in 2017 to 394 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (13.9&nbsp;Bcf/d).
            Lower natural gas prices reduce investment in the sector. A summary

          <p>
            Canadian natural gas consumers would benefit from lower natural gas
            prices in the short term. This case shows the greatest decline in
            natural gas deliverability which would result in a significant
            reduction in drilling and other gas-related service activities. Even
            in the lower oil price environment, oil-related activity might be
            able to partially compensate for reduced natural gas operations to
            help support ongoing Canadian drilling and service activity.

            is that the storage deficit following the unusually cold winter of
            2013-2014 encouraged significantly higher deliverability than was
            projected. The higher deliverability was due to additional drilling
            undertaken to refill storage, higher well productivity than expected
            and additional production from activity to prove reserves for
            potential LNG export. With adequate storage and mild demand growth,
            the supply overhang in the North American natural gas market has
            intensified.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest development in the market since the 2014 projection was
            the major decline in oil prices. The lower price environment has
            producers facing tighter capital constraints and has also made
            obtaining debt financing more difficult. Reduced revenues from a
            glut of NGLs in the market and lower NGL prices are expected to
            reduce the amount of drilling for liquids-rich natural gas. These
            combined factors have decreased drilling and service activities but
            have also lowered service costs and improved capital efficiency on a
            per-well basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Alberta Reference Price in 2014 was $4.27/GJ, well above the
            $3.43/GJ projected in the Mid-range Price Case and even above the
            $4.05/GJ projected in the Higher Price Case. As a result, actual
            production averaged 416&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d
            (14.7&nbsp;Bcf/d) of marketable natural gas in 2014, nearer to the
            Board&rsquo;s Higher Price Case projection of
            414&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>/d (14.6&nbsp;Bcf/d). Actual
            production, higher than what was projected, can be attributed to
            prices and well productivity being higher than expected, along with
            additional production from activity directed at confirming reserves
            for potential LNG export.

          <p>
            Developments that will influence future Canadian natural gas
            deliverability include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The development of a Canadian LNG market remains an uncertainty in
              the years ahead. A FID could increase Canadian natural gas
              deliverability, though the construction of facilities would only
              occur beyond the projection period. It is likely that a
              significant portion of natural gas destined to be exported as LNG
              will be produced from supplies developed in direct response to the
              project. Prior to export, these sources of gas would need to be
              proven and their production would likely be sold into the North
              American market.
            </li>
            <li>
              The developing glut of NGLs and the subsequent decrease in NGL
              prices, along with lower oil prices, may reduce NGL and
              oil-targeted drilling which results in natural gas being produced
              as a byproduct. It is possible that reduced production would help
              balance markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Acquisition and consolidation of smaller North American producers
              by major companies could result in more coordinated production
              efforts. Moreover, the economies of scale achieved by integrating
              into supply chains of major companies could significantly reduce
              costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rate at which Canadian natural gas is squeezed from markets in
              central Canada and the U.S. has major implications for future
              Canadian deliverability. The timing and utilization of additional
              pipeline capacity from the Marcellus and Utica to the U.S. Midwest
              will be a key factor affecting markets that have made extensive
              use of Canadian natural gas.
            </li>
            <li>
              NGL-rich gas from the Montney is some of the lowest cost gas in
              North America and can be competitive with Marcellus gas in certain
              markets depending on relative transportation costs and foreign
              exchange rates. There is potential for increased future
              deliverability from the Montney despite lower gas prices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Technological advancements, efficiency gains and improved data
              analytics in drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations have
              improved the economics of North American natural gas production.
              Inputs including labour and materials have seen cost rollbacks in
              response to lower activity levels. Depending on the economics of
              the individual producer, improvements in these economic factors
              may contribute to increased deliverability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of Canadian oil sands projects in 2016-2017 will
              impact the demand for Canadian natural gas. Natural gas is used as
              a major fuel source to provide energy for oil sands operations.
              Oil sands projects under construction and scheduled to begin
              production between 2015 and 2018 are generally considered
              sufficiently advanced to be completed despite lower oil prices.
              Projects in early stages of planning or development may be
              postponed until global oil markets become more supportive.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 2015 natural gas storage refill is ahead of schedule in
              producing areas, but remains depleted in central Canadian and
              north-central U.S. regions. The pace of storage refill over the
              summer and fall will be a telling indicator of the extent to which
              natural gas production is exceeding demand. Should the storage
              refill get too far ahead of schedule, natural gas prices may
              decline. This could increase coal-to-gas switching in power
              generation markets to help absorb the gas surplus. Conversely, a
              warmer than average summer may draw more natural gas into power
              generation to run air conditioners and slow the pace of storage
              injections, subsequently increasing natural gas prices and
              encouraging the growth of natural gas deliverability.

                  Deliverability is the estimated amount of gas supply available
                  from a given area based on historical production and
                  inasideidual well declines, as well as projected activity. Gas
                  production may be less than deliverability due to a number of
                  factors, such as weather-related supply interruptions, and
                  shut-in production due to insufficient demand, economic or
                  strategic considerations.

                  NGLs are liquid hydrocarbons including ethane, propane,
                  butanes, and pentanes plus. Natural gas containing commercial
                  amounts of NGLs is known as NGL-rich, liquids-rich or wet gas.
                  Dry natural gas contains little or no NGLs. Gas produced from
                  oil wells includes gas in solution within the oil (solution
                  gas) and gas adjacent to the oil within the reservoir
                  (associated gas). Production of solution gas and associated
                  gas is almost entirely dictated by oil operations, and is
                  typically not influenced by natural gas market conditions.

<p id="amortization"><strong>Amortization:</strong> The gradual writing-off of an asset or debt over a fixed period of time.</p>
<p id="apigravity"><strong>API gravity:</strong> The American Petroleum Institute gravity, or API gravity, express the gravity or density for liquid petroleum products. It is a measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water: if its API gravity is greater than 10&nbsp;degrees, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. The lower the API gravity, the heavier and more viscous the bitumen. Most crude oils have a gravity below 45&nbsp;degrees.</p>
<p id="apportionment"><strong>Apportionment:</strong> When shippers nominate more oil, or oil product, in a given month than the pipeline is able to transport, shipper volumes are apportioned (reduced) based on the tariff in effect. Apportionment can be driven by several factors, including growing oil supply, increased oil demand, and reduced pipeline capacity.</p>
<p id="atlanticbasin"><strong>Atlantic Basin:</strong> Refers to countries residing beside or within the Atlantic Ocean and its related waters.</p>
<p id="atmosphericdistillation"><strong>Atmospheric Distillation:</strong> The first processing unit in practically all refineries.

These products (naphtha, gasoil, and long residue) are further processed at other refinery units.</p>
<p id="asphaltproduction"><strong>Asphalt Production:</strong> Asphalt is produced using the heaviest product (residual or short residue) sourced from the bottom of a vacuum distillation tower. Asphalt is used primarily for road construction and roofing.</p>
<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2 id="B" class="h1 text-primary">B</h2>

<p id="battery"><strong>Battery:</strong> With respect to electricity a battery is a container consisting of one or more cells, in which chemical energy is converted into electricity and used as a source of power. In the oil and gas industry, a battery refers to a system of tanks or surface equipment that receives natural gas or&nbsp;oil from one or more wells prior to delivery to downstream pipelines or other disposition. A battery may include equipment for separating, measuring or storing oil, gas and water.</p>
<p id="bidirectionalpipeline"><strong>Bi-directional pipeline:</strong> Gas or liquids pipeline systems that are capable of flowing product in both directions.

<p id="capacitypipelines"><strong>Capacity (Pipelines):</strong> The maximum amount of hydrocarbons that a pipeline can transport over a period of time. For a natural gas pipeline, daily capacity will vary depending on ambient temperature. For an oil pipeline, capacity will vary depending upon the specific grade of oil being transported.</p>
<p id="capandtradeprograms"><strong>Cap and Trade Programs:</strong> A cap-and-trade system limits the total level of specified pollutants that can be emitted in a given jurisdiction. Emissions allowances are allocated by various means to polluters which are required to hold permits for their emissions. A market for emission permits is established and market forces act to determine a price for those permits. The benefit of such a system is those that can reduce their emissions at a cost that is lower than the permit price will choose to do so. Those for whom it is more expensive to reduce emissions will prefer to purchase a permit, meaning emission reductions are achieved in an economically efficient manner.</p>
<p id="capital"><strong>Capital:</strong> The total funds invested in a company by lenders (debt capital) and by owners (equity capital).</p>
<p id="carboncaptureandstorage"><strong>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon capture and sequestration:</strong> A method of capturing and storing CO<sub>2</sub> so that it is not released into the atmosphere, thereby reducing GHG emissions. The CO2is compressed into a transportable form, moved by pipeline or tanker, and stored in some medium, such as a deep geological formation.</p>
<p id="carbonppricing"><strong>Carbon pricing:</strong> Carbon pricing is a means of attaching a cost to the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent into the atmosphere. There are two main types of carbon pricing: a carbon tax applied to the carbon content of fossil fuels and a cap-and-trade system. Carbon pricing improves the relative competitiveness of renewable energy sources compared to fossil fuel sources.</p>
<p id="catalyticcracking"><strong>Catalytic Cracking:</strong> A secondary crude oil refining process where a catalytic agent is used to break down larger heavier, less valuable hydrocarbons such as vacuum gas oil or resid into lighter, higher-value products (gasoline and diesel). It is one of the most important conversion processes in a refinery, allowing it to increase the production of light products at refineries.</p>
<p id="catalyticreforming"><strong>Catalytic Reforming:</strong> A refining process involving heat, pressure and catalysts in order to convert low octane naphtha from crude oil distillation into high-octane reformate, a premium component for gasoline blending and petrochemical feedstocks. High purity hydrogen is produced as a by-product which can be used for other refinery processes.</p>
<p id="co2flooding"><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> flooding:</strong> CO<sub>2</sub> flooding is a process of enhanced oil recovery, in which carbon dioxide is injected into oil-bearing reservoirs increasing the amount of oil that can be extracted.</p>
<p id="coalbedmethane"><strong>Coalbed methane (CBM):</strong> Natural gas that is trapped within coal seams. CBM production is considered unconventional because the gas is adsorbed within the coal (i.e., the gas is stuck to the sides of coal’s pore spaces and fractures) and can only be desorbed and flow into a well by first lowering pressures.</p>
<p id="cogeneration"><strong>Cogeneration:</strong> Production of electricity and another form of useful thermal energy, such as heat or steam, from the same energy source. The byproduct heat from industrial processes can either be used to power an electrical generator, or can be used for industrial purposes.</p>
<p id="coke"><strong>Coke:</strong> A carbon-rich solid that is created when heavy crude oil (including bitumen) is heated to high temperatures to crack it into lighter oils and natural gas liquids. Also, a carbon-rich solid that is created when coal is heated to high temperatures in an airless oven to drive off any water, gas, and coal tar inside the coal. Coke is largely burned in blast furnaces during the smelting of steel.</p>
<p id="coker"><strong>Coker:</strong> Takes the lowest value bottoms material from the petroleum refining process and cracks it to the point where the remaining yielding consists of only lighter fractions and solid carbon.</p>
<p id="coking"><strong>Coking:</strong> When high temperatures are applied to heavy crude oil (including bitumen) to crack it into lighter oils and natural gas liquids while also creating a solid, carbon-rich byproduct called coke.  Also, when coal is baked in an airless oven at high temperatures so that the any water, gas, and coal tar inside the coal is driven off and a solid, carbon-rich product called coke remains.</p>
<p id="condensate"><strong>Condensate:</strong> A liquid like a very light oil, but is extracted from natural gas production. Condensate can be produced at gas wells and at natural gas processing plants (where it is also known as pentanes plus).</p>
<p id="conventionalcrudeoil"><strong>Conventional crude oil:</strong> Crude oil that can flow into a well at commercial rates without the extensive use of technology after the well is drilled, and without altering the natural viscosity of the oil.</p>
<p id="conventionalnaturalgas"><strong>Conventional natural gas:</strong> Natural gas that can flow into a well at commercial rates without the extensive use of technology after the well is drilled.</p>
<p id="donversionorcrackingrefineries"><strong>Conversion or Cracking Refineries:</strong> Includes the processes in a Hydroskimming Refinery plus catalytic cracking and/or hydrocracking units. These conversion processes transform heavy products from distillation (mostly heavy gas oil) into lighter products, suitable for gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel production and petrochemical feedstock. Conversion refineries are able to increase the yield of light, high-value products from the crude oil processed at the refinery.</p>
<p id="coolingdegreedays"><strong>Cooling Degree Days (CDD):</strong> CDD is an index that represents cooling demand for homes, businesses, etc. CDD is the cumulative number of days in a year for which the mean temperature is above a base temperature. In Canada, Environment Canada uses 18&nbsp;degrees Celsius and others use 15.4 or 15.4&nbsp;degrees Celsius as a benchmark. In the US, the base temperature is often 60 or 65&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit (16 or 18&nbsp;degrees Celsius respectively).</p>
<p id="costofservice"><strong>Cost of Service:</strong> The total cost of providing service, including operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation, amortization, taxes, and return on rate base. For cost of service pipelines, it is approximately the same as its revenue requirement &ndash; see <a href="#revenuerequirement"><strong>Revenue Requirement</strong></a>.</p>
<p id="costreductionpolicies"><strong>Cost Reduction Policies:</strong> Policies which reduce the cost of renewable projects. Such programs include government loan guarantees which reduce finance costs by mitigating risk to the lender as well as tax breaks for renewable projects.</p>
<p id="crowncorporation"><strong>Crown corporation:</strong> An enterprise that is wholly owned by the federal or provincial government, and ultimately by the Sovereign of Canada. Crown corporations are established by an act of legislation. Crown corporations can operate at arm’s length, or partially independently, from the government.</p>
<p id="crudeoil"><strong>Crude oil:</strong> A mixture of liquid hydrocarbons in underground reservoirs that remains liquid at atmospheric pressure and temperature. Crude oil may contain small amounts of sulphur and other non-hydrocarbons, but it does not include liquids obtained from the processing of natural gas. It is refined into a variety of petroleum products including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and petrochemicals which are used to make many consumer and industrial products.</p>
<p id="cyclicsteamstimulation"><strong>Cyclic steam stimulation (CSS):</strong> A thermal process to produce in-situ bitumen. Steam is injected into the reservoir through a well over a period of several months, decreasing the bitumen’s viscosity. Later, the steam is turned off and the emulsion of water and bitumen flows back into the well over a period of several months. The process is repeated for the economic life of the well.</p>

<h2 id="V" class="h1 text-primary">V</h2>
<p id="vacuumdistillation"><strong>Vacuum Distillation:</strong> The process of further distilling the heavy products (long residue) left over from atmospheric distillation. Vacuum distillation occurs at a very low pressure, reducing the boiling temperature for heavy compounds. Products from vacuum distillation (vacuum gas oil and residual or resid) are further processed by other refinery units. Residual is used at refineries for asphalt or heavy fuel oil production or as feedstock for coking units.</p>
<p id="variablecosts"><strong>Variable Costs:</strong> Costs that vary with throughput, such as compressor fuel costs for gas pipelines and power costs for oil pipelines &ndash; see <a href="#fixedcosts"><strong>Fixed costs</strong></a>.</p>
<p id="variablecostofservicetoll"><strong>Variable Cost-of-Service Toll:</strong> A toll which varies from month to month to reflect actual costs and throughput. Rules prescribed by the regulator specify which costs can be recovered, the accounting principles to be followed in determining the costs, the rate of return allowed on the investment in rate base, depreciation rates, and other parameters &ndash; see <a href="#fixedtoll"><strong>Fixed toll</strong></a>.</p>
<p id="variablerenewableelectricity"><strong>Variable Renewable Electricity (VRE):</strong> Non-dispatchable electricity that is generated from intermittent sources such as solar and wind energy.</p>
<p id="viscosityreduction"><strong>Viscosity Reduction:</strong> A refinery process that reduces the viscosity of a residual or heavy crude oil. Viscosity reduction is achieved either by partially cracking the residual in a furnace (visbreaking) or by adding a diluent (light oil, naphtha, kerosene or other distillates).</p>

<h2 id="W" class="h1 text-primary">W</h2>
<p id="wasteheat"><strong>Waste heat:</strong> Energy lost during the operation of a piece of equipment or machinery. Various processes, such as cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP) exist to capture and reuse waste heat.</p>
<p id="westtexasintermediate"><strong>West Texas Intermediate (WTI):</strong> A key North American benchmark crude oil price, it’s a light sweet grade of crude oil produced in western Texas with an API gravity of 40&nbsp;degrees. It is priced at Cushing, Oklahoma and is the deliverable grade for the New York Mercantile Exchange’s oil futures contract.</p>
<p id="westerncanadasedimentarybasin"><strong>Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB):</strong> The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) is an ancient sedimentary basin 1.4&nbsp;million square kilometres in size that formed over southwest Manitoba, southern Saskatchewan, almost all of Alberta, eastern and northeastern British Columbia, and the southern Yukon and Northwest Territories. It is the major oil and gas producing region of Canada.</p>
<p id="westerncanadianselect"><strong>Western Canadian Select (WCS):</strong> A blend of Canadian heavy and bitumen sour crude oils mixed with sweet synthetic and condensates with an API gravity of about 21&nbsp;degrees. It is priced at Hardisty, Alberta and is often used as a representative price for Canadian heavy crude oils.</p>
<p id="windpower"><strong>Wind power:</strong> Energy produced when wind moves the propeller or fan style blades and rotates the turbine. This spins the shaft which is connected to a generator. Horizontal axis wind turbines are the most common type.</p>
<p id="workingcapital"><strong>Working Capital:</strong> For regulatory purposes, capital employed by the utility to finance its ongoing operations, in addition to the investment in Plant in Service. An allowance for working capital is included in the rate base and consists of items such as cash working capital and materials and supplies inventory.</p>
<p id="writeoff"><strong>Write Off:</strong> The elimination of the recorded amount of an asset or liability for reasons other than the occurrence of a transaction.</p>
<p id="wti-wcsdifferential"><strong>WTI-WCS Differential:</strong> The WTI-WCS differential is the price difference between sweet, light crude oil priced at the Cushing, Oklahoma, price hub (WTI) and heavy blends priced at Hardisty, Alberta (WCS). It reflects a quality difference between the heavy-sour WCS and the light-sweet WTI as well as the cost of transportation. Changes in the WTI-WCS differential can arise for a number of reasons including relative changes in refinery demand for heavy crude or a change in the cost of transportation between the two markets.</p>

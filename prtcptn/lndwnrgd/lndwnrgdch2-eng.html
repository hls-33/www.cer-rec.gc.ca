                a public hearing for pipeline projects that are less than 40
                kilometres in length. The purpose of a public hearing is to

                from landowners or participants, which the Board finds is
                necessary to make its recommendation. Construction and operation
                of a project cannot begin unless the company has received
                approval from the Board, met all pre-construction conditions and
                obtained the necessary approvals from other government
                departments.

              <h2><a id="q1"></a>How can I participate in a hearing?</h2>
              <p>
                Depending on the process chosen by the NEB for a project’s
                assessment, there are typically three ways that individuals or
                groups may participate in a hearing:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>1) Filing a letter of comment -</strong> a signed,
                written statement about the writer’s views regarding an
                application which may include information to support these views
                and a description of how the writer is connected to or affected
                by the project. A letter of comment must be filed before the
                hearing, as the company and all other parties may refer to it or
                comment on it during the hearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2) Asking to make an oral statement -</strong> similar
                to a letter of comment, but is presented in-person (orally) at a
                public hearing. Anyone wishing to provide an oral statement must
                advise the NEB of their intentions in advance of the public
                hearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3) Applying for intervenor status -</strong> this is the
                most involved level of participation. Intervenors may file
                written evidence, directly receive all documents filed by the
                company and other intervenors, comment on evidence and ask
                questions of all parties involved, and make a final argument.
              </p>

              <div class="well">
                <p>
                  In your application for intervenor status, you must explain
                  why you would like to participate in the hearing and list the
                  specific issues you intend to address at the hearing. The NEB
                  may or may not grant intervenor status to everyone who
                  applies.

                wanting to construct and operate a pipeline which is more than
                40 kilometres long must obtain a certificate by applying for
                approval under section 52. Under this provision, the Board must
                decide whether a project is in the public interest. The public
                interest is inclusive of all Canadians and refers to a balance
                of economic, environmental, and social interests that change as
                society’s values and preferences evolve over time. The Board
                assesses the overall public good a project may create and its
                potential negative aspects, weighs its various impacts, and
                makes a recommendation.

              <p>
                Landowners are strongly encouraged to express concerns to the
                company as soon as they are provided with project information so
                that more time can be devoted to address these issues at the
                company’s project planning stage. If a landowner has concerns
                about the project itself or the general pipeline location, these
                concerns must be made known at the certificate hearing - not at
                a detailed route hearing.

              <p>
                When a company works on its pipeline plan and design, it needs
                to make decisions about how and where to build the pipeline.
                Things such as natural land features, environmentally sensitive
                areas, soil type, and the location of houses, roads or other
                infrastructure will have an influence on the route of the
                pipeline.

                allows a pipeline company to enter lands to survey the proposed
                location of a pipeline or to conduct field studies, examinations
                and other work that is necessary to determine the location of a
                pipeline. For example, if the company knows that there are
                sensitive land features in the area where it wants to build its
                pipeline, it may decide to conduct field studies to see what it
                could do to protect the land features, or if it should avoid the
                area altogether. If the company causes any damage to the
                property as a result of a survey, field study or examination,
                the company is required to compensate the landowner. For more

                What is evidence? Evidence is the legal term for the statements,
                reports, photographs and other materials that participants put
                together to make their case. (includes IR responses) Evidence
                must be shared with all participants and the NEB before the
                hearing. Evidence, and the answers provided on cross-examination
                (if there is an oral portion with cross examination), form part
                of the official record on which the decision or recommendation
                is made. At the hearing, you do not restate the content of your
                evidence but you will be called upon to adopt it under oath.
                Then, you may be questioned about it by other participants.

              <p>
                A Hearing Order provides information on the process the Board
                will use to conduct the hearing, how parties can participate,
                and the schedule of the upcoming hearing. The Hearing Order (or
                another document called a Procedural Update) will usually
                include details about the date(s), location(s), and time(s) of
                the hearing, and issues that will be discussed. A Hearing Order
                can be viewed on the NEB website, and a public notice with the
                Hearing Order information will usually be published in local
                newspapers. Companies may also use additional forms of media
                such as radio or television to advertise hearings.

                The NEB maintains a public record of all the information filed

                from companies, intervenors and commenters is made available to
                the public on the NEB website under “Regulatory Documents”. The
                oral portion of the hearings is also broadcast live on the

                If you are an intervenor, all of your evidence (documentation in
                support of your position) that will be presented at an NEB

                notice that evidence is filed and can be accessed on the NEB’s

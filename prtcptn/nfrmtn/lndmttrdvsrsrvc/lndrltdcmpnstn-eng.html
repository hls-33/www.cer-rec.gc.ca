            The Canada Energy Regulator and Compensation Disputes
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Canada Energy Regulator (CER or Regulator) is a quasi-judicial,
            independent agency that regulates pipelines, international power
            lines, offshore renewable energy, and energy development in the
            Canadian public interest. We promote safety and security,
            environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure and
            markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CER&rsquo;s mandate is set out in legislation, including the
            Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CER Act), the Canada Oil and Gas
            Operations Act, the Canada Petroleum Resources Act, and the Impact
            Assessment Act. The CER oversees safety and environmental protection
            for the full lifecycle of energy facilities – from design and
            application assessment to construction, operation, and abandonment.

            Chapter 2: Options For Resolving a Compensation Dispute
          </h2>
          <h3 id="s21">Negotiation with the Company</h3>
          <p>
            Landowners and companies are encouraged to work together to
            negotiate agreements on compensation (including impacts of
            construction, such as damages) and the size and location of the land
            rights required for the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CER expects all interested parties to first attempt to resolve
            compensation disputes amongst themselves before bringing a
            compensation dispute to the CER.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s22">CER Resolution Options</h3>
          <p>
            If parties are unable to resolve a compensation dispute through
            their own negotiation efforts, the CER can support the resolution of
            the dispute in two ways: Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) or
            Adjudication (Hearing and Decision).

                      ADR is an interest-based, confidential way for landowners,
                      Indigenous peoples, and other land users to resolve
                      disputes throughout the lifecycle of a project with
                      CER-regulated companies. It includes negotiation,
                      facilitation and mediation.

                      The CER encourages parties to use ADR to resolve issues to
                      explore and understand interests, and develop acceptable
                      solutions where possible.

          <h3 id="s23">Accessing CER Resolution Processes</h3>
          <p>
            The first step in requesting the CER&rsquo;s support to resolve a
            compensation dispute is to contact the CER with details of the
            dispute using one of two forms available on the CER website:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For ADR, a Complaint Form must be completed and submitted to the
              CER. The form and ADR process are further described in Chapter 3
              of this guide.
            </li>
            <li>
              For a compensation dispute hearing, a Compensation Dispute Hearing
              Application must be completed and submitted to the CER. The
              application and hearing process are further described further in
              Chapter 4 of this guide.
            </li>

          </p>

          <p>
            The CER will contact the sender within 10 calendar days of receipt
            of a Complaint Form or Compensation Dispute Hearing Application to
            confirm receipt and provide information on the next steps.
          </p>

            CER staff are available to answer questions and provide information
            about what ADR and adjudication typically entail in terms of
            process, timelines and amount of effort. They do not make decisions
            regarding the dispute or provide advice on the dispute itself. For

          <p>
            Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a process for parties to
            jointly resolve disputes. The objective of ADR is to ensure a common
            understanding of the facts, and involves examining different options
            with the goal of establishing a mutually agreed upon solution
            outside of or in parallel to an adjudication process.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s31">Goals and Principles of the CER’s ADR Process</h3>
          <p>
            The goals and principles of the CER&rsquo;s ADR process reflect the
            desire of the CER to have a range of dispute resolution processes
            available to develop innovative and satisfactory solutions outside
            of a hearing.<br />
            Goals
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Promote efficiency by achieving resolution outside of an
              adjudication process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Promote a better understanding of the issues and identifying
              common interests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable parties involved to take an active role in resolving the
              dispute.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increase face-to-face discussions between affected parties and
              company decision-makers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Principles</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ADR process will preserve the neutrality of the CER.</li>
            <li>
              The ADR process will be clear, accessible, flexible, and
              responsive to the parties and their needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              ADR can occur without impacting the timing of a regulatory
              decision unless the CER determines otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parties to the ADR process will act in &ldquo;good faith&rdquo;.
              Good faith means that the parties agree to be open-minded,
              respectful, and direct in arriving at a mutual solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Discussions in preliminary-ADR meetings and subsequent mediation
              are confidential and conducted without prejudice unless the
              parties agree otherwise.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="s32">Steps in the CER’s ADR Process</h3>
          <p>
            To request ADR, you must complete and submit a Complaint Form which
            can be found on the
            <a href="/pplctnflng/sbmt/index-eng.html"
              >Submit Applications and Regulatory Documents</a
            >
            page on the CER&rsquo;s website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CER will contact the sender of the form within 10 calendar days
            to confirm receipt and provide information on next steps. If the
            sender consents, the CER will send the complaint to the company and
            request a response.
          </p>
          <p>
            If both parties agree, the CER will then arrange a pre-resolution
            conference for parties involved in the compensation dispute. The
            conference is guided by CER staff and is typically held over the
            phone but could take place face-to-face. Lawyers or other
            representatives are not required, but parties may invite them if
            they wish.
          </p>
          <p>The pre-resolution conference will generally include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              identifying, clarifying and narrowing the issue(s) or complaint;
            </li>
            <li>
              sharing and exchanging information, including documents, about the
              dispute; and,
            </li>
            <li>exploring options available for resolution.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Parties will also discuss timing, location, cost, confidentiality
            and who should participate in the ADR process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the pre-resolution conference, parties can make an
            informed decision on whether to continue with ADR. The CER, in
            consultation with the parties, will draft an &lsquo;Agreement to
            Mediate&rsquo; document that will set out the next steps. Next steps
            include a mediation session with the parties which is typically
            in-person.

              <div class="panel-body">
                <p>
                  Without prejudice means the discussion and disclosures in ADR
                  that do not already form part of the evidentiary record of an
                  ongoing regulatory review process before the CER cannot be
                  used as evidence in any subsequent adjudication process.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </aside>
          <p>
            ADR has its own conventional rules regarding confidentiality,
            without prejudice and sharing of information. CER staff facilitating
            ADR will ensure participating parties adequately discuss and
            understand these topics early in the ADR process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results of the ADR process are not binding. However, any
            resolution or settlement agreed to must conform to all regulatory
            and statutory requirements. Therefore, certain technical,
            scientific, or other information or components of an agreement may
            be disclosed to the CER or other regulatory authorities.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s34">Agreements</h3>
          <p>
            The ADR process may result in parties reaching agreement on
            compensation. The CER does not enforce agreements made through ADR,
            nor are they made public. However, the CER considers it important
            that parties meet commitments, and CER staff will follow up if
            contacted by either party with concerns about the terms of an
            agreement not being honoured.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s35">Costs and Funding</h3>
          <p>
            There is no participant funding available for ADR but typically the
            pipeline company will voluntarily cover reasonable costs.

            Adjudication, or a hearing, is a quasi-judicial process in which the
            Commission hears all the evidence from parties and makes a decision.
            Parties have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments in
            support of their respective positions, and to test the evidence of
            parties in their particular process.

            During a hearing, the CER may also ask pertinent questions about the
            application as it seeks the information it needs to make a
            transparent, fair, and objective decision.<br />

            The CER will announce a hearing and will issue a process letter or a
            document called a Hearing Order. A Hearing Order typically includes
            a brief description of the application, the list of issues that can
            be considered, as well as details on the steps in the hearing
            process and the schedule (timing and deadlines) for the various
            steps. Many hearings are conducted in writing only, however if there
            is an oral step (such as oral cross-examination or oral argument),
            the date, location and time of the oral portion of the hearing may
            be shared if these details are known.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a hearing, a Commissioner or panel of Commissioners will be
            assigned to read and listen to all of the evidence that is filed on
            the application, and may ask questions of the applicant and other
            participants before making a decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, the CER may assign Process Advisors to support the
            public and Indigenous peoples who are participating in hearings to
            answer questions about the CER&rsquo;s hearing process and explain
            the different roles in a hearing. The Hearing Order will include
            information on any resources that are available to assist with
            hearing related questions, including a whether Process Advisors have
            been assigned to the hearing. <strong> </strong>
          </p>
          <h2 id="s43">Role of Commissioners</h2>
          <p>
            A Commissioner, or panel of Commissioners will hear evidence from
            all parties in a compensation dispute and make a decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            A compensation dispute may relate to other matters or hearings under
            consideration by the Commission. For example, a compensation dispute
            may relate to the acquisition of land rights proposed to be required
            by a company in order to build new pipeline facilities. In this
            example, the company may be applying, or may have already applied,
            to the Commission for an Order or Certificate permitting it to
            construct the proposed pipeline facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Commission will normally consider compensation matters
            separately from other related applications, unless it determines
            otherwise.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s44">Decision</h2>
          <p>
            The CER Act sets out the factors that the Commission considers when
            deciding a compensation dispute under Part 6:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              market value of lands;<sup id="fn3-rf"

            <li>
              changes to periodic payments as a result of changes to market
              value of the lands;
            </li>
            <li>
              loss of use as a result of the operation of the prescribed
              area;<sup id="fn4-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"
                  ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a
                ></sup
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              adverse effect of the taking by the company including the
              prescribed area, on the remainder of the lands;
            </li>
            <li>
              nuisance, inconvenience and noise in connection with the
              operations of the company;
            </li>
            <li>damage to lands caused by the operations of the company;</li>
            <li>loss of or damage to livestock or other personal property;</li>
            <li>
              special difficulties in relocation of an owner or their property;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              any other factors that the Commission considers appropriate.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In all cases, the Commission will decide on compensation matters on
            a case by case basis and will rely on evidence submitted by all
            parties regarding the dispute.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the Commission has determined it has all the information it
            needs to makes its decision, it will publicly issue its decision
            with reasons. The Commission may include in its decision, direction
            on the awarding of costs. For more information on costs see the
            section below.

                  Yes. Parties are encouraged to continue to make efforts to
                  resolve the dispute and come to a mutually agreeable outcome
                  even if a hearing process is underway. Should parties reach an
                  agreement and the application is then withdrawn.

                <p>
                  At any time during a compensation proceeding, the parties may
                  continue to discuss and negotiate terms either privately or
                  using the CER&rsquo;s ADR services, and may advise the
                  Commission that a compensation claim or portions thereof have
                  been settled and are withdrawn from the Commission&rsquo;s
                  consideration.

            There are two options if you do not agree with a decision made by
            the Commission - you can file an appeal or you can ask the
            Commission to review its decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decisions made by the Commission may be appealed to Canada's Federal
            Court of Appeal on a point of law or jurisdiction if the Court
            grants permission (or leave) to appeal it. An application asking for
            permission to appeal (known as a leave to appeal application) must
            be filed with the Federal Court of Appeal within 30 days following
            the CER decision<sup id="fn5-rf"

          </p>
          <p>
            The Commission may also be asked to review or alter its own
            decision. Parties involved in the compensation proceeding can ask
            the Commission for a review but only if specific requirements are
            met. These requirements are listed in the National Energy Board
            Rules of Practice and Procedures.<sup id="fn6-rf"

            If the Commission decides to hold a review, it may hold a hearing or
            ask for further input from people interested in the project.

          <h2 id="s46">Costs and Funding</h2>
          <p>
            There is no participant funding available for CER compensation
            hearings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Commission may, and in some cases must, order the company (or
            other party) to pay some or all of an applicant&rsquo;s costs
            incurred for a compensation hearing. After the Commission orders an
            amount of compensation to be paid, the Commission will hear
            additional evidence and argument to determine costs. At that time,
            the Commission will need to know the amount of compensation that was
            offered by the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the amount the Commission awards a person in its compensation
            decision is more than 85% of the amount of compensation offered by
            the company, costs are mandatory; that is, thecompany must pay all
            legal, appraisal and other costs reasonably incurred by that
            person<sup id="fn7-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"
                ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a
              ></sup
            >. If the amount the Commission awards a person in its compensation
            decision is 85% or less of the amount of compensation offered by the
            company, costs are discretionary; that is, the company may be
            ordered by the Commission to pay some or all of the
            applicant&rsquo;s costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In assessing reasonability of costs, the Commission may consider
            factors such as the type of cost, the reasonability of rates, and
            whether the costs incurred resulted in assisting the Commission in
            making its compensation determination. Regardless of whether a cost
            award is mandatory or discretionary, the Commission will consider
            the amount of costs incurred, and whether they were reasonably
            incurred.

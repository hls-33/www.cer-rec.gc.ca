                The guidance provided in this document is based on the National
                Energy Board Act, which applies to federally regulated pipelines
                and power line companies. Provincial jurisdictions will rely
                upon the legislation of the province and may differ. Land
                acquisition agreements will comply with regulatory requirements
                and other elements will vary depending on the company’s
                policies, which province the lands are located in, and the
                unique features of those lands.

                to obtain independent legal advice to aid in interpretations of
                agreement terms and conditions. Landowners are encouraged to
                review and fully understand what wording is included in their
                agreement. If there is any wording that is not clear, ask the
                company for further explanation. Landowners may also consider
                contacting a local landowner, surface rights group, or farmer
                advocacy group.

                  is constructed, if a company requires the use of private lands
                  for its project, it negotiates a land acquisition agreement,
                  frequently referred to as an easement or right-of-way
                  agreement. A company representative, usually a land agent,
                  consults directly with affected landowners to negotiate this
                  agreement. The National Energy Board Act (NEB Act) has legal
                  requirements about how landowners must be notified that their
                  land is required and what required subject matters must be
                  included in a land acquisition agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The agreement will usually contain a clause about how long it
                  remains in effect. A company usually keeps its right to use
                  the land indefinitely unless it abandons the facility and
                  releases (terminates) its easement rights. The National Energy
                  Board (NEB) through a hearing process, will ultimately
                  determine how a pipeline will be abandoned (i.e., left in the
                  ground or removed). At that time, the NEB will consider the
                  evidence filed, and determine the safest, most secure option
                  for the pipeline’s abandonment, as required by the NEB Act.

              </p>
              <p>
                Until a company removes the easement from the land title or
                deed, or it is removed by an order of the court, the land
                remains subject to the easement agreement. The company, the
                landowner that signed the easement agreement and all future
                owners of that property (whether they buy the property or
                inherit it) must abide by the terms of the easement agreement
                until it is terminated and removed from title.

                This document will cover at a high level what landowners can
                expect a company to discuss with them when negotiating a land
                acquisition agreement, what the NEB expects companies to include
                in its land acquisition agreements and the resources available
                to help with negotiations. The purpose of this document is to
                provide landowners with an idea of what to expect during the
                land acquisition process and where they can get further
                assistance if needed.

              <h2 id="s2">Importance of Relationships</h2>
              <p>
                When first approached by a pipeline or power company about a
                proposed project, landowners may be anxious or already worried
                about what might happen or if they will be treated fairly. The
                land agent is normally the first person that the landowner
                encounters during the consultation and negotiation process. The
                land agent should provide landowners with project specific
                information and ensure they have the necessary details in order
                to feel informed. This is also an initial opportunity for
                landowners to share information on site specific details and
                concerns pertaining to their lands. Open communication and
                information-sharing by both parties throughout the consultation
                process is very important for the establishment of a positive
                relationship. Landowners can take time to review the documents,
                seek assistance, ask questions and further educate themselves
                before making any decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important for a landowner to put time and effort into
                understanding information, asking questions, and raising
                potential concerns early on, or when they arise.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the event a landowner and a company need assistance in
                negotiating an agreement, either party may access the NEB’s
                Alternative Dispute Resolution program to help reach a mutually
                acceptable agreement. Alternative Dispute Resolution is a
                voluntary process that occurs separately and independently from
                the NEB’s regulatory processes. The NEB can work with both the
                landowner and the company to initiate a process designed with
                them and tailored for their specific situation to resolve any
                range of outstanding concerns. Natural Resources Canada’s
                Pipeline Arbitration Secretariat is available to address
                unresolved compensation matters.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vast majority of land acquisition agreements result from
                successful negotiations between landowners and companies.
                Landowners and companies are encouraged to work together to
                negotiate an agreement on the compensation (including for
                impacts of construction, such as damages) and the size and the
                location of the land rights required for the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once constructed, the pipeline or power line will usually be
                there for a long time and so it is important that this lengthy
                relationship is started on a solid foundation. The NEB is
                responsible to oversee the continued safe operation of energy
                infrastructure. The NEB has Complaint Resolution programs and,
                as mentioned above, Alternative Dispute Resolution programs to
                assist the company and landowners as needed.

              <p>
                The NEB Act requires a company to formally deliver (serve) a
                notice on all owners of the lands needed for the construction of
                a project. This notice may be provided to the landowner even
                before a project application is filed with the Board and must be
                made before lands are acquired. The landowner may be asked to
                sign a receipt of notice to confirm that they have received the
                notice.
              </p>
              <p>
                The notice must include information on the five points described
                below in order to comply with the requirements of the NEB Act.
                When reviewing the company’s project application, the Board will
                confirm that the sample notice and agreements the company
                proposes to use for its project follow the requirements in the
                NEB Act.

                  Companies must provide a legal description of the lands
                  proposed to be affected by the project. A drawing or survey
                  plan of the lands is usually included, along with a short

                  Companies must provide details of the compensation offered for
                  the lands required. This will include options for payment,
                  which can be either as a lump sum or in periodic payments. The
                  landowner selects whether to accept compensation in one lump

                  subject to review every five&nbsp;years.

                  Companies must provide a statement of the value of the lands
                  required. When determining the compensation amount, companies
                  will generally consider market value, appraisals or property
                  assessments, and recent sales of comparable properties in the
                  area. The calculation of compensation can depend upon a
                  variety of factors and will vary from province to province and
                  company to company. Landowners can ask questions about how the
                  amount was calculated or for other factors to be considered in
                  the amount and very often the amounts can be negotiated.

                  <br />
                  For most projects that require a public hearing, the company
                  must follow the detailed route approval process. This is a
                  decision-making process separate from the public hearing
                  process and is used to determine the project’s specific route,
                  timing and methods of construction within the assessed area.
                  However, for some projects, the company may request an
                  exemption from this requirement for a detailed routing process
                  when it makes its application to the Board for the project.
                  Landowners should identify any impacts relating to the
                  proposed location, methods, and timing of construction of the
                  pipeline or power line so that these matters are considered in
                  the Board’s decision process for the project.<br />
                  <br />Regardless of whether the project is subject to a
                  detailed route process or not, the NEB Act requires companies
                  to provide a description of the NEB’s regulatory process for
                  approval of the detailed route of the pipeline or power line
                  within the notice.

                <h2 id="s6">Rights of the Company</h2>
                <p>
                  The company will seek specific rights it has determined it
                  requires in order to install, operate, maintain, and abandon
                  its facilities. The company’s rights will be reflected in its
                  proposed form of land acquisition agreement. Therefore, by
                  signing this agreement, the landowner is giving their consent
                  to these rights.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  <strong>Typical land acquisition agreements outline:</strong>
                </h3>
                <h4>
                  Companies’ right to construct, operate and maintain the
                  pipeline or power line
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The NEB Act gives the company the right to construct, operate
                  and maintain its pipeline or power line. Companies may expand
                  this to describe their understanding of “construct, operate
                  and maintain”.
                </p>
                <h4>Commodity transported within the pipeline</h4>
                <p>
                  In a land agreement, the type of commodity may not be
                  specified, rather, generic terms may be used such as “oil,
                  other liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons”. However, when a
                  company applies to the NEB to build a pipeline, it must state
                  the commodity (such as oil, natural gas) to be transported
                  within the pipeline. The NEB’s assessment process will
                  consider and specify, among other things, the commodity
                  allowed to be transported in the pipeline. In the future, if
                  the company wants to change the type of commodity, it must
                  apply to the NEB for authorization to do so.
                </p>
                <h4>Access</h4>
                <p>
                  Through the rights negotiated and conveyed in a land
                  acquisition agreement, a company can access the right-of-way
                  for activities relating to the construction, operation, and
                  maintenance of the pipeline or power line. Some agreements may
                  specify how the company can access the right-of-way (e.g., by
                  using a specific, pre-determined route) and what vehicles or
                  equipment may be used (e.g., a truck). Companies and
                  landowners should communicate in advance to discuss the timing
                  and nature of the work to be performed and access.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the event of an emergency, a company can access all lands
                  as required, not only the right-of-way, to respond to and
                  manage the emergency. Companies must compensate landowners for
                  any resulting damages.
                </p>
                <h4>Administrative matters</h4>
                <p>
                  It is common for companies to include administrative
                  information in land acquisition agreements to clarify what
                  will happen in the event of a sale, lien or other changes to
                  land ownership. Companies will also include the right to
                  assign or convey the land rights contained in the easement to
                  another company. This would occur when the pipeline or power
                  line is sold either with all the other assets of the company
                  or on its own as part of a system.
                </p>
                <h4>Abandonment</h4>
                <p>
                  A company must apply to the NEB to abandon a pipeline. At that
                  time, the NEB will assess the company’s application requesting
                  to either leave the pipeline in place or remove it. The NEB
                  will decide whether the company’s proposed method is
                  appropriate, based on the technical information in the
                  application, the company’s consultations with landowners, the
                  company’s and landowners’ preference, evidence filed by
                  interested parties, as well as any implications on safety and
                  the environment and any other factors that the Board
                  determines it needs to assess.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The company and the landowner may negotiate abandonment during
                  the easement negotiation process and may note their respective
                  preferences. The Board must determine, in a public hearing,
                  whether, and upon which conditions a pipeline can be
                  abandoned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the NEB determines that the pipeline can be removed, it
                  will include conditions to promote the safe abandonment of the
                  pipeline and the right-of-way is reclaimed and returned to a
                  state comparable with its surroundings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a pipeline is abandoned in place (not removed), the company
                  will continue to be responsible for the pipeline and
                  right-of-way and the NEB will continue to provide regulatory
                  oversight.

                <h2 id="s7">Damage Prevention Regulations</h2>
                <p>
                  As a federal regulator of international and interprovincial
                  pipelines, the NEB promotes safe work practices around
                  pipelines. The NEB does this through the Damage Prevention
                  Regulations (DPR) and by monitoring and enforcing compliance
                  with those regulations. The NEB promotes public awareness
                  about safety by providing information about regulatory
                  requirements and encouraging co-operation, safety education,
                  and compliance with requirements. Landowners should ensure
                  they are familiar with the DPR before finalizing an easement
                  agreement with the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The restrictions on land use as required by the DPR on the
                  landowner’s activities can often be reduced or eliminated
                  through commitments by landowners and the company if discussed
                  and understood at the time of negotiation.

                <h2 id="s8">Additional Provisions</h2>
                <p>
                  As with any contractual agreement, the terms and conditions
                  within the land acquisition agreement can be negotiated before
                  signing. This means things may be added to or taken out of the
                  draft agreement provided by the company. It also means that
                  more explanation can be provided using simple language within
                  the agreement after the legal clauses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to the required NEB Act provisions identified
                  above, companies may include details on some of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A list of the rights of the landowner and the company under
                    the land acquisition agreement
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  <li>

                <h2 id="s9">Right of Entry</h2>
                <p>
                  In the event a landowner and a company do not finalize a land
                  agreement, the company can apply for a right of entry order
                  from the NEB. A right of entry order gives the company the
                  right to enter a landowner’s property for the purpose of any
                  or all of construction, operation and maintenance of an
                  approved pipeline or power line. The company’s application
                  will include proposed terms and conditions that it requests
                  the Board include with an order, and may or may not directly
                  reflect what had been discussed with the landowner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In assessing a company’s request for an order, the NEB will
                  consider what is submitted both by the company and the
                  landowner in response to the application and then make a
                  decision whether to grant the right of entry order and if so,
                  under what terms and conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the NEB decides to grant the right of entry order, the
                  company does not take ownership of the land. As with an
                  easement agreement, a landowner is entitled to receive an
                  advance of compensation from the company before the company
                  enters the lands. If the landowner disagrees with the amount
                  of compensation offered by the company, either the landowner
                  or the company may contact Natural Resources Canada’s Pipeline
                  Arbitration Secretariat or request support from the NEB’s
                  independent Alternative Dispute Resolution services.

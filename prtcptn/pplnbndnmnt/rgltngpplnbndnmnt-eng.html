<h2 id="s1">1 Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The National Energy Board  (NEB) regulates interprovincial and international pipelines in the Canadian public interest. Our goals  include keeping facilities safe and secure, protecting the environment, and respecting Canadians&rsquo; rights and interests.</p>
<p>In 2009, the NEB conducted  consultation on landowner concerns and generated a report, in part identifying  the need for clarification on how pipeline abandonment is monitored. This  document has been prepared in response to this need.</p>
<p>The NEB has a comprehensive  compliance program for regulating facilities throughout a pipeline&rsquo;s lifecycle.  We hold companies accountable to the public during construction, post-  construction, operation and abandonment.</p>
<p>The NEB&rsquo;s role in making  sure companies take proper actions in the process of abandoning a pipeline and  monitoring it post-abandonment is carried out through various compliance tools  and measures including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a requirement for an abandonment plan;</li>
<li>a requirement for consultation with landowners, aboriginal groups and other impacted stakeholders on the development of the abandonment plan;</li>
<li>written or oral hearings for abandonment applications;</li>
<li>company notification of the abandonment hearing to landowners, aboriginal groups and other impacted stakeholders;</li>
<li>examination of the company's plan to set aside funds for abandonment, future monitoring as well as unforeseen events;</li>
<li>setting out conditions that companies must meet in order to abandon a pipeline (often hearings result in conditions that the company must meet before a pipeline is declared &quot;abandoned&quot;);</li>
<li>investigation of incidents;</li>
<li>regular compliance monitoring of pipeline abandonment through means such as NEB inspections and audits; and</li>
<li>enforcement action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NEB compliance role  does not end when the pipeline abandonment project is completed and all  NEB-imposed conditions are satisfied. Any part of the pipeline left exposed or  in the ground will require perpetual care by the company or its successor, as  well as regulatory oversight by the NEB.</p>
<p>If you have additional  questions or concerns you can contact NEB staff toll free at 1-800-899-1265  about any issues of interest.</p>

<h2><a id="s2"></a>2 Pipeline Abandonment Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="s2_1">2.1 When Does Abandonment Start and End?</h3>
<p>The abandonment phase of a pipeline lifecycle begins when  the pipeline company decides that it will permanently cease to provide service  on a pipeline route, and applies for abandonment of the pipeline or connected  facilities.  Abandoned pipe may be  removed from the ground, or it may be cleaned, treated and left in the  ground. There may be sections of the pipeline that are proposed to be removed  and other sections to remain in place. Surface facilities may be dismantled or  reused for other purposes. Prior to this, the company may have temporarily stopped  using the pipeline or &ldquo;deactivated&rdquo; it. An application for abandonment means  that the company has decided to permanently stop using that pipeline and is  seeking leave to &ldquo;abandon the  operation of a pipeline&rdquo; (according to section 74 of the NEB Act).</p>
<p>Section 24 of the NEB Act  requires a public hearing for abandonment applications. The public hearing may  be a written process and may include an oral portion. If the NEB grants leave  to abandon, it may impose conditions that must be met before abandonment of the  operation of the pipeline is considered complete.  The NEB may also impose conditions that apply  to the pipeline as long as it remains in the ground. To verify that the company meets these conditions and other legal  requirements, NEB Inspection Officers and <em>Canada  Labour Code </em>Safety Officers may conduct compliance inspections,  review submissions required by the NEB and conduct audits related to the  abandonment activities.</p>
<p>Once all of the NEB-ordered conditions for the physical  aspects of an abandonment project are met, the risk to public safety, property  and the environment are to be at a level that is acceptable in the public  interest. At this point, the company or its successor is required to monitor  the pipeline and provide post-abandonment care (conduct monitoring and take  corrective action for any issues). The NEB will continue to oversee and  regulate the abandoned pipe or facility.</p>
<p>If a company or any other person plans to make contact with, alter or remove an abandoned pipeline then an application for leave from the Board is required. The Board may set conditions on how the work is to be conducted (e.g. timing or reclamation requirements).</p>
<p>There is a difference between pipeline abandonment and pipeline decommissioning. For further information see the NEB website at <a href="">www.neb-one.gc.ca</a> for <em>Amendments to the Guidance Notes for the Decommissioning Provisions  under the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations and National  Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations and NEB Filing Manual to clarify and  include requirements on decommissioning.</em></p>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p class="text-center "><strong><em>Abandonment Funding</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The NEB held a public hearing in May&nbsp;2009 on pipeline abandonment financial issues. Reasons for Decision&nbsp;RH-2-2008 provides additional information. It is on the NEB's website ( <a href="">www.neb-one.gc.ca</a>) in a section called &quot;Land Matters&quot; or you may obtain a copy by calling 1-800-899-1265.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Pipeline Abandonment - Financial Issues</h3>
<p>Pipeline and facility owners and operators are responsible for the costs  arising from an abandoned pipe or facility. The costs include the abandonment  work and unforeseen events such as pipeline settlement or exposure of the pipe  that might occur after abandonment.</p>
<p>The NEB requires companies to set aside money for abandonment work,  including the activities to deal with unforeseen events. In addition, the  company is required to review the funding collection program over time to  provide assurance that the amounts being set aside are appropriate. All  companies are required to file annual reports with the Board as set out in  Appendix XV or XVI of Board decision MH-001-2013. The company must also clearly  set out the process for accessing the funds.</p>
<h3><a id="s2_3"></a>2.3 Abandonment Application</h3>
<p>An application to abandon will typically include the information  identified in the NEB Filing Manual. It will include the reasons for the  abandonment and the actions that will be taken. In addition, it will show that  the proposed abandonment will be carried out in a safe manner and that  potential environmental, socio-economic, economic and financial impacts are  identified and addressed. The company must also provide evidence that  landowners, indigenous groups, occupants, land managers, lessees, municipal  agencies and upstream and downstream users and other persons potentially  affected were sufficiently notified and consulted prior to the application  being filed.</p>
<p>The company is expected to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>a complete description of the facilities being abandoned;</li>
<li>an assessment of potential safety hazards related to the abandonment and mitigation actions planned to reduce such hazards;</li>
<li>an Abandonment Plan outlining how the facility will be prepared for abandonment and how it will be monitored, if necessary, during its abandonment;</li>
<li>a description and justification for the methods that will be used to identify and clean up any contamination found at the project sites including;
<ul>
<li>the amount of contamination that may exist;</li>
<li>special handling techniques that will be used; and</li>
<li>regulatory requirements that will be followed for cleanup and disposal;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how and when the facilities will be abandoned;</li>
<li>how the environment will be reclaimed;</li>
<li>how the abandonment method is appropriate for the ecological setting where it is located; and</li>
<li>how the company plans to set aside funds for abandonment, future monitoring as well as unforeseen events.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s2_4">2.4 Company Audit</h3>
<p>As part of the abandonment process, a company must have audits and inspections done on a regular basis. Audits may be carried out by company employees or third parties, provided they are independent of the abandonment process. The purpose of audits is to verify that the abandonment complies with Section 53 of the OPR and any Certificates or Orders issued by the NEB  related to the protection of property and the environment and the safety of the  public and of the company&rsquo;s employees.</p>
<p>The audit results in a report that verifies compliance and documents all  non-compliances, how the company  has or will correct any non-compliance, and may provide recommendations. The  NEB will also conduct its own audits of company programs.</p>
<h3 id="s2_5">2.5 Record Retention</h3>
<p>Section 56(g) of the OPR requires a company to keep records of its  audits and make these available to NEB auditors upon request.  The records must comply with the requirements  in the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z662 standard. Also, the company  must retain the following for at least two years after abandonment:</p>
<ol class="lst-lwr-rmn ">
<li>all records available to the company in respect of the procedures used in each stage of construction;</li>
<li>the production reports and mill certificates;</li>
<li>the specifications and name-plate data, if any, of the pumps, compressors, drivers, storage tanks and other major equipment of the pipeline;</li>
<li>the performance curves of all main line pumps and compressors of the pipeline;</li>
<li>the reports of all  monitoring and surveillance programs developed under section 39 of the  OPR;</li>
<li>the documentation referred  to in section 41 of the OPR in  respect of pipeline defects; and</li>
<li>the documentation on all  incidents reported under section 52 of the OPR.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="s3">3 Abandonment Plan</h2>
<p>The NEB established principles for pipeline abandonment  in 2009.  One of the principles is that  the company will develop an abandonment plan (Plan) and will involve persons and groups directly affected by the  retirement of facilities. The Plan should reduce the risk to public  safety, property and the environment to a level that is acceptable in the  public interest.</p>
<p>A detailed Plan is expected to be filed with an application for  abandonment and, if an Abandonment Order is issued, modified if necessary and  implemented. An example of a Table of Contents for a Plan is attached as  Appendix I. It was developed with input from the public and industry.</p>
<p>Years before abandonment occurs, less-detailed preliminary plans are  recommended as a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; to determine the amount of money to set aside  for abandonment work. Over time, further details are developed and cost  estimates are improved.</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p><strong>An Abandonment Plan should reduce the risk to public safety, property and the  environment to an acceptable level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Companies are expected to consult with the public when developing an Abandonment Plan. This consultation would include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Details on what areas require containment or clean up;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Discussion about what facilities should be removed;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information about what reclamation will be provided;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conversations about whether or not the correct land use is being accommodated; and</strong></li>
<li><strong>How potential issues will be mitigated.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2><a id="s4"></a>4 Performance Measures</h2>
<p>A Plan will identify performance measures. These give the company a way  to evaluate the abandonment process and activities that occur during and after abandonment,  such as maintaining any equipment left in place, monitoring where required and  reclamation success. An objective of the abandonment project is to eliminate or  reduce the risk to the public and the environment to acceptable and appropriate  levels, considering the desired use of the land. To reduce risk, the company  will conduct environmental site assessments, mitigate environmental effects and  satisfy the conditions of the NEB Abandonment Order.</p>
<p>Typically, key abandonment objectives include, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning up contamination;</li>
<li>protecting water body, utility and transportation crossings;</li>
<li>accommodating desired land use;</li>
<li>protecting sensitive environmental areas; and</li>
<li>managing long term pipeline effects on the land.</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance measures permit NEB inspectors and companies and successors  to evaluate whether the company is achieving meaningful progress towards the  abandonment objectives and ongoing care of the abandoned pipeline in a number  of different ways including the following examples:</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Measures (Is  the Plan being followed during the abandonment project?)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How many of the Abandonment Order conditions are met?</li>
<li>How much of the pipeline Right of Way is restored?</li>
<li>How many of the contaminated areas are cleaned up?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engagement Measures (What do the interested parties say?)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Satisfaction survey conducted by company</li>
<li>Responses to landowner surveys</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Maintenance (after the NEB abandonment Order is satisfied)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency of monitoring of  condition of the Right of Way for issues</li>
<li>Number of issues resolved  in consultation with the landowner</li>
</ul>
<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2 id="s5">5 Compliance Assessment Approach</h2>
<p>The NEB dedicates resources to oversee company activities for each  abandonment project just as it does for a new construction project. The size of  the project and a risk assessment based on the history of the company will  guide the NEB in deciding how closely the NEB will monitor the abandonment.</p>
<p>During compliance verification, the NEB will liaise with applicable  provincial and territorial jurisdictions as well as with any organizations or  groups identified as having concerns during the abandonment hearing process.</p>
<p>Abandonment activity will be required to comply with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the terms and conditions of the Abandonment Order that may include:
<ul>
<li>filing other documents with  the NEB, such as an Environmental Protection Program, safety or operations manuals, or work specifications; and</li>
<li>requiring the company to  undertake its work in accordance with the specifications, standards, policies,  mitigation measures, procedures, and other information referred to in its  application or as otherwise agreed to during the hearing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the abandonment plan;</li>
<li>applicable regulations  (e.g. Section 53 of the OPR regarding  company audits); and</li>
<li>industry best practices.</li>
</ul>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p class="text-center "><strong><em>NEB Inspection Officers</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Officers are specialized in one or more programs including; environment,
safety, pipeline integrity, security or emergency management. They are required to maintain         an Officer designation through in-house training and a minimum annual inspection frequency.</strong></p>

<p>Documents provided by the company and the NEB&rsquo;s responses are posted in  the NEB website&rsquo;s Regulatory Document Repository and can be viewed by the  public.</p>
<p>The NEB monitors  whether the company  is complying with regulations and Orders in several  ways. The NEB may hold compliance meetings, do inspections, audit the project,  investigate any accidents or incidents, and respond to concerns raised by  landowners or others.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_1_1"></a>5.1.1 Compliance Meetings</h4>
<p>Meetings will be held with a company as necessary to assess the  implementation of pipeline abandonment activities. These meetings may address  Corrective Action Plans filed by the company in response to a previous audit or  inspection conducted by NEB. A meeting may also be a follow-up on specific  implementation issues with respect to issues found during other compliance  activities or recommendations made by NEB staff.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_1_2"></a>5.1.2 Inspection</h4>
<p>An inspection of an abandonment project allows the NEB to observe and evaluate circumstances in the field to:</p>
<ul>
<li>observe abandonment construction or operational practices.</li>
<li>assess compliance;</li>
<li>confirm effectiveness of safety and environmental protection measures; and</li>
<li>identify potential issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspections are a tool used to verify whether the company is complying  with Order conditions and regulatory requirements such as those related to  worker safety and environmental protection.   An inspection report is completed and issued to the company  representative at the end of the inspection. The report describes the scope of  the inspection, summarizes all discussions, observations, non-compliances and  non-compliances corrected in the field. It also  references Notices of Non-Compliance received (discussed in paragraph 5.2.2)  and verifies condition compliance. These reports are published on the NEB  website in the Compliance and Enforcement section.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_1_3"></a>5.1.3 NEB Audit</h4>
<p>Companies may be audited and evaluated against the requirements of the  NEB Act and its regulations, other relevant legislation and regulations, and  any conditions of an NEB Certificate or Order. An audit takes in a wide range  of company activities, including any abandonment project underway.  As part of this audit process and in  accordance with the OPR, companies will be audited and evaluated against the  processes, procedures and standards that each company identifies as being part  of its management and protection programs. These programs include emergency  management, safety and environmental protection.  The NEB has developed a standardized audit  protocol that is on its website, which will be used to evaluate these programs.  Targeted audits of abandoned facilities may also be conducted.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_1_4"></a>5.1.4 Investigations of Incidents</h4>
<p>The NEB investigates accidents and incidents involving NEB-regulated  facilities to determine causes and contributing factors. Incidents can occur  during and after the physical process of abandonment.The NEB expects that investigations conducted by the company will result  in corrective action. The NEB may also intervene and require that corrective  action be taken.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_1_5"></a>5.1.5 Landowner Issues</h4>
<p>Landowners and other interested parties may have concerns about impacts  and issues related to the  abandonment of pipeline facilities while it is being abandoned and  afterwards.  As noted previously, the  application for abandonment must include a Plan that has been created in  consultation with landowners and other interested parties, so that their input  is considered and they have a clear understanding of how abandonment will occur. This should facilitate discussions  on any issues.</p>
<p>The NEB will determine the facts associated with a concern, and address  the concern through one or more of the following: inspections, site visits,  meetings, or an inspector direction.</p>
<p>The concern will be addressed in an open and transparent procedure where the company is required to respond to the landowner’s and the NEB’s written and oral inquiries and concerns.</p>
<p>If the appropriate conditions exist for mutual resolution, then an Appropriate Dispute Resolution (ADR) process may be initiated and facilitated by Board staff. In some cases, where resolution of a concern is difficult, the NEB may be asked by the landowner or the company to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Where there is a disagreement between a company and landowner over compensation for damages caused by the company’s operations or abandoned pipeline, then negotiation services may be sought from the Minister of Natural Resources (Minister). If there is a subsequent disagreement on the award of compensation, then arbitration proceedings may be sought from the Minister. Information on these compensation and arbitration processes is available on the Natural Resources Canada website.
</p>
<h3 id="s5_2">5.2 Enforcement</h3>
<p>Enforcement action is taken by the NEB when the company is not complying with the NEB Abandonment Order or the applicable regulations. The actions taken escalate depending on the severity of the non-compliance and the degree of cooperation of the company.</p> 
<p> The enforcement tools available to an inspection officer include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice of Non-Compliance (5.2.1);</li>
<li>Inspection Officer Order (5.2.2);</li>
<li>Board Order (5.2.3); and</li>
<li><em>Canada Labour Code </em>Assurance of Voluntary  Compliance (5.2.4);</li>
<li><em>Canada Labour Code </em>Direction (5.2.5).</li>
<li>Administrative Monetary  Penalties (5.2.6)</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="s5_2_1"></a>5.2.1 Notice of Non-Compliance (NNC)</h4>
<p>An NNC is a written notice issued by the Inspection Officer to an NEB-regulated company or third party when non-compliance with a low probability of harm to people or the environment is observed and where time is required to address the issue. It is intended to bring compliance issues to the attention of the company/individual, in order to generate the necessary action to return to compliance. The Inspection Officer will determine an effective corrective action, consult with the regulated company, and propose a reasonable timeline to correct the non- compliance. It is not a finding of guilt or civil liability, but will form part of the NEB’s records when planning its compliance verification activities and determining what enforcement action to take for future or re-occurring non-compliances.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_2_2"></a>5.2.2 Inspection Officer Order</h4>
<p>An Inspection Officer Order (Order) is issued under section 51.1 of the NEB Act. This Order may suspend work and specify measures to be undertaken.  An Order will only be used if it is possible that a hazard is occurring or may occur that will affect the safety of the public or employees of a company or cause harm to property or the environment. The Order may be lifted by an NEB Inspection Officer or the Board once the problem has been rectified. If the company fails to comply with the Order or if non-compliance with an Order is observed then additional action will be taken.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_2_3"></a>5.2.3 Board Order</h4>
<p>If the company fails to meet requirements of an Abandonment Order or is in contravention with the regulations, then the matter may be referred to the NEB. The NEB will review the circumstances of the situation and decide how best to proceed, including issuing a Board Order.</p>
<p>If a company does not comply with a Board Order or an Inspection Officer Order the Board may take any action or measure considered necessary in relation to the abandonment of a pipeline by the company or in relation to the company’s abandoned pipeline, or it may authorize a third party to take any such action or measure.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_2_4"></a>5.2.4 Canada Labour Code (CLC) Assurance of Voluntary Compliance (AVC)</h4>
<p>A NEB staff member designated as a Health and Safety Officer under the  CLC may accept an AVC for health and safety issues, which are minor in nature.  AVCs are received for non- compliances at the Health and Safety Officer&rsquo;s  discretion. An AVC can be received from the company representative in the  field.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_2_5"></a>5.2.5 Canada Labour Code Direction</h4>
<p>Directions are given under section 145 of the CLC if the Health and Safety Officer is of the opinion that there is a contravention of Part II (Occupational Health and Safety) of the CLC. The Health and Safety Officer may direct the employer or employee concerned to stop conducting the prohibited activity within such time as the Health and Safety Officer may specify. The Health and Safety Officer shall, if requested by the employer or employee concerned, confirm the direction in writing if the direction was given orally.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_2_6"></a>5.2.6 Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)</h4>
<p>An AMP is a financial penalty imposed on individuals or companies contraventions of safety and environmental protection legislative requirements that have been designated as violations. AMPs will be used in situations where compliance has not been obtained using either facilitated or directed compliance tools, where harm is caused or is likely to be caused by the non-compliance or in any other situation where they are the best tool to obtain compliance or deter future non-compliance.</p>
<p>An AMP can be used alone, or in conjunction with, other enforcement tools depending on the circumstances.</p>
<h4><a id="s5_2_7"></a>5.2.7 <em>Canada Labour Code</em> Direction</h4>

<h2 id="s6">6 Conclusion</h2>
<p>The NEB is required to hold a public hearing process for every pipeline that is going to be abandoned. Information collected during the hearing process, as well as established abandonment requirements are used to inform the conditions the Board will impose on an abandonment activity and regulate facilities undergoing abandonment.</p>
<p>The NEB will require that companies set money aside, and have a suitable mechanism to access that money, for its remaining obligations to monitor and to address unforeseen events such as subsidence and exposure of pipe.</p>
<p>The NEB will monitor pipeline abandonment projects and abandoned pipelines as long as pipe is in the ground, through a variety of means and, if necessary, take enforcement action.</p>

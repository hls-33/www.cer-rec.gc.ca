        <h2 id="a1">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The Canadian oil and gas industry and federal and provincial regulatory authorities 
        recognize the need to develop guidelines that companies can follow in order to abandon 
        oil and gas pipelines in an environmentally sound, safe, and economical manner. To 
        meet this objective, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and the Canadian 
        Energy Pipeline Association (through their industry participants) have participated 
        along with the National Energy Board and <a href="#a2">various departments</a> of the Government of Alberta in the development of this discussion paper.</p>
        <p>This paper reviews the technical and environmental issues associated with pipeline 
        abandonment and is intended to provide a basis for further discussion on the issue. 
        In order to complete the assessment of this issue, a review of the legal and financial 
        aspects of pipeline abandonment need to be undertaken. More particularly, the core 
        issues of long-term liability and funding need to be addressed both in the context 
        of orphaned pipelines and those with an identifiable owner/operator.</p>
        <p>This paper is intended to assist a company in the development of an abandonment 
        plan through the recognition of the general issues which result from the abandonment 
        of a pipeline and by providing the means to address those issues. Land use management, 
        ground subsidence, soil and groundwater contamination, erosion, and the potential 
        to create water conduits are among the topics addressed.</p>
        <p>Some follow-up may be required in respect of the technical analysis presented on 
        the issue of ground subsidence. It is suggested that tolerance criteria be developed 
        and that the industry survey referred to in the paper be complemented with a field 
        investigation program. Scale modelling could also be performed to confirm the theoretical 
        ground subsidence calculations.</p>
        <p>As illustrated by the diagram on the following page, the pipeline abandonment planning 
        process is a multi-dimensional exercise that requires wide stakeholder input. The 
        abandonment project schedule should also provide an opportunity for meaningful input 
        into the planning process by the affected public, as defined by the scope of the project. 
        It is especially important that landowners and land managers have a central role in 
        this process.</p>
        <p>In practice, the decision to abandon in place or through removal should be made 
        on the basis of a comprehensive site-specific assessment. In this context, the analysis 
        presented in this paper has limitations in that all site specifics could not possibly 
        be addressed, particularly in relation to potential environmental impacts or impacts 
        on land use.</p>
        <p>The development and implementation of a pipeline abandonment plan that will both 
        minimize impacts to the environment and land use and be cost-effective requires many 
        activities similar in scope to the planning or installation of a new pipeline. For 
        any large-scale abandonment project, it is unlikely that any one abandonment technique 
        will be employed. Rather, a project will usually involve a combination of pipe removal 
        and abandonment-in-place along the length of the pipeline. A key factor influencing 
        the choice between the two options is present and future land use.</p>
        <p>In summary, the key features of a proper abandonment plan are</p>
        <div class="mrgn-lft-md">
          <p>(i) that it be tailored to the specifics of the project,</p>
          <p>(ii) that an early and open opportunity be provided for public and landowner input, and</p>
          <p>(iii) that it comply with current regulatory requirements. It is also necessary 
          that the plan be broad in scope and encompass post-abandonment responsibilities in 
          the form of right-of-way monitoring and remediation of problems associated with the abandonment.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A major issue still to be addressed is the question of who would assume responsibility 
        if the owner/operator becomes insolvent. In this regard, industry has established 
        a fund in Alberta to cover the cost of reclamation and abandonment of orphaned oil 
        and gas wells and certain associated pipeline facilities.</p>

        <h2 id="s1">Section&nbsp;1 - Introduction</h2>
        <h3 id="s1_1">1.1 Background</h3>
        <p>Approximately 540,000&nbsp;km of operating oil and gas pipelines currently exist 
        in Canada, about 50&nbsp;percent of which are located in Alberta. Ultimately, all 
        oil and gas pipelines will reach the end of their useful lives, and will be abandoned. 
        The issue of pipeline abandonment should therefore be reviewed by all stakeholders.</p>
        <p>The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) estimates that about 17,000&nbsp;km 
        of pipeline were abandoned or discontinued in Alberta as of April&nbsp;1994. This 
        number includes an estimated 3&nbsp;600&nbsp;km of orphaned abandoned pipelines. The 
        majority of abandoned pipelines in Alberta are gathering lines 168.3&nbsp;mm or less 
        in outside diameter.</p>
        <p>Regulatory requirements for pipeline abandonment vary across jurisdictions in Canada, 
        and in many cases do not completely address associated long-term issues.</p>
        <h3 id="s1_2">1.2 Review Initiatives</h3>
        <p>In&nbsp;1984, several parties at a National Energy Board (NEB) hearing into the 
        tolls of a major natural gas transmission pipeline company showed an interest in addressing 
        the issue of negative salvage as it related to pipeline abandonment. As a result, 
        the NEB issued a background paper in September&nbsp;1985 addressing the negative salvage 
        impacts of pipeline abandonment. The issue was not pursued again until&nbsp;1990, 
        when industry, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (now the EUB), and 
        Alberta Environmental Protection (AEP) discussed the issue of pipeline abandonment 
        while considering amendments to the pipeline regulations issued pursuant to the <em>Pipeline Act</em> (Revised Statutes of Alberta&nbsp;1980). The issue was not resolved at that time, and was again raised in&nbsp;1993 by the Alberta Pipeline Environmental 
        Steering Committee, an industry, government, and public stakeholder group established 
        to address pipeline related issues.</p>
        <p>In October&nbsp;1993, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) received 
        the endorsement of the Alberta Petroleum Industry Government Environment Committee 
        to establish a steering committee to oversee the issue of pipeline abandonment. Shortly 
        thereafter, the EUB requested that CAPP and the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association 
        (CEPA) organize a steering committee to resolve the concerns surrounding abandonment.</p>
        <p>In April&nbsp;1994, representatives from CAPP, CEPA, the EUB, and the NEB met to 
        establish a pipeline abandonment steering committee. It was also decided at that time 
        that separate subcommittees be struck to address the technical, environmental, legal, 
        and financial aspects of pipeline abandonment. The technical and environmental subcommittees 
        were the first to be formed and, together with the steering committee, were responsible 
        for this discussion paper. The legal and financial subcommittees have not yet been 
        struck.</p>
        <h3 id="s1_3">1.3 Scope</h3>
        <p>This discussion paper is intended to apply to all buried metallic pipeline facilities 
        falling within the scope of the CSA&nbsp;Z662-94 &quot;Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems&quot; standard, 
        except for offshore pipelines. Many of the same issues and concepts (such as those 
        relating to land use and pipe cleanliness) also apply to plastic and fibreglass pipelines. 
        It addresses pipeline abandonment only (i.e.&nbsp;permanent removal from service), 
        and does not consider pipeline deactivation (i.e.&nbsp;temporary removal from service). 
        Likewise, this document does not address the abandonment of aboveground facilities 
        associated with pipelines, such as stations or tank farms, or specific facilities 
        such as underground vaults.</p>
        <p>This paper addresses the technical and environmental aspects of pipeline abandonment. 
        In order to complete the assessment, a review of the legal and financial aspects of 
        pipeline abandonment needs to be undertaken. More particularly, the core issues of 
        long-term liability and funding need to be addressed both in the context of orphaned 
        pipelines and those with an identifiable owner/operator.</p>
        <h3 id="s1_4">1.4 Abandonment Options</h3>
        <p>The two basic options that are considered in this paper are (i) abandonment-in-place 
        and (ii) pipeline removal. In the former case, it is assumed for the purposes of this 
        paper that cathodic protection of the pipeline is discontinued and that no other measures 
        are taken to maintain the structural integrity of the abandoned pipeline (other than 
        the potential use of solid fill material at roadway and railway crossing sites or 
        other locations highly sensitive to ground subsidence).</p>
        <p>As noted in <a href="#s2">Section&nbsp;2</a>, for any 
        large-scale abandonment project it is unlikely that only one of these options will 
        be employed. Rather, a project will usually involve a combination of pipe removal 
        and abandonment-in-place along the length of the pipeline. A key factor influencing 
        the choice between the two options is present and future land use.</p>
        <p>It is further noted that the abandonment techniques presented are confined to those 
        possible using currently available technology. While developments in pipeline removal 
        and abandonment technologies were evaluated, no major improvements to the methods 
        currently in use were discovered. However, as pipeline abandonments become more prevalent, 
        improved abandonment methods will likely be developed.</p>
        <h3 id="s1_5">1.5 Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective of this discussion paper is to assist the user in the development 
        of a pipeline abandonment plan, a framework for which is provided in <a href="#s2">Section&nbsp;2</a> of this paper. More particularly, the paper is meant to assist parties in making an 
        informed decision between abandoning in place or through removal. <a href="#s3">Section&nbsp;3</a> outlines the general technical and environmental issues that should be considered 
        when abandoning a pipeline, while <a href="#s4">Section&nbsp;4</a> elaborates 
        on post-abandonment responsibilities. Site-specific issues should be addressed on 
        a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>The objective of creating an abandonment plan is to ensure that identified issues 
        have been addressed and that the pipeline is abandoned in a way that provides a forum 
        for meaningful stakeholder input and ensures that public safety and environmental 
        stability are maintained.</p>
        <h3 id="s1_6">1.6 Regulatory Requirements</h3>
        <p>The NEB is responsible for regulating interprovincial and international pipeline 
        systems in Canada, while the individual provinces are responsible for regulating intraprovincial 
        pipeline systems. Within each province, gathering, transmission, and distribution 
        pipelines may be regulated by different agencies. For example, in Alberta the EUB 
        regulates gathering and transmission lines as well as higher-pressure distribution 
        lines (greater than 700&nbsp;kPa), while lower-pressure distribution lines are regulated 
        by Alberta Transportation and Utilities. AEP, through the <em>Environmental 
        Protection and Enhancement Act</em> (EPEA), regulates conservation and reclamation 
        activities for all three categories of pipelines.</p>
        <p>In addition to the primary regulators, there may be other governmental agencies 
        within each of the respective jurisdictions that may have an interest in the abandonment 
        and reclamation of a pipeline. These other agencies may include local governments, 
        especially in populated areas where pipeline abandonment may impact upon land uses.</p>
        <p>In Alberta, the EUB sets the requirements for the abandonment of gathering and 
        transmission lines. In addition to meeting the EUB's abandonment requirements, the 
        pipeline right-of-way must be reclaimed to AEP standards. Reclamation certificates 
        are issued by inspectors designated under EPEA. For removal projects that are classified 
        as Class&nbsp;I projects,<sup>[1]</sup> the operator is required 
        to obtain an approval under EPEA from AEP to ensure that proper conservation and reclamation occurs. For smaller projects, AEP's <em>Environmental Protection 
        Guidelines for Pipelines</em> are to be followed during construction.</p>
        <p class="small ">[1] A Class&nbsp;I pipeline is defined by the Activities Designation Regulation (AR&nbsp;110/93) under EPEA as any pipeline that has an index of&nbsp;2690 
        or greater, determined by mutiplying the diameter of the pipeline in&nbsp;millimetres 
        by the length of the pipeline in&nbsp;kilometres (e.g.&nbsp;168.3&nbsp;mm&nbsp;x&nbsp;16&nbsp;km&nbsp;= 
        2693).</p>
        <p>For federally regulated pipelines, approval to abandon a pipeline must be granted 
        by the NEB and pipelines must be abandoned in accordance with the requirements of 
        the NEB's <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-99-294/index.html" rel="external"><em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em></a>. These regulations are in the process of being revised, and 
        future regulations will likely require that applications for pipeline abandonment 
        be treated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>A summary of the current regulatory requirements for pipeline abandonment across 
        Canada has been included as <a href="#nxa">Appendix&nbsp;A</a>.</p>
        <div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
        <h2 id="s2">Section&nbsp;2 - Developing an Abandonment Plan</h2>
        <p>This paper addresses the common issues that pipeline abandonment plans should address 
        regardless of regulatory jurisdiction. It is intended to assist a company in the development of an abandonment plan through the recognition of the general issues which result 
        from the abandonment of a pipeline and by providing the means to address those issues.</p>
        <p>In practice, the decision to abandon in place or through removal should be made 
        on the basis of a comprehensive site-specific assessment. In this context, the analysis 
        presented in this paper has limitations in that all site specifics could not possibly 
        be addressed, particularly in relation to potential environmental impacts or impacts 
        on present and future land use.</p>
        <p>The development and implementation of a pipeline abandonment plan that will minimize 
        impacts to the environment and land use and be cost-effective requires many activities 
        similar in scope to the planning or installation of a new pipeline. For any large-scale 
        abandonment project, it is unlikely that any one abandonment technique will be employed. 
        Once the principal technique has been chosen, therefore, the owner/operator should 
        assess on a site-specific basis whether an alternate approach should be followed for 
        selected segments of line.</p>
        <p>The abandonment project schedule should provide an opportunity for meaningful input 
        into the planning process by the affected public, as defined by the scope of the project. 
        It is especially important that landowners and land managers have a central role in 
        this process.</p>
        <p>The development of an abandonment plan should be initiated by reviewing the general 
        requirements of the regulatory jurisdiction(s) under which the pipeline is operated. 
        Beyond the requirements of the principal regulatory agencies, other legislation may 
        affect the particular abandonment project. For example, municipal requirements and 
        federal legislation such as the federal <em>Navigable Waters Protection 
        Act</em> or the <em>Fisheries Act</em> may affect the abandonment 
        options.</p>
        <p>It is also critical that easement agreements be reviewed, as their terms and conditions        may bear on the abandonment decision-making process.</p>
        <p>The development and implementation of an abandonment plan consists of at least 
        the following seven steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> review prevailing regulatory requirements applicable to the abandonment project;</li>
          <li> compile all relevant information on the pipeline system, including easement agreements;</li>
          <li> analyze by segment taking into account the factors addressed in <a href="#s3">Section&nbsp;3</a> of this paper, including present and future land use;</li>
          <li> develop the abandonment plan in consultation with stakeholders (such as landowners, 
          government authorities, and other directly affected parties), incorporating the information 
          compiled in the above steps;</li>
          <li> secure regulatory and landowner approvals as required for the pipeline abandonment 
          and site reclamation;</li>
          <li> implement the abandonment plan, the scope of which should include post-abandonment 
          responsibilities (addressed in <a href="#s4">Section&nbsp;4</a>); and</li>
          <li> secure final regulatory release. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A proponent undertaking an abandonment plan should follow these six steps, recognizing 
        that site-specific conditions may require additional steps in the development of the 
        plan.</p>

        and to <a href="#nxb">Appendix&nbsp;B</a> for a detailed abandonment checklist.</p>

        <h3 id="s3_1">3.1 Issue Identification</h3>
        <p>Abandonment issues arise from the need to address public safety, environmental 
        protection, and future land use. An initial scoping exercise was carried out to identify 
        the various technical and environmental issues associated with abandonment. Following 
        the development of a detailed issues list, field studies of existing abandoned facilities 
        were performed to verify the issues. In some cases, detailed studies were commissioned 
        in order to better understand the effects and interactions of certain issues.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[2] (Refer to the Bibliography in <a href="#nxe">Appendix&nbsp;E</a> for a list of the studies, copies of which are available for public viewing in the 
        libraries of CAPP, CEPA, the EUB, and the NEB.)</p>
        <p>The primary issues that were identified, and which are addressed in this section, 
        are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>land use management;</li>
          <li>ground subsidence;</li>
          <li>soil and groundwater contamination;</li>
          <li>pipe cleanliness;</li>
          <li>water crossings;</li>
          <li>erosion;</li>
          <li>utility and pipeline crossings;</li>
          <li>creation of water conduits;</li>
          <li>associated apparatus; and</li>
          <li>cost of abandonment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It was determined that most issues are not unique to the abandonment phase of the 
        pipeline life-cycle, but could involve an altered scope, varied timeline, or additional 
        stakeholders when compared to the issues of pipeline installation and operation. In 
        order to responsibly abandon a pipeline, the operator must consider all of the issues 
        and determine how they relate to the specific pipeline under consideration, in addition 
        to addressing stakeholder concerns and incorporating collected input.</p>
        <p>In any abandonment project, it is possible that a combination of both the abandonment-in-place 
        and removal options would be used, based on site-specific requirements. Thus, it is 
        important that all aspects of the abandonment issues be considered. As the following 
        discussion illustrates, the abandonmen-in-place option does not eliminate the need 
        for land disturbance or field activity, while pipeline removal need not encompass 
        the same level of disturbance or activity as that of pipeline construction.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_2">3.2 Land Use Management</h3>
        <p>Land use is the most important factor to consider in determining whether a pipeline 
        section should be abandoned in place or removed. Therefore, an understanding of the 
        current and potential land uses along the pipeline right-of-way is essential to making 
        informed decisions on available abandonment options.</p>
        <p>Of particular concern with respect to land use management are areas sensitive to 
        land disturbance, such as native prairie, parks and ecological reserves, unstable 
        or highly erodible slopes, areas susceptible to severe wind erosion, and irrigated 
        land, particularly flood irrigation systems. Additionally, land improvement activities 
        such as the installation of drainage tile or other drainage systems, landscaping, 
         and permanent structure installations could be affected by a proponent's decision 
        to abandon a line.</p>
        <p>Future land use should be considered because a pipeline abandoned in place could 
        become a physical obstruction to development, such as excavation for foundations, 
        pilings, or ongoing management practices such as deep ploughing or the installation 
        of sub-drains. It is critical that input be gathered from appropriate sources such 
        as landowners, land managers, lessees, and municipal agencies to support the decision 
        to abandon in place. In addition, sufficient documentation must be kept to allow for 
        detailed location information for future developers or owners.</p>
        <p>As noted in <a href="#s2">Section&nbsp;2</a>, the decision to abandon in place or 
        through removal should be made on the basis of a comprehensive site-specific assessment. In 
        this context, the land management characteristics that may be better suited to pipeline 
        abandonment-in-place include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>parks and natural areas;</li>
          <li>unstable or highly erodible surfaces;</li>
          <li>water crossings;</li>
          <li>flood irrigated fields;</li>
          <li>road and railway crossings;<sup>[3]</sup></li>
          <li>foreign pipeline crossings;</li>
          <li>extra depth burial of pipe (i.e.&nbsp;depth well in excess of one metre);</li>
          <li>native prairie and native parkland;</li>
          <li>forest cut blocks;</li>
          <li>designated waterfowl and wildlife habitat; and</li>
          <li>areas exhibiting poor and/or limited access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small ">[3] (as detailed in <a href="#s3_8">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>, 
        consideration should be given to filling pipeline sections abandoned in place underneath 
        roadways and railways with a solid material such as concrete in light of potential 
        ground subsidence impacts.)</p>
        <p>The key environmental protection measures to be considered when a pipeline is to 
        be abandoned in place are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>minimal disruption to ongoing or future land management activities;</li>
          <li>a complete and documented pipeline cleaning procedure;</li>
          <li>the clean-up of any spills or contaminated sites to prevailing regulatory requirements;</li>
          <li>a revegetation strategy to achieve pre-abandonment conditions, keeping erosion 
          control and soil stability as a priority;</li>
          <li>topsoil conservation for all areas disturbed during the abandonment process;</li>
          <li>reclamation of all site access roads, including those which had been developed 
          for the operational phase of the pipeline and any opened or developed for abandonment 
          activity;</li>
          <li>documented as-built information for future reference;</li>
          <li>application of sight blocks where appropriate (e.g.&nbsp;recreational areas and 
          wildlife habitat); and</li>
          <li>a monitoring program acceptable to all affected parties to ensure a process to 
          complete remediation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Proper environmental protection measures should be implemented, including appropriate 
        soil handling procedures, timber management, contingency plans (e.g.&nbsp;for spills 
        and wind or water erosion), protection of cultural features, weed control, and site 
        reclamation. For example, in Alberta, a Conservation and Reclamation (C&amp;R) report 
        may be required by AEP for pipelines which were constructed before the C&amp;R regulations 
        came into effect.</p>
        <p>Prior to the commencement of field activity, reclamation criteria should be agreed 
        upon by the owner/operator, regulatory authority, and landowner. The reclamation program 
        will normally be designed to ensure that the condition of the right-of-way land surface 
        is made at least equivalent to that existing just prior to the commencement of abandonment 
        activities, and as close as circumstances permit to the condition of the land that 
        existed prior to pipeline installation, and may entail:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>removing, storing, and replacing topsoil;</li>
          <li>soil contamination analysis and-clean up, if required;</li>
          <li>contouring disturbed land to control drainage;</li>
          <li>seeding affected areas to prevent erosion and establish vegetation;</li>
          <li>removal of all structures to a minimum depth of one metre below final contour 
          elevation;<sup>[4]</sup></li>
          <li>roaching and/or compacting excavated areas to compensate for future settlement; 
          and</li>
          <li>site-specific environmental requirements (e.g.&nbsp;reforestation).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small ">[4] (In areas where circumstances such as special farming practices 
        or nearby urban development exist, consideration should be given to removing structures 
        more than one metre below the final contour elevation.)</p>
        <p>As noted in <a href="#s4">Section&nbsp;4</a>, a right-of-way monitoring 
        plan should be developed to ensure that reclamation efforts are successful and that 
        no problems arise.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_3">3.3 Ground Subsidence</h3>
        <h4>3.3.1 General</h4>
        <p>The long term structural deterioration of a pipeline abandoned in place may lead 
        to some measure of ground subsidence. This is a primary issue to consider for larger-diameter 
        pipelines because of potential environmental and safety concerns. More particularly, 
        ground subsidence could create the potential for water channelling and subsequent 
        erosion, lead to topsoil loss, impact on land use and land aesthetics, and/or pose 
        a safety hazard.</p>
        <p>The acceptable subsidence limits and the potential factors affecting those limits 
        are significant areas requiring attention in the development of any abandonment plan. 
        Erosion may cause direct siltation to a watercourse, or cause slope failures and subsequent 
        siltation. Where potential siltation is an issue, proponents must be prepared to deal 
        with fisheries protection measures to remain in compliance with provincial and federal 
        legislation.</p>
        <p>The rate and amount of ground subsidence over time is difficult to predict as it 
        depends on a complex combination of site-specific factors, such as the corrosion mechanics 
        in the vicinity of the pipeline, the thickness and diameter of the pipeline, the quality 
        of the pipeline's coating, burial depth, soil type, the failure mechanics of the pipeline 
        material, and soil failure mechanics.</p>
        <p>Given the absence of previously documented research, studies were commissioned 
        on corrosion and soil mechanics in an attempt to establish the connection between 
        pipeline corrosion, the structural deterioration of pipe, and the resultant ground 
        subsidence that might be observed. Summaries of these studies and the conclusions 
        that were reached follow.</p>
        <h4>3.3.2 Pipeline Corrosion</h4>
        <p>The corrosion consultant's report addressed the mechanism of corrosion leading 
        to ultimate structural failure of a pipeline. The report stated that the rate of corrosion 
        of an abandoned pipeline can vary significantly due to the many factors which must 
        be present for corrosion to take place. Corrosion of buried pipelines occurs through 
        an electrochemical reaction that involves the loss of metal in one location (called 
        the anode) through the transfer of the metal ions to another location on the pipeline 
        (called the cathode). The rate of metal transfer depends on a number of factors such 
        as the quality of the pipeline coating, soil aeration (which supplies oxygen to the 
        pipe to allow the corrosion process to occur), types and homogeneity of soils, soil 
        moisture, and electrical factors which create the potential differences for a corrosion 
        cell to be established.</p>
        <p>The corrosion of a coated pipeline is normally restricted to those isolated areas 
        where there are defects in the coating or where the coating has become disbonded from 
        the pipe. Corrosion can be expected to be almost negligible in areas where the coating 
        integrity is intact. Based on his experience, the consultant observed that coating 
        holidays or disbondment occur on less than one&nbsp;percent of the length of most 
        pipelines. Pipeline corrosion in most cases occurs as localized pits, or spiral corrosion 
        areas, which eventually result in random perforations throughout the length of the 
        pipeline. It is extremely rare for corrosion to cover large areas of pipeline, rendering 
        a long segment of the pipeline susceptible to sudden and complete structural failure.</p>
        <p>To illustrate typical corrosion rates, the consultant used an example of a 323.9&nbsp;mm&nbsp;O.D. 
        pipeline in soils commonly found throughout Alberta and estimated that penetrating 
        pits would occur in the range of&nbsp;13 to 123&nbsp;years. Based upon the slow rate 
        of pitting corrosion that would occur in most cases, complete structural failure is 
        not likely to occur for decades or even centuries. Furthermore, given the non-uniform 
        nature of the corrosion process, it can be concluded that it is highly unlikely that 
        significant lengths of the pipeline would collapse at any one time.</p>
        <h4>3.3.3 Soil Mechanics</h4>
        <p>The soil mechanics report indicated that there has been no documented incidence 
        of ground subsidence due to pipeline structural failure. In order to predict soil 
        reaction to pipeline structural failure, the consultant modelled its review on shallow 
        mining and tunnelling research and documented case histories. The focus of the study 
        was to estimate possible surface subsidence that could be attributed to the complete 
        failure of tunnels of equal diameter and depth as the pipelines being modelled. This 
        represented a worst-case scenario, since as noted earlier a complete pipeline collapse 
        of any significant length is considered highly improbable.</p>
        <p>The report employed two different theoretical soil modelling techniques, the Rectangular 
        Soil Block and the Active Soil Wedge, to reflect the most common types of soils that 
        may be encountered. The ranges of subsidence calculated for varying sizes of pipelines 
        provided an approximation of the impacts that a significant pipeline collapse would 
        have on soils. The analysis indicated that ground subsidence associated with the collapse 
        of pipelines up to 323.9&nbsp;mm in diameter at typical burial depths would be negligible. 
        The analysis further indicated that while there would be some degree of subsidence 
        associated with larger pipeline sizes, it may be of sufficiently small scale so as 
        to be in a tolerable range.</p>
        <h4 id="s3_3_4">3.3.4 Field Investigation Program</h4>
        <p>In order to validate the conclusions of the technical reports, the subcommittees 
        undertook to document the ground subsidence of known abandoned pipelines.</p>
        <p>As a first step, the subcommittees searched the EUB's records and identified pipelines 
        168.3&nbsp;mm or larger in diameter that had been abandoned in place. Questionnaires 
        were forwarded to the owners/operators of some of those lines, requesting information 
        on pipeline diameter, coating type, year abandoned, whether cathodic protection had 
        been removed, and ground subsidence observations (reference <a href="#nxc">Appendix&nbsp;C</a> for copy of questionnaire). The responses to the survey, as well as industry discussions, 
        did not reveal any instances of observed subsidence.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[5] (As indicated in <a href="#nxc">Appendix&nbsp;C</a>, 
        all of the survey results gathered by the subcommittees are available for public viewing 
        in the libraries of CAPP, CEPA, the EUB, and the NEB.)</p>
        <h4>3.3.5 Summary of Findings</h4>
        <p>The analyses indicated that the structural failure of an abandoned pipeline due 
        to corrosion may take many decades, and that significant lengths of the pipeline would 
        not collapse at any one time due to the localized nature of the pitting process. Furthermore, 
        the analyses indicated that, even if the worst-case scenario of uniform and total 
        structural collapse was realized, ground subsidence would be negligible for pipelines 
        up to 323.9&nbsp;mm in diameter.</p>
        <p>The degree of subsidence associated with larger-diameter pipelines is highly dependent 
        on pipeline diameter, depth of cover, and local soil conditions, but can be expected 
        in many cases to be in a tolerable range. It should be noted that tolerance to soil 
        subsidence is in itself a site-specific issue, as it depends on land use and the local 
        environmental setting. Any pipeline owner/operator considering the abandonment-in-place 
        of a larger-diameter pipeline should therefore conduct a site-specific analysis in 
        order to evaluate both the degree and tolerability of any long-term subsidence that 
        might be expected. Such analyses should take into account the potential for heavy 
        vehicular loadings (e.g.&nbsp;farm equipment or logging trucks).</p>
        <p>On the basis of the foregoing, it is suggested that ground subsidence associated 
        with the structural failure of pipelines abandoned in place will not usually be a 
        critical issue. This conclusion was corroborated by the industry survey referred to 
        in <a href="#s3_3_4">Section&nbsp;3.3.4</a>. In areas where no settlement is allowed, 
        either by regulation or agreement (such as at highway crossing sites, as further explained 
        in <a href="#s3_8">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>), the option would exist to fill 
        the pipeline with an approved solid material such as concrete or sand.</p>
        <p>In terms of follow-up on this issue, it is suggested that tolerance criteria be 
        developed and that the industry survey referred to in this paper be complemented with 
        a field observation program. Scale modelling could also be performed to confirm the 
        theoretical ground subsidence calculations.</p>
        <h4>3.3.6 Subsidence as a Result of Pipeline Removal</h4>
        <p>The physical act of removing a pipeline is essentially the reverse operation of 
        pipeline construction and involves topsoil removal, backhoe excavation of the subsoil 
        to a depth at least even with the top of the pipe, pipe removal, backfilling and compaction 
        of the trench, replacement of the topsoil, and revegetation measures.</p>
        <p>During pipeline construction, a roach consisting of subsoil overlaid with topsoil 
        is usually employed to compensate for the settlement that will occur as the ditch 
        line settles. The same strategy can be employed at the abandonment stage to avoid 
        the need for reclamation in future years due to settlement and erosion. In general, 
        if extra topsoil or soil materials are required for this operation, it could be recovered 
        from areas immediately adjacent to the pipeline right-of-way. For older pipelines 
        built before mandatory soil conservation, this is where extra topsoil or soil materials 
        may have been disposed. Further surveys or examinations of topsoil depths and soil 
        volumes may be required to identify these potential borrow areas.</p>
        <p>Without the concern of compaction damaging the pipeline, a company may undertake 
        a more rigorous compaction of the soil being replaced in the ditch following pipe 
        removal than after backfilling for new construction. Additional compaction may also 
        result in less topsoil handling and, therefore, fewer impacts due to the decreased 
        need to strip topsoil to accommodate the feathering out of subsoil material caused 
        by the excavation.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_4">3.4 Soil and Groundwater Contamination</h3>
        <p>The abandonment plan should address the potential for contamination associated 
        with the abandonment activities, as well as the need to eliminate any contamination 
        that may already exist, and include the appropriate pipe cleaning or pigging procedure. 
        Any contamination noted prior to abandonment activity should be cleaned up to the 
        applicable regulatory standards prior to full project disturbance, unless it is more 
        economically efficient to include the cleanup in the scope of abandonment activity 
        and it can be demonstrated that environmental damage will not be amplified.</p>
        <p>In order to gain additional insight into the issue of contamination, a study was 
        commissioned into the types and quantities of contaminants that might be released 
        from pipelines abandoned in place.</p>
        <p>The potential sources of contamination were identified as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the substances produced from the reservoir in the hydrocarbon stream and deposited 
          on the walls of the pipeline;</li>
          <li>treatment chemicals which could enter the pipeline and be deposited;</li>
          <li>the line pipe and associated facilities;</li>
          <li>pipeline coatings and their degradation products;</li>
          <li>historical leaks and spills of product that were not cleaned to current standards; 
          and</li>
          <li>possible PCB contamination, if PCBs were used in the pump or compressor lubricants 
          at some point in the history of the pipeline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The quantity of residual contaminants can be expected to decrease as the product 
        moves from the wellhead through the gathering, processing, and distribution systems. 
        Traditionally, oil pipelines contain a greater volume of wax and scale than do natural 
        gas pipelines, but this is dependent on the circumstances of the particular production 
        field. The study concluded that the effectiveness of pipeline pigging and cleaning 
        procedures prior to abandonment was the most critical determinant of the potential 
        quantities of residual contaminants.</p>
        <p>The subject of pipeline cleaning is addressed at length in <a href="#s3_5">Section&nbsp;3.5</a> and <a href="#nxd">Appendix&nbsp;D</a>. An operator should become familiar with 
        prevailing regulatory standards for soil and groundwater, as these standards may dictate 
        the minimum acceptable level of pipe cleanliness. Sound environmental protection practices 
        should be observed throughout the pipeline cleaning process, such as the use of properly 
        engineered containment and storage for all collected material, proper labelling, disposal 
        processes conforming to local regulations, and effective spill contingency plans. 
        Detailed documentation should be recorded on the results of the cleaning process or 
        the clean-up of a contaminated site.</p>
        <p>Operators should also have an understanding of the composition of pipe coatings 
        and their associated characteristics to assess any potential risk that may be derived 
        from abandoning the pipeline in place. For example, pipeline coatings containing asbestos 
        should be handled through special means by trained personnel. It has been suggested 
        that if pipe coating compounds would be accepted at local landfills, then abandoning 
        a pipeline with the same compounds in place may not be a concern, depending on site 
        conditions and concentration levels. Presently, limited information exists regarding 
        the long-term decomposition of pipeline coatings. However, it can be assumed that 
        as the coating adhesive degrades, or is consumed by soil organisms, coatings will 
        eventually disbond and contribute to the corrosion process.</p>
        <p>Many of the same contamination prevention measures to be employed for abandonment-in-place 
        also come into play in the context of pipeline removal. Of prime importance is the 
        need to clean the pipeline to accepted standards prior to the commencement of the 
        removal operation, and the employment of measures to prevent spills of the substances 
        collected as a result of the cleaning process. Collection trays should be used during 
        the pipe cutting operation to catch any residual fluids.</p>
        <p>During pipe removal, proper soil handling measures must be implemented to ensure 
        topsoil conservation.</p>
        <p>In addition to the pipeline itself, the dismantlement of any connected facilities 
        should be carried out such that the potential for contamination is controlled by proper 
        containment and storage for disposal at an approved facility.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_5">3.5 Pipe Cleanliness</h3>
        <h4>3.5.1 Cleanliness Criteria</h4>
        <p>In light of potential contamination concerns, the cleanliness of the pipeline is 
        an issue for both abandonment techniques. Although responsible cleaning procedures 
        have been defined and are discussed in detail in <a href="#s3_5_2">Section&nbsp;3.5.2</a> and <a href="#nxd">Appendix&nbsp;D</a>, the question of &quot;how clean is clean&quot; has not been resolved. In addition, the question remains as to whether pipe that will 
        be removed should be subject to the same cleanliness criteria as pipe that will be 
        left in place. It should be assumed that pipe that is to be removed should be cleaned 
        to a level where any remaining residues will not cause harm in any future intended 
        use of the pipe. Removed pipe that may eventually be put to some alternative use (e.g.&nbsp;pilings) 
        may require more study to determine the appropriate cleanliness requirements for the 
        future use. For pipe that is targeted for disposal, existing disposal or landfilling 
        guidelines will determine the required cleanliness of the pipe.</p>
        <p>For pipe that will be abandoned in place, the issue of pipe cleanliness is related 
        to corrosion and the creation of water conduits. Eventually the pipe will corrode 
        until perforated and, aided by the destructive forces of the freeze-thawing of infiltrated 
        water, the structural integrity of the pipe will suffer. Whether the rate of deterioration 
        will be greater than the life of the contaminants left as internal residue of the 
        pipe is unclear. Similarly, an issue remains over the rate and structural location 
        of any corrosion, in that it may allow water to infiltrate the abandoned pipe and 
        transport pipe residues to some other exit point.</p>
        <h4 id="s3_5_2">3.5.2 Cleaning Procedures</h4>
        <p>The pigging procedure used during the final operating stages and during evacuation 
        of the pipeline is critical in preparing the line for abandonment. The study on contaminants 
        concluded that the small quantities of hydrocarbons left in the line after a concerted 
        pig cleaning effort will not result in any significant environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>The factors impacting the effectiveness of any pig cleaning procedure will vary 
        with each pipeline. Cleaning programs must therefore be customized to the specific 
        circumstances of the pipeline under consideration for abandonment. For guidance purposes, <a href="#nxd">Appendix&nbsp;D</a> sets out general cleaning considerations and 
        describes typical cleaning methods for an oil pipeline in a medium duty service <sup>[6]</sup> or for a pipeline carrying relatively dry natural gas. Operators planning a pigging 
        program for a specific line should consider these guidelines as a starting point only. 
        The abandonment of pipelines carrying products other than the two noted above require 
        customized pigging procedures to ensure proper cleaning. Care should be taken in all 
        cases to properly contain and dispose of pigged effluent.</p>
        <p class="small ">[6] Medium duty service refers to relatively wax and direct 
        free operation with a scraping program undertaken occassionally to move along anything 
        collected or adhering to the pipe wall.</p>
        <p>A pipeline to be abandoned in place should be left such that no solids or waxy 
        build-up are visible at any point along the pipeline as observed through standard 
        pipe openings such as opened flange or sample connections and the contents have been 
        cleaned out to the extent that no more than a thin oily film on the inside pipe wall 
        surface can be detected by feel or sight. Sour liquid or natural gas pipelines should 
        be checked to confirm that H2S levels are below acceptable limits.</p>
        <p>Pipe cleaning is also of critical importance in the context of pipeline removal, 
        given the desire to minimize the risk of soil and groundwater contamination during 
        the removal process and the hazards associated with pipe removal (e.g.&nbsp;health 
        and flammability hazards of exposed vapours). Cleanliness considerations relating 
        to the future intended use or disposal of the pipe should also be taken into account, 
        bearing in mind that supplementary cleaning techniques may be employed once the pipe 
        has been removed from the ground.</p>
        <p>Cleaning effectiveness can be determined by taking pipe coupons and swabs of any 
        film found on the inside of the pipe and analyzing them for contamination, using cutout 
        means such as hot tapping or line cutouts.</p>
        <p>After allowing some time for the collection of remaining liquids in low areas (minimum 
        one week suggested), the pipeline should be excavated at random low areas. A minimum 
        of one excavation site per scraper trap or 80&nbsp;km interval is suggested. However, 
        in undulating areas multiple excavation sites may be required. Excavation sites should 
        be chosen to avoid environmentally sensitive areas and to minimize clearing associated 
        with the opening of access roads. If the examination of the inside wall shows that 
        the cleanliness criteria has been met, the cleaning task can be considered complete.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_6">3.6 Water Crossings</h3>
        <p>The effect of pipelines on water crossings is an important issue at any stage of 
        a pipeline project. This issue is a significant social consideration due to the visibility 
        of crossing activities, the importance of fisheries resources, public use of waterways, 
        the sensitivity of the resource, and the fact that waterways are an important cultural 
        and historical feature of the land.</p>
        <p>There are many factors to consider in deciding whether a section of pipeline crossing 
        a water body or wetland (e.g.&nbsp;muskeg, swamp, or flood plains) should be abandoned 
        in place or removed. More specifically, the risks associated with abandoning the pipeline 
        in place, including the potential for contamination and pipe exposure, have to be 
        weighed against the cost and environmental impact of removal.</p>
        <p>These trade-offs should be assessed on a site-specific basis, taking into account 
        the size and dynamics of the water body, the design of the pipeline crossing, soil 
        characteristics, slope stability, and environmental sensitivities. While these issues 
        must be evaluated, in most cases it can be expected that abandonment-in-place will 
        be the preferred option.</p>
        <p>If the pipeline crossing is to be abandoned in place, the pipe should be left in 
        as clean a state as possible to minimize the potential for contamination of the waterbody 
        should the eventual perforation and failure of the pipe allow any internal residues 
        to escape. As described in <a href="#s3_9">Section&nbsp;3.9</a>, 
        the strategic placement of caps and plugs will also help mitigate this concern by 
        interrupting the movement of potential contaminants through the abandoned pipe.</p>
        <p>The risk of pipe exposure is two-fold. First, the pipeline could become exposed 
        if the overlying soil is gradually eroded or washed away because of the dynamics of 
        the water body (e.g.&nbsp;stream bank migration, scour, or flood conditions). Secondly, 
        an empty pipeline crossing a water body or wet area could float toward the surface 
        if buoyancy control mechanisms fail (e.g.&nbsp;if concrete saddle weights slide off). 
        In either case, the owner/operator should assess the probability that the pipeline 
        could become exposed and the impacts that exposure would entail. If the risk of flotation 
        is a concern, it could be addressed by either perforating the line following an appropriately 
        sensitive line cleaning program to allow it to fill with water or by filling the line 
        with concrete or some other solid material. In the case of the former option, plugs 
        and caps should be used to prevent water migration through the pipeline.</p>
        <p>If applicable, the risks associated with abandoning a pipeline in place which runs 
        parallel to an operating pipeline at a water crossing should also be assessed.</p>
        <p>If the pipeline is to be removed in whole or in part, the issues would be similar 
        in many ways to those associated with initial construction across the water body or 
        wetland. More specifically, many of the same construction techniques and environmental 
        protection measures would apply. Aspects to address include fisheries resource timing 
        sensitivities, habitat protection, sediment control, vehicle and equipment crossing 
        methods, backfill material specifications and source, erosion control measures (both 
        short term and long term), and bank restoration. Damage to any existing bank stabilization 
        structures or destabilization of previously stable banks should be considered.</p>
        <p>It is crucial that the pipe be as clean as possible prior to excavation to minimize 
        the potential for contamination of the waterbody should the pipe be damaged and a 
        spill occur during the removal procedure. Blinding off the ends of the section being 
        removed is recommended to prevent contamination by any remaining traces of material.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_7">3.7 Erosion</h3>
        <p>Soil erosion is a concern during all phases of the pipeline life-cycle, particularly 
        as it relates to slope stability. Leaving a pipeline in the ground may entail a certain 
        amount of activity along the right-of-way to ensure responsible abandonment, such 
        as excavations to confirm cleaning quality and the installation of caps or plugs. 
        The potential impact of the ensuing right-of-way disturbance will vary greatly with 
        the geographic location of the activity. For example, a forest area &quot;duff&quot; layer may 
        not be as susceptible to erosion and slope instability as a region of native prairie 
        topsoil.</p>
        <p>If the pipe is to be removed, erosion and slope stability concerns will be similar 
        to those for pipeline construction. For example, traffic, soil compaction, and the 
        wind and water erosion of disturbed soil may be of concern. In addition, the pipeline 
        may have become a structural support to many slopes over time, and its removal may 
        affect the integrity of the slope.</p>
        <p>When developing an abandonment plan, the pipeline owner/operator should review 
        any erosion remediation that had occurred over the operating life of the pipeline. 
        If erosion control measures have been regularly required at specific locations, the 
        owner/operator should determine if it would be appropriate to implement longer term 
        erosion control measures.</p>
        <p>If the abandonment activities necessitate disturbing erosion-prone areas including 
        slopes, protection measures designed to current standards should be implemented. In 
        addition, the integrity and effectiveness of any existing ditch plugs, sub-drains, 
        berms, or other installations should be reviewed.</p>
        <p>It is usually more appropriate to abandon pipe at unstable slopes in place, due 
        to the potential requirement for extensive remediation if the pipeline is removed. 
        On sensitive slopes, the use of sight blocks or other measures should be considered 
        to discourage use of the right-of-way. In areas where the right-of-way has been traditional 
        access for recreational users or hunters, the operator should attempt to reach an 
        agreement with the land manager for ongoing remediation, if necessary.</p>
        <p>In areas where slope movement was being monitored during the pipeline's operating 
        life, the monitoring program should be re-evaluated and continued, if warranted. Temporary 
        access roads to slopes should be reclaimed as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Protective measures to be considered when removing a pipeline from a slope would 
        be similar to those used during pipeline construction. The integrity of the slope 
        must be maintained during the removal activities, as well as after the line is removed. 
        If the removal calls for spot excavations (bellholes) instead of an open ditch removal, 
        the stability of the entire slope, as well as the region surrounding the bellholes, 
        should be evaluated. Re-installation of diversion berms and ditch plugs to prevent 
        water channelling may be required.</p>
        <p>Development of the abandonment plan should include consultations with other pipeline 
        owners/operators that may be affected by right-of-way disturbances on the slope. In 
        addition, regulators and landowners should be consulted in order to determine an appropriate 
        period for right-of-way monitoring after the pipeline is removed. A typical monitoring 
        period would be two&nbsp;years. Revegetation programs should consider the inclusion 
        of a species that is quick to establish in the revegetation mixture, as this may help 
        to provide short term erosion control; however, the environmental effect of introducing 
        a non-native species must be considered. Regulatory/landowner approval of the seeding 
        mixture would likely be required. A weed control plan should be initiated during the 
        pipe removal process to address potential concerns immediately following surface disturbance.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_8">3.8 Road, Railway, and Utility Crossings</h3>
        <p>All crossings associated with a pipeline that is being abandoned must be addressed 
        in an appropriate manner. Of particular importance are the agreements relating to 
        the crossings of railways, primary and secondary highways, roads, other pipelines, 
        power lines, and communication lines, and the constraints they may place on the abandonment 
        process.</p>
        <p>The parameters to be considered in selecting an abandonment technique for a crossing 
        site include the line diameter, installation details (including burial depth), subsidence 
        tolerance, impact of excavation, impacts on other cathodic protection systems (e.g.&nbsp;for 
        crossings of other pipelines), and long term development plans. Special consideration 
        should be given to the sensitivity of roadway and railway crossings to slight ground 
        depressions that could result from any abandonment related subsidence. The potential 
        may also exist for disruption to crossing traffic, both during and as a result of 
        the pipeline abandonment. As a result, more stringent abandonment requirements may 
        be imposed, such as filling the pipeline at the crossing site with concrete or other 
        approved material. Similarly, cased crossings may require a solid fill even if the 
        carrier pipe is removed.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
        <p class="small ">[7] If the carrier pipe remains in situ, both it and the casing 
        annulus may require a solid fill (need should be assessed on a site-specific basis.)</p>
        <p>The proper notification and location of the pipeline or utility being crossed is 
        essential to maintaining a safe working environment. Operators of utilities and other 
        pipelines may have established plans or expectations that may affect the design and 
        timing of the abandonment. Utility crossing or pipeline crossing locations may be 
        of concern when a pipeline is removed, due to the loss of support for the remaining 
        facility, or the interference of the abandonment operation or the abandoned pipeline 
        with the operation of the crossed utility or pipeline. Thus, discussions with utility 
        and other pipeline companies will add value to the resulting abandonment plan and 
        initiate protection planning.</p>
        <p>The main steps of the abandonment evaluation and implementation process for any 
        particular crossing site are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>review the existing crossing agreement and determine if there are any terms and 
          conditions relating to abandonment-in-place or pipeline removal;</li>
          <li>establish communications with the utility or pipeline being crossed and negotiate 
          terms and conditions (both technical and legal) to abandon the pipeline in place or 
          remove the pipe;</li>
          <li>amend the existing crossing agreement to address the terms and conditions of the 
          abandonment plan;</li>
          <li>notify all affected parties about abandonment activities and responsibilities;</li>
          <li>ensure that necessary approvals (e.g.&nbsp;from regulatory authorities, the utility 
          being crossed, and the landowner) are obtained and kept on record;</li>
          <li>obtain proper location and identification of pipelines and utilities in the area 
          using agencies such as Alberta First Call prior to commencing removal activities, 
          and alert landowners to the activities taking place;</li>
          <li>file the necessary permanent records of the pipeline abandonment plan with interested 
          parties (including pipeline regulatory authorities, provincial one-call systems, environmental 
          groups, land titles, pipeline registers, and the affected crossing parties); and</li>
          <li>in the case of abandonment-in-place, ensure that the inspection requirements for 
          the crossing are part of the post-abandonment monitoring plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="s3_9">3.9 Creation of Water Conduits</h3>
        <p>The potential to create water conduits as a result of the abandonment process is 
        of concern as it could lead to unnatural drainage and material transport. This issue 
        is primarily of concern when a pipeline is abandoned in place, since water will eventually 
        infiltrate the pipe through perforations in the pipe wall caused by corrosion.</p>
        <p>Unless water pathways through the pipeline are interrupted, this could lead to 
        the unnatural drainage of areas such as muskegs, sloughs, or marshes, thus affecting 
        the natural balance of the ecosystem. Likewise, a previously stable low area could 
        be flooded by volumes of water exiting from a perforated pipeline. This issue can 
        be related to the concern for contamination and the protection of wetland systems. 
        If water infiltrates the pipeline, the potential exists for that water to carry any 
        residual contaminants left in the abandoned pipeline to some point of exit. The point 
        of exit could be a watercourse, thereby contaminating the watercourse if contaminant 
        levels are sufficiently great in volume and concentration at the point of exit. The 
        possibility of soil contamination may also exist, depending on the nature of the contaminant 
        transported through the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Plugs should be installed at appropriate spacings to ensure that changes in surface 
        and ground water conditions will not result in water flow through the pipeline. When 
        identifying locations for the plugs, consideration should be given to pipeline access 
        during the placement of the plugs and the resulting effects of the ground disturbance. 
        Where the pipeline crosses a wet area, a plug should be placed just downstream of 
        the wet area, to prevent its drainage, and also at an appropriate location upstream 
        of the wet area, to prevent the wet area contamination by water flowing along the 
        pipeline. The plugs should be long enough so that corrosion downstream of the plug 
        will not result in water entering the pipe.</p>
        <p>On slopes, water could seep into the pipeline through perforations and exit at 
        unacceptable locations such as agricultural areas or areas where excessive erosion 
        would result. The water should be allowed to exit at frequent intervals and at preferred 
        locations in order to minimize potential impacts from the flow of water and the disruption 
        to natural drainage patterns. Typical locations for plugs are provided in the following 
        table.</p>

        <p>The plugs should adhere to the pipe, be impermeable and non-shrinking, and able 
        to resist deterioration. Examples of suitable materials are concrete grout or polyurethane 
        foam. The use of impermeable earthen plugs may also be a viable option.</p>
        <p>In the case of pipeline removal, water pathways through the uncompacted pipeline 
        trench material must be prevented or interrupted. The principles governing the locations 
        of trench breakers are the same as those governing the locations of plugs for pipelines 
        abandoned in place.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_10">3.10 Associated Apparatus</h3>
        <p>The development of any abandonment plan should also give consideration to the disconnection, 
        removal and disposal of apparatus associated with the pipeline, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>aboveground valve sites and manifolds;</li>
          <li>underground valve sites and manifold piping, as well as protruding elements such 
          as valve topworks;</li>
          <li>underground tanks;</li>
          <li>pipeline scraper traps;</li>
          <li>pipeline risers;</li>
          <li>line heaters;</li>
          <li>drip pots;</li>
          <li>pipeline access culverts (e.g.&nbsp;for tie-ins, valves, liners, etc.);</li>
          <li>cathodic test posts, fink stations, rectifier sites, and ground beds (to a depth 
          of one metre);</li>
          <li>aboveground tanks and containment berms;</li>
          <li>access roads, gates, and fences;</li>
          <li>anchor blocks and steel piles; and</li>
          <li>miscellaneous apparatus such as radio antennae, buildings, fencing, wiring, electrical 
          equipment, and slope monitoring equipment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is recommended that all surface and subsurface apparatus (including signage) 
        along the route of a pipeline that is to be abandoned through removal also be removed 
        as part of the abandonment process.</p>
        <p>For pipeline sections that are to be abandoned in place, it is recommended that 
        all surface apparatus as well as subsurface apparatus to a depth of at least one metre 
        be removed, with the notable exception of signage identifying the location of the 
        buried line pipe (i.e.&nbsp;line markers and aerial markers). This applies to apparatus 
        located on operator owned land as well as apparatus located on pipeline-specific surface 
        leases on public or private land.</p>
        <p>Any apparatus that is left in place should be secured and properly marked and recorded, 
        and should not pose a hazard to people, equipment, or wildlife and livestock.</p>
        <h3 id="s3_11">3.11 Cost of Abandonment</h3>
        <p>The cost of abandoning a pipeline may be quite significant. There is a broad scope 
        of costs to consider, from the traditional costs associated with abandonment to more 
        intangible items such as a company's public image and the costs of environmental consequences. 
        In order to make responsible decisions regarding abandonment, all of these costs must 
        be considered.</p>
        <p>The cost of abandoning a pipeline will depend on the resources required to complete 
        the work, the value of any salvaged material, the extent of remediation and reclamation 
        work required (as well as any associated security requirements <sup>[8]</sup>), 
        and many other factors. Proponents should also consider the costs associated with 
        monitoring a site and potential future remediation, as well as the consequences of 
        the abandonment activities and any legal issues that may arise. Changes in the regulatory 
        environment may also give rise to unanticipated abandonment costs to ensure &quot;no responsibility by the owner/operator&quot; after a prescribed monitoring period.</p>
        <p class="small ">[8] For example, in Alberta, if an approval under EPEA is required  for the abandonment of a Class&nbsp;1 pipeline, security is to be provided to AEP 
        before the approval is issued. The security amount is determined using an estimate 
        of the cost of reclamation.</p>
        <div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
        <h2 id="s4">Section&nbsp;4 - Post-Abandonment Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Once a pipeline has been abandoned, the owner/operator may retain a number of responsibilities. 
        More particularly, the owner/operator may be responsible for ensuring that the right-of-way 
        and any facilities left in place remain free of problems associated with the abandonment. 
        For that reason, a right-of-way monitoring program should be included in the post-abandonment 
        plan and accounted for in the abandonment budget.</p>
        <p>Monitoring plans will vary from case to case, depending on the location and size 
        of the pipeline, the land use, and the features of the terrain traversed by the right-of-way 
        (such as water crossings or slopes). When developing a monitoring plan, the effects 
        of each abandonment issue described in <a href="#s3">Section&nbsp;3</a> should be 
        thoroughly examined for each specific segment of the pipeline being abandoned. 
        Specific monitoring requirements should be included for potentially sensitive areas.</p>
        <p>Right-of-way maintenance should also be considered in the post-abandonment monitoring 
        plan and factored as necessary into the abandonment budget. As noted in <a href="#s3_2">Section&nbsp;3.2</a>, the reclamation program will normally be designed to 
        ensure that the condition of the right-of-way is made at least equivalent to that existing just 
        prior to the commencement of abandonment activities, and as close as circumstances permit to 
        the condition of the land that existed prior to initial pipeline installation. The degree to which 
        the right-of-way has to be maintained in that state depends largely on land use and 
        environmental sensitivities. For pipe left in place, the owner/operator would normally 
        remain responsible for the maintenance of signage.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the owner/operator may be responsible for maintaining post-abandonment 
        information about the pipeline. This information should be recorded in a post-abandonment 
        log book, so that it is available when needed and can be turned over to an alternate 
        responsible authority if required by future regulations. The post-abandonment log 
        book should contain:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>any regulatory permits and conditions attached to permits (including reclamation 
          certificates);</li>
          <li>full particulars on any pipeline facilities abandoned in place, including a physical 
          description, location and depth of cover, plug locations, and details of any sections 
          filled with a solid material;</li>
          <li>copies of all past crossing agreements;</li>
          <li>records of post-abandonment aerial surveillances;</li>
          <li>records of any slumping over the pipe, or water flow through the pipe, that was 
          noted during post-abandonment monitoring;</li>
          <li>records of any changes in pipeline state from the original abandonment plan (e.g.&nbsp;if 
          pipe sections abandoned in place are subsequently removed);</li>
          <li>records of any remedial work performed on the pipeline after abandonment; and</li>
          <li>records of any areas that become contaminated after the abandonment and reclamation 
          work is complete.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The owner/operator will also be responsible for notifying landowners, municipal 
        authorities, and other affected parties (such as one-call associations) of the abandonment 
        of the pipeline. Any input provided by these groups should be recorded in the post-abandonment 
        log book.</p>
        <p>Finally, any pipeline abandoned in place should remain part of any provincial one-call 
        program, so that third parties can be advised whether the lines they wish to have 
        located are active or abandoned.</p>
        <p>In closing, a major issue still to be addressed is the question of who would assume 
        responsibility if the owner/operator becomes insolvent. In this regard, industry has 
        established a fund in Alberta to cover the cost of reclamation and abandonment of 
        orphaned oil and gas wells and certain associated pipeline facilities.</p>

        <h2 id="nxd">Appendix&nbsp;D - Cleaning Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>D.1 General Considerations</h3>
        <p>The operating history of the pipeline to be abandoned should be reviewed to enable 
        the planning of the specific cleaning procedures required for abandonment. Information 
        such as oil/gas analysis, piping modifications, operating flow records, records of 
        anomalies, and maintenance records may provide some insight into additional work needed 
        to develop an effective pipeline cleaning plan.</p>
        <p>The owner/operator should ensure that there are adequate sending and receiving 
        traps in place. This may require the use of temporary assemblies. If the pipeline 
        in question is part of a larger system, the section to be abandoned should be physically 
        disconnected upon completion of the cleaning process.</p>
        <p>Safety precautions appropriate to the in-service product hazards (i.e.&nbsp;flammability and explosivity of hydrocarbons, toxicity of sour products) must be established throughout the activity.</p>
        <p>For gas pipelines, any residual gas should be vented or flared once the pressure 
        in the pipeline has been reduced to the extent possible using operating facilities 
        or a pull down compressor. The residual gas should be monitored for signs of liquid.</p>
        <p>For liquid pipelines, before line flow ceases, a sufficient number of scraper pigs 
        should be run through the line to remove the bulk of any solids or waxy build-up. 
        As illustrated by the figure below, a batch of solvent-type hydrocarbons such as diesel 
        fuel or condensate inserted between two scraper pigs is recommended as an effective 
        method of reducing solids or waxy build-up. This process should be repeated until 
        solids can no longer be detected on the pigs as they are removed from the receiving 
        trap.</p>
        <p class="well well-sm mrgn-bttm-sm well well-sm mrgn-bttm-sm"><strong>Figure&nbsp;D-1<br>
        In-Service Initial Cleaning for Liquid Pipelines</strong></p>
        <img src="/prtcptn/pplnbndnmnt/mg/lqdhdrcrbn-eng.gif" alt="In-Service Initial Cleaning for Liquid Pipelines" width="466" height="107" class="center-block ">
        <p>Specialized chemical cleaning may be required if the routine cleaning method described 
          is not successful, if the pipeline is known to have an unusually high contamination 
          level, or if unusually high cleanliness standards are to be met. Special precautions 
          must be exercised when the pipeline is opened up to control vapour hazards of flammability, 
        explosiveness, and toxicity (e.g.&nbsp;hazardous compounds such as benzene).</p>
        <h3>D.2 Cleaning Methods for Natural Gas Pipelines</h3>
        <p>A stiff rubber scraping pig should be pushed through the pipeline (at a constant 
        speed consistent with the pig manufacturer's recommendation) using nitrogen or some 
        other inert gas to prevent explosive mixtures. Free liquids pushed ahead of the pig 
        may be either pushed into the downstream pipeline section or collected in a containment 
        tank designed and isolated according to prevailing local guidelines, for disposal 
        in accordance with area legislation or local by-laws. This process should be repeated 
        until free liquids are no longer evident by visual inspection. Low areas of the pipeline 
        should be checked for the collection of liquids or other contaminants.</p>
        <p>After these initial pigging runs, the pipeline should be checked for cleanliness. 
        If contamination is evident, the pigging procedure should be repeated using a slug 
        of solvent between two pigs. As with the free liquids, the solvent should be collected 
        in a containment tank and disposed of in accordance with area legislation or local 
        by-laws. Solvent fumes should be purged with nitrogen or a similar inert gas.</p>
        <h3>D.3 Cleaning Methods for Liquid Pipelines</h3>
        <p>Following completion of the initial in-service cleaning efforts, a final cleaning 
        step should be done in conjunction with line evacuation. The following procedure is 
        commonly used, although many variations exist which should be considered. Consultants 
        specializing in the cleaning of contaminated facilities can advise and provide plans 
        for both normal and unusual circumstances.</p>
        <p>A slug of liquid hydrocarbons having solvent properties such as condensate or diesel 
        fuel is pushed through the pipeline between two stiff rubber scraper pigs at a constant 
        speed by an inert gas such as nitrogen. Other additives or treatment chemicals may 
        be added if desired. As a rule of thumb, the volume should be calculated to maintain 
        a minimum pipe wall contact time by the fluid ranging from five to ten minutes (or 
        longer), depending on the effectiveness of the initial in-service cleaning process.</p>
        <p>For lines having encrusted or high paraffin build-up, an additional volume of solvent 
        preceding the first pig can be considered. All contact times should be increased for 
        excessive lengths of line as the solvent may become saturated with hydrocarbons before 
        completion of the run. The following diagram illustrates the pipeline sequence of 
        movement. At the endpoint, the solvent and hydrocarbons are pushed into another section 
        of pipeline or collected in a containment tank for disposal.</p>
        <p class="well well-sm mrgn-bttm-sm well well-sm mrgn-bttm-sm"><strong>Figure&nbsp;D-2 - Final Cleaning and Evaluation for Liquid Pipelines</strong></p>
        <img src="/prtcptn/pplnbndnmnt/mg/nrtgs-eng.gif" alt="Final Cleaning and Evaluation for Liquid Pipelines" width="345" height="64" class="center-block ">
        <p>A repeat run of the pig train described above should be conducted if there are 
        any indications of liquids or contaminants remaining on the pipe wall in excess of 
        the established cleanliness criteria. The effectiveness of the cleaning process can 
        be gauged by either obtaining samples of the solvent near the tail end of the passing 
        batch, at approximate 25&nbsp;km intervals, and analyzing the samples for hydrocarbon 
        content, or by monitoring the quality and quantity of the solvent hydrocarbons expelled 
        from the line and comparing it with that injected.</p>

                The following FAQs explain how the Board has implemented changes
                to who can participate in the Board’s hearings for pipelines and
                power lines under the NEB Act. These changes were set out in the
                <em>National Energy Board Act</em> by the 2012
                <em>Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act</em>. This
                approach is used for all applications under the NEB Act for
                which hearing is held.

                participation in fair and efficient proceedings as it carries
                out its mandate in the Canadian public interest.

                <strong>What is the legal basis for standing?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally, a person ought to be heard when that person could be
                impacted by the decision, subject to certain legal restrictions.
                This is a legal entitlement to be heard. This legal entitlement
                may be reflected in the NEB Act or other Acts, such as the
                <a
                  href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-15.21/index.html"
                  rel="external"
                  ><em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em></a
                >. Even if legislation is silent, standing to be heard is
                required by the common law (law that is made by the courts),
                through the application of the principles of natural justice.
                The Board is required to follow these principles because it is
                considered to be a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal
                (Quasi-judicial means that the Board has decision-making and
                other powers that are similar to those of a court).
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to a legal right to be heard, the Board can also use
                its discretion to give someone standing if they have relevant
                information or expertise. A person may have information that a
                decision-maker needs or wants to make its decision, and, as a
                result, his or her participation may add value to or assist a
                tribunal in making its decision. As the master of its own
                procedure, the Board has discretion to allow these people to
                participate.

                <strong>What is natural justice?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally, there are two components to the principles of natural
                justice and fairness. First, a party must have an adequate
                opportunity to be heard before a decision is made affecting that
                party’s interest. The second component is that the decision must
                be made by an independent and impartial decision-maker.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among other things, the principles of natural justice require
                that a person be given an adequate opportunity to be heard
                before a decision is made affecting their interests. There still
                needs to be a sufficiently direct impact to trigger a natural
                justice right to participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The content of the principles of natural justice and fairness
                will vary from case to case. Essentially, what is “fair”
                requires a balance between what is necessary for the effective
                and efficient performance of public duties, as mandated under an
                empowering statute, and what is necessary for the protection of
                the interests of the parties affected.
              </p>

                  >Is standing the same thing as level of participation?</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                No. Standing refers to the ability to participate. Level of
                participation refers to how someone can participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                To have standing means that you are allowed to make
                representations to the Board and that the Board will consider
                this information before making its decision or recommendation on
                an application. These representations could be oral or only in
                writing. Typically, participants with standing in a hearing are
                Commenters, Intervenors, and the company who made the
                application (Applicant).
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have standing, the next step is for the Board to
                determine how you can participate, or the level of participation
                that you should be granted. That determination may rely on what
                the NEB Act says, natural justice considerations, or be a
                discretionary decision based on any number of factors. Practical
                or logistical factors may include the type of evidence required
                by the Board (technical versus Traditional Knowledge as an
                example), the capabilities of participants, and fairness and
                efficiency of the proceedings. Number of participants and time
                limits for the assessment process may also be a factor in the
                levels of participation available and how much time may be
                allowed for each Participant.

                any Act will prevail over common law requirements. The Board
                also looked at the context, purpose and objectives of the NEB
                Act and CEAA&nbsp;2012.

                Common law principles of natural justice were also used. As
                noted above, these principles apply to the Board in its exercise
                of its quasi-judicial functions, such as application assessment.

              </p>
              <p>The Board will consider whether you are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>directly affected or</li>

              <p>
                If you are directly affected, you
                <strong><em>will</em></strong> be allowed to participate. If you
                have relevant information or expertise, the Board
                <strong><em>may</em></strong> allow you to participate.

                No. The wording in the NEB Act and the CEAA&nbsp;2012 are
                slightly different.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the CEAA&nbsp;2012, the Board must provide any interested
                party with an opportunity to participate in the environmental
                assessment of a project that falls under CEAA&nbsp;2012.
                Interested party is defined as a person who, in the Board’s
                opinion, is directly affected or who has relevant information or
                expertise.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, for those projects that require a CEAA&nbsp;2012
                environmental assessment, the Board will use the broader
                standing test set out in CEAA&nbsp;2012, and
                <strong><em>will</em></strong> grant standing to those people
                who are directly affected <strong><em>and</em></strong> to those
                people who have relevant information or expertise to provide
                information or comment on the environmental assessment.

              <p>
                There are sections of the NEB Act where there is no standing
                test set out. In those sections, the Board has provided guiding
                principles for its standing decisions. Since the goal and
                foundations for standing are the similar for all types of
                applications, the Board created a similar test to the one in the
                NEB Act. The Board has called this
                <a href="/prtcptn/hrng/prtcptnthrhrnggdnc-eng.html"
                  >Non-Statutory Guidance on Participation in NEB Hearings</a
                >. This guidance, with some exceptions,<sup
                  ><a href="#ftn1back" id="ftn1">[1]</a></sup
                >
                is intended to be used when section&nbsp;55.2 does not apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will allow you to participate if your interest is
                sufficiently impacted by the Board’s decision. Standing may also
                be granted if the Board finds your participation would assist
                the Board’s decision-making. You can fall into either or both of
                these categories.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                To be sufficiently impacted, you need to demonstrate an interest
                that is impacted and that the decision on the application would
                cause a sufficient impact to that interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board decides on a case-by-case basis who is sufficiently
                impacted. The Board will consider the nature of your interest,
                and whether you have specific and detailed interest, rather than
                a general public interest. Examples of interests that could
                support participation, depending on the type of application, are
                commercial, property or other financial interest (including
                employment); personal use and occupancy of land and resources;
                or use of land and resources for traditional Aboriginal
                purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also considers whether the decision on the application
                causes a sufficient impact on your interest. For example, it
                looks at whether your interest relates to issues that are
                relevant to the hearing, the likelihood that the Board’s
                decision will impact your interest, and whether your interest
                may be impacted to a sufficient degree.

              </p>
              <p>
                The Board considers, on the facts of each case, the source of
                your knowledge (for example, local, regional, Aboriginal); your
                qualifications (for example, if you have specialist knowledge
                and expertise); the extent to which the information relates to
                the application; and how much your participation will add value
                to, or assist the Board in making, its decision.

              </p>
              <p>
                No. There are no guaranteed level of procedural rights for a
                person granted standing.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you apply to participate, you will identify your preferred
                method of participating.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the Board determines that you are allowed to participate,
                it will decide how you can participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will provide the process and participation rights it
                decides are appropriate for you to have your representations
                considered by the Board. In making its decision, the Board must
                comply with the principles of natural justice and requirements
                in the NEB Act, or other relevant Acts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process and participation rights given to a hearing
                participant will depend on the circumstances. An oral portion of
                a hearing, with cross-examination and oral final argument, is
                not always required for every hearing. Some hearings will be
                conducted entirely in writing.

              </p>
              <p>
                No. You are provided the opportunity to participate, but you are
                not required to do so. For example, if you are allowed to
                participate and granted Intervenor status, you do not have to
                file written evidence, ask questions or provide final arguments,
                but you have the opportunity to do so. If you are not planning
                to do any of these things, it may be better for you to ask to be
                a Commenter. Being an active Intervenor requires a commitment of
                time and effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you decide to exercise those participation rights, you must
                also fulfill the responsibilities that are associated with those
                rights. For example, if you decide to file written evidence, it
                is your responsibility to serve (send a copy of) that evidence
                to all the other parties by the deadline set by the Board.

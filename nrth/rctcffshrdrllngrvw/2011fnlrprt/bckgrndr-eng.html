            On 20&nbsp;April&nbsp;2010, an explosion on a drilling platform in
            the Gulf of Mexico caused the rig to sink and killed
            11&nbsp;workers. The Deepwater Horizon incident also caused one of
            the largest oil spills in history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the world, people watched in disbelief as millions of barrels
            of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. How could this happen? Is it
            possible to safely drill offshore while protecting the environment?
            What do we do when things go wrong? What can we learn from incidents
            like the <em>Deepwater Horizon</em>?
          </p>
          <p>
            Within days of the incident, the National Energy Board (NEB or the
            Board) announced that we would review safety and environmental
            requirements for offshore drilling in Canada’s Arctic. We called it
            the Arctic Review. The objective was to gather information and
            knowledge through meaningful engagement and dialogue.

            <strong>What were the key findings from the Arctic Review?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We felt it was important to listen to those who would be most
            affected by Arctic offshore drilling. Beginning in
            November&nbsp;2010, we held more than 40 meetings in 11 communities
            across Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
          </p>
          <p>
            We listened carefully to the people who told us that we were not
            only accountable to Northern residents and to all Canadians, but we
            also had a great responsibility to the North itself. We take this
            responsibility seriously. It’s our job to make sure that any company
            wishing to drill in the Canadian Arctic offshore has plans that are
            safe for workers, the public, and the environment. If the company
            can’t provide these, they can’t drill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the Arctic Review, people in the North told us that they
            understood the importance of energy and were not opposed to
            development, but not necessarily anywhere or at any cost. They also
            said that, if companies are going to drill in the Canadian Arctic
            offshore, it must be done right.
          </p>
          <p>
            The people we met at the community meetings reminded us that they
            are deeply connected to the land and the ocean. They have been
            taught by their Elders that if you take care of the land, the land
            will take care of you. We also heard that if there was a drilling
            accident in the Arctic offshore, life in the North could change
            irrevocably.
          </p>
          <p>
            We learned that the root cause of most industrial accidents,
            including offshore drilling blowouts, is the lack of a broadly
            shared safety culture. This is caused by inadequate, or inadequately
            implemented, management systems. In other words, people don’t do
            what they are supposed to.
          </p>
          <p>
            We re-affirmed our Same Season Relief Well Policy: the applicant
            must demonstrate, in its Contingency Plan, the capability to drill a
            relief well to kill an out of control well during the same drilling
            season. The intended outcome of this policy is to minimize harmful
            impacts on the environment. We will continue to require that any
            company applying for an offshore drilling authorization provides us
            with specific details as to how they will meet this policy. An
            applicant wishing to depart from our policy would have to
            demonstrate how they would meet or exceed the intended outcome of
            our policy. It would be up to us to determine, on a case-by-case
            basis, which tools are appropriate for meeting or exceeding the
            intended outcome of the Same Season Relief Well Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was through this extensive, open, and public information and
            knowledge gathering that the Board developed the Arctic Review
            Report and our
            <em
              >Filing Requirements for Offshore Drilling in the Canadian
              Arctic</em
            >. While there are currently no applications for offshore drilling
            before us, we expect to see such applications in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our regulatory regime has the tools we need to protect the safety of
            Northern residents, workers, and the Arctic environment. We
            recognize that if we approve Arctic offshore drilling in the future,
            we need to do all we can to reduce the risk of an incident. This
            includes making sure that we have staff with the experience, skill,
            and know-how to see that the facilities we regulate are safe,
            secure, and operated in a way that protects the environment.
            Finally, we all need to be ready to respond effectively if an
            incident does happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Northern residents have been clear that they want to be involved in
            preparing for potential drilling in the future. Industry told us
            they agree that Northern residents have a key role to play. This
            starts with training opportunities before an application is filed.
            We agree too.

          <p>
            In June&nbsp;2010, we released the scope of topics for the Arctic
            Review after carefully considering comments from more than 60 groups
            and individuals. Once we had decided which topics to examine, we
            began to gather the best available information on offshore drilling.
            We asked participants in the Arctic Review to send us any
            information they thought we should consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            We sent out two sets of questions for participants. These questions,
            or Calls for Information, asked participants to provide information
            about the topics included in the Arctic Review scope. In response,
            we received thousands of pages of information. We asked experts to
            prepare a number of studies. We also examined reports on the
            <span class="invisible">Deepwater Horizon</span> incident, and
            others like it, to see what we could learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we held a week-long Roundtable meeting in Inuvik, Northwest
            Territories so participants could have face-to-face dialogue to
            understand the information that had been submitted and comment on
            the issues being considered in the Arctic Review. Five of our Board
            Members participated in the Roundtable to hear first-hand from
            participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly 200&nbsp;people attended our Arctic Review Roundtable in
            September&nbsp;2011. Another 300&nbsp;people logged on to their
            computers to listen to the live web broadcast, which was interpreted
            into Inuvialuktun, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Gwich’in, and French.
            Others listened to the broadcast over their telephones.
          </p>

            >
          </p>
          <p>We will expect applicants to make public their:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Safety Plans;</li>
            <li>Contingency Plans;</li>
            <li>
              Emergency Response Plans (if such plans exist separately from
              other Contingency Plans);
            </li>
            <li>and Environmental Protection Plans.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In their application, we require an applicant to submit a
            Contingency Plan that outlines what measures they will use to
            respond to an out of control well. A relief well is one contingency
            measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Roundtable meeting in Inuvik we heard that, while relief
            wells are one option for killing a well that has gone out of
            control, there may be other methods which would achieve the same
            goal. Other participants said that, while they agree with the goal
            of regaining control of a well as soon as possible and not relying
            solely on a relief well, they had concerns about not including same
            season relief well capability as a tool in an operator’s toolbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will continue to require an operator to use all intervention
            techniques available, in addition to a relief well, so that the flow
            from an out of control well can be stopped as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p class="well well-sm mrgn-bttm-sm" id="s4">
            <strong>How should we respond when things go wrong?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are the lead agency for emergencies related to drilling and
            production in the Canadian Arctic.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Roundtable, we heard speakers from all backgrounds and
            interests say that the prevention of an oil spill in the Canadian
            Arctic offshore is the primary goal and desire of all parties. The
            experience of the past tells us to prepare for the worst case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spill response is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. We heard
            information on the universal principle of a “tiered spill response”,
            where the strategy selected to respond to a spill depends, in part,
            on the size of the spill.
          </p>

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If an oil spill was to occur in the Arctic offshore, the effects on
            the environment and animals could be immediate. When determining the
            appropriate form and amount of financial responsibility for offshore
            Arctic drilling, we find it desirable that sufficient financial
            resources will be available to address loss or damage, and that a
            portion of these funds be available to quickly compensate people of
            the Arctic. There is no upper limit on the amount that we may
            require as proof of financial responsibility from a company.

            <strong>What Have we Learned?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of the Arctic Review, we committed to examining the lessons
            learned from accidents, incidents, and emergency response exercises.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we look at the root causes of many incidents, we find a common
            thread: a neglect of, or even an absence of, processes and
            procedures to identify, mitigate, or eliminate potential risks.
            Beneath that deficiency lies an even deeper pattern of
            organizational cultures that did not put safety first. An
            organization’s safety culture is made up of individual employee and
            group beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviours about safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any company wishing to drill in the Canadian Arctic must demonstrate
            to us that they have a strong safety culture. We will hold the
            companies that we regulate accountable for developing a robust
            safety culture and we will audit their operations to observe and
            validate that safety culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the learnings that we gathered through the Arctic Review
            have been incorporated into the filing requirements for future
            applications for offshore drilling in the Canadian Arctic.

          <p class="well well-sm mrgn-bttm-sm" id="s7">
            <strong>What are the Filing Requirements?</strong>

              in the Canadian Arctic</em
            >
            is the companion document to the Arctic Review Report. The filing
            requirements specify the information that the Board will need to see
            in order to assess future applications for drilling in the Canadian
            Arctic offshore.
          </p>
          <p>
            The filing requirements, which are available on our website, include
            detailed technical requirements, many of which were taken from Calls
            for Information issued during the Arctic Review.

            As we prepare for the future, we will work collaboratively with land
            claim organizations throughout the North and continue to listen to
            those who will be most affected by offshore drilling in the Canadian

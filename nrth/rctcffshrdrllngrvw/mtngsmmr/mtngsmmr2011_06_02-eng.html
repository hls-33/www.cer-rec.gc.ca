                  what has occurred to date including stakeholder meetings and

                <li>funding</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Questions and Comments:</strong></p>
              <p>The following questions and comments were posed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Does the National Energy Board conduct technical reviews or is
                  it done through a third party?
                </li>
                <li>
                  It was mentioned that there are no applications at this time.
                  How many have there been in the past?
                </li>
                <li>Why do this Review now?</li>
                <li>
                  What is the format for the Roundtable - will the Board Members
                  be up front like in a hearing?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Has the National Energy Board considered breaking into smaller
                  sessions? Northerners may feel more comfortable in smaller
                  sessions. These smaller groups could be on specific themes.
                  Could have the larger circle to start off with and then break
                  into the smaller sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Will people who submitted information be making presentations
                  at the Roundtable?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How will the Roundtable be managed? If the Roundtable is for a
                  week, how will the National Energy Board control people coming
                  and going and making presentations?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Will the speakers be known prior to the start of the
                  Roundtable or can people walk in and make a presentation?
                </li>
                <li>Is pre-registration required to make a presentation?</li>
                <li>
                  Glad to hear of the open concept for the Roundtable. In other
                  situations where there have been consultations with
                  governments or companies this hasn't been the case. There is
                  great value in everyone hearing the same information. There
                  will be no misinformation in one person hearing something that
                  others haven't.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What would be the role of industry at the Roundtable? Do they
                  have to register like other participants?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are any other government departments going to be there?
                  Imagine the National Energy Board is getting questions about
                  other jurisdictions and other departments. Will they be there
                  to answer the questions?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Who is the Chief Conservation Officer? Does he have any
                  northern experience?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are there written criteria or guidance for when the Chief
                  Conservation Officer takes a matter to the Board?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are the results of the inspections that are carried out posted
                  on a public registry?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Although the mandate of the National Energy Board is
                  understood, when it comes to environmental protection, can't
                  find any environmental regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a company says they aren't going to do a contingency plan,
                  there is no regulation that says they have to. Is the only
                  thing the National Energy Board can do is not to give an
                  approval?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Find it odd that multi-national companies are going ahead and
                  discharging chemicals into the water. There are no regulations
                  for this, just conditions. This is an industry that operates
                  different than any other industry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Has any oil and gas company ever been charged under by the
                  National Energy Board for environmental damages?
                </li>
                <li>
                  With the benefit of 35&nbsp;years of experience, there have
                  been problems. Many times pipes get stuck and the remedy is to
                  dump large volumes of diesel oil to get the pipe unstuck. This
                  was no big deal for COGLA for companies to mix the diesel oil
                  with the mud. There has been a disagreement on this with
                  Environment Canada for years. Industry was against using
                  mineral oil fluids as there was no room on the rig. They had
                  plenty of diesel oil though. Companies said the stuck pipe was
                  a safety matter so made it into a safety issue and used the
                  diesel oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Companies had old barite on the rig and needed new. They asked
                  COGLA if they could dump the old stuff overboard and COGLA
                  said yes. Environment Canada charged the company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The National Energy Board says it regulates safety and the
                  environment but looking at the guidelines and regulations,
                  nothing has changed in 10, 20, 30&nbsp;years. The only stick
                  the National Energy Board has is to withdraw an authorization.
                  How can the National Energy Board regulate without
                  regulations?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Every regulation comes with a penalty. In fact for this there
                  is no penalty, just a fear factor to lose an approval. Failure
                  to comply with conditions results in a complaint and not a
                  penalty. Companies will make an economic decision about
                  dumping diesel oil into the Beaufort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The National Energy Board has a good electronic registry for
                  hearings but once it ends and something is approved there is
                  nothing further. The other boards (Land and Water Boards)
                  track projects all the way through (various terms of licences,
                  plans that have to be filed) and maintain distribution lists.
                  Why can't the National Energy Board scan inspection results,
                  etc. so people can see this ongoing information online? This
                  is transparent so people can see what is happening. Things are
                  done differently in the North and if the National Energy Board
                  is going to continue to work here it needs to get a good
                  electronic registry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are some extremely good examples of information on the
                  internet for projects that have been funded by the World Bank
                  (ie: Esso in Chad). It is a requirement of the World Bank that
                  all environmental documents be posted on the internet,
                  including compliance records on a month by month basis. World
                  Bank funded projects all over the world seem to have higher
                  standards. The main players in the Mackenzie Gas Project (MGP)
                  contributed to these international standards but when asked in
                  the MGP process, they said absolutely no - they would just do
                  the bare minimum. Higher level of standards that are applied
                  in third world countries are not applied in this country, in
                  this jurisdiction because of money. These include Arctic and
                  sub-Arctic standards.

                <li>
                  During the Review, if issues are raised for matters that DIAND
                  is responsible for, is it recorded or just said that is it not
                  part of this Review? Will there be a section in the Report of
                  what the National Energy Board has heard that is outside its
                  mandate and make recommendations? These could be matters that
                  are in the public interest even though outside the mandate of
                  the National Energy Board.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is not a matter of how to regulate, but if it should happen
                  in the first place (rights issuance matter).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the National Energy Board throws things out the window it
                  heard that is outside its mandate that is no way to run a
                  Review.

                  It is one thing for INAC to come to a meeting to hear what is
                  said, but making recommendations on things they have heard
                  should be done.

                  How many years has it been since the National Energy Board has
                  regulated any offshore drilling?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What sort of capacity does the National Energy Board (and its
                  staff) have to deal with this stuff? How many staff have even
                  worked or been offshore? Has there been any assessment done
                  regarding capacity in case a bunch of applications come in?
                </li>
                <li>
                  The National Energy Board mostly deals with pipelines and the
                  odd COGOA application. Without meaning any disrespect, has any
                  assessment been done as to what capacity the staff at the
                  National Energy Board have? On the east coast, that is what
                  they do but not at the National Energy Board. Is there a
                  public report on what should be in place, what is in place and
                  what the gaps are? That is something that should be done.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Have any extensions been granted to BP, ExxonMobil or Imperial
                  for the timeframe of when they have to drill by? Since the
                  blowout in the Gulf and this Review, companies requested an
                  extension. Has this happened?
                </li>
                <li>
                  ConocoPhillips has definite plans to develop the Amauligak for
                  production. Once the well was capped they knew what was there.
                  How long do they have? Is it in perpetuity?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Having an eye on what can be learned from other incidents is
                  good. There is much information on the internet. There is a
                  three page report from the inventor of the Macondo BOP. It did
                  all but predict the BOP would fail when going deeper and
                  deeper and the pipe getting smaller and smaller. It said can't
                  go indefinitely without a failure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can achieve the highest degree of safety by studying risk
                  assessments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the February update from the National Energy Board there
                  was mention of four contracts for studies. Who is doing the
                  comparative assessment of regulatory regimes and when will it
                  be available?
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is a three page backgrounder the National Energy Board
                  did. Has any thought been given to having a comparative study
                  done on how financial responsibility is handled in different
                  regimes?
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the beginning when the National Energy Board was looking at
                  the scope, Alternatives North registered to be involved. Why
                  not fund such organizations to do studies? Who has the funds
                  to participate, the experience and the background -
                  government, if they choose to participate? They did not do so
                  in MGP.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How did the National Energy Board decide not to provide
                  participant funding but only fund travel costs? Providing
                  participant funding would result in more balanced information,
                  debate and discussions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are organizations that have no paid staff and operate on
                  a volunteer basis. Without participant funding these
                  organizations can't meaningfully participate. There won't be
                  anyone going to the Roundtable. Like tonight, attendance is on
                  a volunteer basis. Having participant funding for project
                  facility hearings is one thing but not for something as
                  important as this it is not right. Years ago there was lots of
                  work and suggestions for participant funding and the National
                  Energy Board is interpreting it in a narrow way and applying
                  it to facilities only. Without participant funding, the
                  National Energy Board will get a lopsided result for this
                  Review.

                <li>
                  How much was the security for financial responsibility and in
                  what form was it for the DevonPaktoa?
                </li>
                <li>How much security was required for the 1989 drilling?</li>
                <li>
                  Worried that the National Energy Board will license something
                  in the Beaufort and if there is a blowout the company won't be
                  able to cover the cost. The company could go bankrupt. The
                  provisions under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement will end up
                  with the taxpayers being on the hook.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless the National Energy Board deals with financial
                  responsibility properly, the taxpayer will end up on the hook.
                  The track record of DIAND on mining reclamations is appalling.
                  Any junior company would not be able to afford to put up
                  adequate security.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using audited financial statements as proof of financial
                  responsibility is crazy. Want a Letter of Credit as a
                  requirement based on worst case scenario under the Inuvialuit
                  Final Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Audited financial statements are not adequate especially after
                  what happened in the Gulf. The cost would be even higher here
                  and probably a spill would never be able to be cleaned up.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless more than $75&nbsp;million is put up, there shouldn't
                  be any drilling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless the cap can be raised and security held drilling
                  shouldn't happen. Putting up security shouldn't be
                  discretionary, it should be mandatory.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are contaminated sites across the three northern
                  territories. It is costing billions and is all on the taxpayer
                  and on the public accounts as liabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  $75&nbsp;million would be a small clean up. Clean up costs of
                  a spill in the Beaufort stagger the mind.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Considering using audited financial statements is just not
                  acceptable in today's world.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There was a summary of learnings given in Portland last week -
                  need to rethink on the basis of worst case scenarios and not
                  probable case scenarios.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One month before the Gulf blowout, heard from companies
                  meeting in Tuktoyaktuk that blowouts are no longer a problem,
                  they have it all figured out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hearing the same issues today that was heard 30&nbsp;years
                  ago.
                </li>
                <li>
                  May be time to rethink worst case scenario. On the other hand
                  this would mean that junior companies wouldn't be able to
                  participate. Only the biggest companies would.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The National Energy Board should produce a document that shows
                  how the National Energy Board manages financial responsibility
                  under COGOA in comparison with other jurisdictions for
                  offshore drilling. Consider this a formal recommendation to
                  the National Energy Board in this Review.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Norway leads the world for standards and regulations. They
                  obtained enormous wealth through high royalties and have been
                  prudent with investments. They are by far the leaders for
                  environmental regulations.

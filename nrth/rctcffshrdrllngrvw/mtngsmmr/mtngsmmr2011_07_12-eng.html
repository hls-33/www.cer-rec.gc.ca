              <p><strong>Questions and Comments:</strong></p>
              <p>The following questions and comments were posed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Why isn't the line straight on the map between the Yukon and
                  Alaska [boundary between Canada and the U.S. in the Beaufort
                  Sea extending northward along 141&nbsp;degrees West]?
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the yellow part on the map [slide&nbsp;6], there are three
                  different land claim areas. Maybe the boundaries should be
                  shown.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once devolution takes place are companies able to do whatever
                  they choose and not have to answer to the NEB?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What kinds of agreements would there be with the US if there
                  is a spill? Need to be prepared. The current will spread the
                  oil quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are so many holes out there sooner or later a spill will
                  happen. Need to be prepared.
                </li>
                <li>Who appoints the Board Members and how are they chosen?</li>
                <li>What legislation gives the NEB the force of law?</li>
                <li>
                  Does the NEB regulate the liability and does the government
                  backstop the cost?
                </li>
                <li>
                  [Inuvialuit Regional Corporation] IRC has already given
                  approval for the Benefits Plans and Exploratory Licences. From
                  experience with private industry, once a contract is granted,
                  small businesses are phased out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  NEB has been getting the information from the people at the
                  local level.
                </li>
                <li>
                  NEB approved the last well on the basis that a relief well
                  could be drilled but the whole time the rig was in Inuvik.
                  Glad there have been changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Looking to use CO<sub>2</sub> - if they use CO<sub>2</sub>
                  they will kill animals in that area.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a company gets permission and makes a discovery when they
                  find oil and close off the well after discovery, how secure is
                  the well? Down there with salt water, how long can they be
                  safe? If they find oil in next five&nbsp;years, production is
                  a long way off. How safe are the wells?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a company goes belly up, does the federal government pay?
                </li>
                <li>
                  A company showed a video of shearing. This was all simulated
                  in a dry environment. Can they do this in the water? No
                  satisfied this can be done.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Really pushing for same season relief well. The ocean is so
                  large.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There was a lot of offshore drilling in the '70's and '80's.
                  There were lots of close calls and near fatalities. Is this
                  information available to the NEB? That drilling was not even
                  close to multi-year ice. No human/safety technology that can
                  withstand multi-year ice. Drill ships are like little ants in
                  comparison.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This review is just to get prepared and then is each
                  application reviewed on its own?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Has the NEB sat down face to face with the [Inuvialuit
                  Regional Corporation] IRC?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Marine mammal observers need to be added to the wildlife and
                  environmental monitors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wildlife and environmental monitors are being told what safety
                  gear to wear. Right now the companies have wildlife monitors
                  wearing rubber gloves. In the winter they are not allowed to
                  wear their traditional clothing. [Inuvialuit Lands
                  Administration] ILA is supplying monitors the majority of the
                  time and should have a say. Contractors have their standards
                  and if we don't meet them can't work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Will [Department of Fisheries and Oceans] DFO be at the
                  Roundtable?
                </li>
                <li>Is the $300,000 participant funding?</li>
                <li>
                  There was mention that the Board is neutral. Will there be a
                  [<em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</em>] CEAA process?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the proponent doesn't have the money to respond to an
                  accident, why would they get an approval?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once the Gulf [of Mexico] spill happened there was a picture
                  of the [Chief Executive Officer] CEO on a sailboat. That
                  wasn't right.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We are paying for the Gulf [of Mexico] spill at the gas pumps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whoever gives approval is equally guilty if there is a spill.
                  Everyone involved all the way up through the process from the
                  [Hunters and Trappers Committee] HTCs up. The first is the
                  NEB.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the past year to a year and a half there has been talk
                  about going offshore. IRC won't support this as there are only
                  a handful of jobs but there are all different kinds of
                  benefits. Small businesses are glad the IRC is not in charge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  NEB is listening better now than even three&nbsp;years ago.
                  This is good for the Inuvialuit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If there is a spill on the Canadian side, Canada is
                  responsible. If the spill is on the US side, the US is
                  responsible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the event there is a spill close to the border and Canadian
                  standards are higher for clean up, does the US only have to
                  follow their standards?
                </li>
                <li>
                  East and west currents will spread a spill more than on land.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Were the workshops with Imperial part of the drilling
                  requirements? Will it be a requirement in the future? This
                  generation was not here when the last drilling happened. The
                  workshops should be done as it was an eye opener.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the '70's and '80's there were long drawn out negotiations.
                  Times are changing though drastically. Not as many families
                  are spending time together going out on the land. IFA paved
                  the way but things are different - have to buy groceries so
                  need jobs. This is paving the way for future generations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In five&nbsp;years it will be a different community if
                  everything works as planned - road to Inuvik, oil and gas
                  development, tourism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Basically the NEB is looking at the first part (exploration).
                  Looking at things today, Tuktoyaktuk is the only capable
                  harbor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Times are changing and values are changing. IFA is keeping the
                  values but preparing the generations of today.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Everyone should understand there are two stages - exploration
                  and production - some in the community are gung ho to do this
                  but some still want to make sure the environment is protected.
                  Some of our own people think money is all powerful and some
                  can't afford to go get gas and go out to get a caribou.
                </li>
                <li>Offshore is more sensitive then near shore.</li>
                <li>Glad you are here and listening to us.</li>
                <li>
                  IFA was based on land use. Everything is a give and take. Need
                  to know there is something down the road for our kids and
                  their kids.
                </li>

                  What is really important - proponents need to be able to pay
                  for all the costs. It is not right that Canadians would have
                  to pay.

                  Same season relief wells will be heard about a lot in Inuvik.
                  Companies should know exactly what to expect.
                </li>
                <li>Infrastructure is also important.</li>
                <li>
                  Main concern is liability - if companies can't prove that they
                  have the money, don't give them approval.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The same season relief well issue is a big issue for all
                  communities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't know how it [same season relief well] can be done.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Never see small businesses come to meetings. The same thing in
                  the past. Some come but some don't. They should be here.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If there is ever a blowout we will be the first out there to
                  see where the oil is going.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How much oil was recovered from the Gulf [of Mexico] spill?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are emergency response exercises just a table top exercise?
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the operations phase who would make sure companies are
                  doing what they are supposed to?
                </li>
                <li>
                  It used to be shallow water but now it is going to be deep
                  water for the drilling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What about the ice and fog? How can the environment be
                  protected with this?
                </li>
                <li>
                  The well was supposed to have relief capabilities. The relief
                  capability equipment was sitting in Inuvik. The question is
                  who is going to be there making sure what was said and what is
                  happening is the same? They were supposed to be able to drive
                  out on the ice and it wasn't there.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If wildlife and environmental monitors report to the NEB and
                  not to the company won't need to worry about losing their
                  jobs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dispersants are no good. Why do they want to use them? It is
                  looking for trouble using them in harsh weather. It isn't
                  clean, it is dirty. Need to watch what animals are eating. The
                  best thing to use is a boom. Dispersants will make float away
                  with the current and not fall to the bottom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the Roundtable, can the NEB come back and explain the
                  Final Report?
                </li>
                <li>
                  From the last go round of drilling there were lots of tests on
                  oil and ice. This should be information the NEB can use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Those that go to the Roundtable should come back and report to
                  the communities. Most of the time there is no feedback.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Why are we not being compensated for our time? You want our
                  knowledge - some have more than others - and you want to know
                  what we know and understand and have accumulated for
                  generations. Don't realize that this is worth something. Our
                  time is as valuable as your time.

                <li>
                  Leave the ocean the way it is. There are other parts of the
                  ocean that should remain untouched as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Last time companies started activities we had no say.
                  Companies ganged up on us. Companies were given licences to
                  explore without any say from us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Economics and social side are not included but should be.
                  There is an option to look at this under the [Inuvialuit Fnal
                  Agreement] IFA. This was done for the Mackenzie Gas Project
                  with the Joint Review Panel. This goes beyond the environment
                  and should include the economics and social side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Government of Canada isn't ready yet. They are giving out
                  permits. What is the government's position if a company goes
                  bankrupt?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What did generations get out of traditional knowledge they
                  learned. The hope is that generations will be protected. This
                  information should be worth compensation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the pipeline bursts are they prepared to clean it up fast?
                  There is a fast current even though they try to contain it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How much time is the Review going to take - is it a one shot
                  deal?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Concerned for the Inuvialuit. You have education and
                  computers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Will companies be prepared if there is a spill. It will be
                  disastrous for the Inuvialuit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do you need a public hearing for drilling 100&nbsp;miles out?
                </li>
                <li>
                  There have been disasters in the middle of the ocean. It would
                  be disastrous here.

                  Meetings in November or January/February would be better.

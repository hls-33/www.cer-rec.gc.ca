              <p><strong>Questions and Comments:</strong></p>
              <p>The following questions and comments were posed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Since the Gulf of Mexico incident are the old procedures and
                  policies still being used for any company planning to drill in
                  the Arctic?
                </li>
                <li>Who is the Benefits Plan for?</li>
                <li>What is in the regulations?</li>
                <li>
                  Is there anything in the regulations that deals specifically
                  with the Arctic environment (cold, dark, ice, currents)?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are there different regulations for the Beaufort Sea, Baffin
                  Bay and Davis Strait? These areas are different. This area is
                  completely different that around Tuktoyaktuk. They have wind
                  but not the water current that is in our area. Are the
                  regulations designed only for one area?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How many pages were the old regulations before the new
                  regulations were added?
                </li>
                <li>
                  We never had concerns about regulations before but now we
                  would like to see what is in them that will help and benefit
                  us. These should be sent to the QIA, Hamlet office or directly
                  to us. For my environment and the animals we need to see how
                  they will help us.
                </li>
                <li>Can we also get copies of policies and procedures?</li>
                <li>
                  Can you tell us about the depth where drilling can happen? Is
                  there a difference in depth where companies can drill and
                  cannot?
                </li>
                <li>
                  I would like to welcome you. I am glad you are in town. I have
                  a lot to say.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If we ask companies not to drill will they keep doing it
                  anyways?
                </li>
                <li>
                  We have summer, fall, etc but our seasons are shorter than in
                  the South. Can the Board condition that drilling stop when the
                  ice is moving around and when animals are in the area moving
                  around?
                </li>
                <li>
                  As of this summer companies want to do testing (seismic).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can you explain what same season relief well capabilities are?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dispersants, is that the stuff they used in the Gulf of
                  Mexico? Whose responsibility is it to do the research on
                  dispersants?
                </li>
                <li>
                  For safety you mentioned the Gulf of Mexico. There is a big
                  difference in our area. I have traveled though the area in
                  February by snowmobile. The ice is breaking and there is some
                  water and there is a lot of marine mammals and further up
                  there are more polar bears.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If there was an oil spill similar to the Gulf of Mexico, it
                  would be worse in our area.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another reason is the water current is separating (Baffin
                  Island/Resolute).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Would like to learn more to help each other about potential
                  drilling. If they had a spill here where is the equipment? How
                  long would it take ships to come up here? I would like to see
                  a local resident to go to Inuvik and work with the Board.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I was picked by the federal government to go to the Beaufort
                  Sea to inspect. There was an ice island. The ice was thick and
                  I could walk on it. I remember driving a skidoo from
                  Tuktoyaktuk in winter and they were still drilling. The ice
                  was thick.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In Tuktoyaktuk if there is a spill it could be n one area.
                  &nbsp;In our area there is more current.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We go hunting. You have big baskets to go to the store. We go
                  out hunting sometimes we get nothing. This is how we get our
                  food.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There should be two types of records of the testing - one
                  being photographs so we the local people can understand and
                  see what is happening.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We never worked with these people before in the past. As of
                  today we could work together.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I am from the High Arctic and you came a long distance from
                  Calgary. I have been going on the local radio and telling
                  people at the Hunters and Trappers Organization and Hamlet
                  office. There is no higher of a position than you have. We are
                  not involved as Inuit. Didn't involve us in the testing
                  (seismic). They didn't have Inuit people involved. We are
                  having less say. If I don't see people who should be involved
                  I will be angry again. What can they do with testing? We don't
                  know what they are doing with it. Would like to see very
                  detail and not just on the internet or by email but face to
                  face to let us know these things. We are happy you are here
                  tonight.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We have seals, beluga, narwhals, fish - will they die because
                  of the testing - will they float on top of the water?
                </li>
                <li>
                  I didn't get information of what they are using. Maybe the NEB
                  can see the application and can tell and explain to us what
                  they are using.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't think that we have no ice in the month of July. We
                  always have ice no matter what time of year. Some areas may be
                  slush. As of today we may see no ice. In winter ice is
                  different than in August.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Has the NEB considered excluding some areas around Pond Inlet
                  because of the narwhals?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Scientists have worked on studies for polar bears for many
                  years. Because of skidoos and helicopters and barking of dogs,
                  the polar bears can't hear the seals in the holes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We rely on marine mammals. This is major and will have to be
                  considered. If small animals and fish die, larger ones will
                  die off. We rely on country food - too expensive to buy at the
                  Northern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A lot is going on in our area. What more do they want to do to
                  have us go through more hardship?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Narwhals can stay under water injured for an hour and a
                  bowhead for a half hour. How long will they stick around to
                  see if animals are injured?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't be thinking that there is no representation. There is a
                  representative from the Hunters and Trappers Organization
                  here. As this is spring many are going out on the land. There
                  are a number of hunters and trappers in town. I really want to
                  welcome you to our town.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Those companies (mining and oil) we talk to them of our
                  concerns. Instead of talking to them we should talk to you
                  more. Last year went to Court through the QIA. We had a
                  concern and I wrote a letter and we won the case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We still have a big concern that they like to do testing.

                  Polar bear hunting is in the winter. The ice goes a long
                  distance. There is more water current at the full moon and
                  less current when there is no moon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We can go a long distance when the ice forms as we know where
                  the good areas are for hunting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  With the potential testing we know that area. We would like to
                  share this concern with you again.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some of us know some policies - some are mostly story telling.
                  As we use the wording we see on paper that can benefit us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What I am saying is I like to work with you only if the
                  environment is safe for the two youth here. We need to plan
                  for their futures. As elders we need to keep the environment
                  safe for them.

                  I did drilling before but on land and there was barely any ice
                  and it was not moving at all.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Testing in our area - just using air pressure this cannot go
                  inside the sear floor. Can you explain what it can do or
                  damage? Can you explain more about the equipment?

                  Spring is not the best time to engage communities because of
                  harvesting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even with policies, when inspectors are coming things get
                  cleaned up and then when they leave things go back to the old
                  ways. This was seen in Melville Island.

                  We are concerned for our environment - we don't want to see a

                <li>
                  Greenland has seismic and drilling. Maybe the Canadian
                  government should look to see how they do things.

                  Perhaps 10 - 12 people are working for the company. Most
                  people stay home and there are no benefits. If animals get
                  affected those working for the company are better off. More
                  people are not working for the company than those that are.

                  I have a concern of marine animals. They could go deaf or die.
                  With marine mammals they are moving all the time.

                  When they are testing in the ocean under the water what is the
                  role of DFO? DFO is supposed to protect me. Did they tell you
                  anything?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What is the weighting of other federal authorities versus the

                </li>
                <li>
                  How is the monitoring done on the affects to animals from
                  small animals all the way up?
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the ships are gone who will look for dead fish and seals
                  and deaf seals?

                <li>
                  There was seismic done in the 70's. Guess it wasn't good
                  enough and now they are doing it again. Does it get old and
                  has to be redone?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Still have a concern as in our environment my top priority is
                  to have s safe environment. I traveled from Yellowknife to
                  here and from Iqaluit to here. I know different areas as I
                  have traveled. I want to learn policies when they are applying
                  for licences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I have a concern that they will be searching for gas and oil.
                  Who will search for dead animals?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Two reports could be done and they would be different. The
                  Inuit could do one. As Inuit we know what damaged our animals
                  and if the company is not involving local people that is my
                  concern. Research is happening and we don't know. Need more
                  support from local people. I mentioned to Hunters and Trappers
                  Organization to come and the Hamlet council this meeting. Need
                  at least a local person to do that Report. Can you push that
                  ahead to get local people on board when they are testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can it be a requirement that local marine monitors be used?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Elders have more knowledge. University and younger people
                  don't have the same knowledge. Older people should be
                  observers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If they are getting a licence, if youth are on the ship he can
                  report to elder on what is happening. This would be a better
                  relationship than working against companies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I am thankful you are keeping records of what we are saying.
                  Seems as of today we are not afraid and we can work with each
                  other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I would like you to look into details. A number of local
                  people took training on how to go on the ship. Some of us are
                  trained to do safety boating. We have all this training but
                  still we are not included.
                </li>
                <li>
                  &nbsp;We don't just shot animals and leave them out there. We
                  hunt and eat them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nunavut does not have devolution. Money just goes to the
                  federal government. Right now we don't benefit. Like to see
                  Nunavut government get revenues from oil and mining. Nunavut
                  is short of cash and envious of the Northwest Territories.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If they damage our marine animals we will starve. In Africa
                  they mined for gold and they suffered from hunger and the
                  whole world had to support them and we don't want this.

                  When we re all Canadian citizens, why are there two or three
                  different boards?

                <li>
                  I found out in Yellowknife what your role is. Not everyone
                  knows what your role is.

                <li>
                  Today I have a concern. I took some notes last night. I know
                  you have an office in Calgary and have a number of staff based
                  there. We are in the High Arctic. We can get information from
                  the internet but can you have someone in Pond Inlet or in the
                  High Arctic rather than just in Calgary?
                </li>
                <li>
                  We would clean up when inspectors came and then leave
                  everything when inspectors left.
                </li>
                <li>Need an employee in the High Arctic.</li>
                <li>
                  We don't have shortage or a farm area. We have to go hunt.
                  Sometimes we get nothing and it costs us a lot to hunt. We
                  can't afford to buy food.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can help us a lot but is there any possibility of the NEB
                  having an office in the north? Calgary is a long ways away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are no people watching. If there is an emergency no one
                  could land - we don't have an air terminal. No one could land
                  - we don't have break water. Equipment couldn't get in if
                  there was an incident. If something happens it would be
                  hazardous. Please prepare for our benefit and help us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accidentally someone went overboard and had to be medivaced
                  out. He burned from the salt. What would be done if something
                  happens? We are not from the Beaufort. It is different
                  (current and salt).
                </li>
                <li>
                  I would like to ask a question with the Greenland drilling.
                  They may not know the water current. Can someone tell them not
                  to drill anymore? Last year we saw some small marine mammals
                  that died down and we know the currents and our environment
                  and when the ice cracks we see little plankton. No one has
                  done research on the water current. We know all icebergs came
                  from Greenland. Can someone make a stop order? Whales and
                  narwhals may be no more. Food is dying down. Seals too. Polar
                  bears eat seals. I would like support for a stop order. Polar
                  bears will be extinct. We are Inuit and we hunt for food not
                  sport hunters. We know now they are not prepared at all and if
                  there was an oil spill what would happen to us?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can we plan something else for our community before oil runs
                  out. Never mind the war, can we make energy that is good. I
                  don't like nuclear energy. Can we think of something for the
                  future? Oil will run out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As we are hunters we know when migration goes. Can we plan for
                  more food in the future rather than oil. If our environment is
                  contaminated and the animals die down it could be dangerous
                  and I would like to get support.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thank you for coming to our community to listen to our
                  concerns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I have a concern that the people who came a couple months ago
                  and were asked questions and they mentioned animals won't be
                  scared of noise and they have the best equipment. In the past
                  they used dynamite and did testing in our area and I saw
                  pictures. They mentioned animals won't run away. Animals run
                  away even with small noises. Some could die down or be deaf.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don't like to see drilling happen. We have full darkness/full
                  light and strong winds. If an incident in the winter, if they
                  don't have a plan for clean up how could the ship come through
                  the ice. In the spring the oil could come to our area because
                  of the current. We know the areas where the oil would come in.
                  I know anmals will die.
                </li>
                <li>High Arctic wind is very strong.</li>
                <li>
                  Just like our ancestors, our children and future children will
                  have to hunt to live and animals will have run away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When drilling is happening they use a big amount of sale. Saw
                  seals near the draw. Never used dynamite but sometimes poured
                  salt on the ground by accident. &nbsp;They never mentioned
                  where the salt goes. If they are dumping salt, will see dead
                  animals. Two dead animals were put near seal hole and seal
                  never picked it up. Later found small marine animals died
                  down. &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thinking the equipment mentioned won't scare animals. I know
                  they will. That is the reality. They will scare away animals.
                  Need policies and regulations for potential area for drilling.
                  They are attempting to drill in areas where we said no and
                  where w go hunting. Maybe they don't have any concern at all
                  with the fishing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Did they submit an application and is that why you are here.

                  Down south there are farms. This area is like our farm and
                  very important to us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I do have a concern with when you have all the information,
                  can you send summary to our community that we could use and
                  the same to Clyde River?
                </li>
                <li>
                  For the filing requirements, if seismic happens, this I our
                  farm. Will there be compensation if wildlife is affected or
                  dies off?
                </li>

                  Who will be doing the translation at the Roundtable? There are

                <li>
                  When you talk about experts, are these scientists? We say they
                  are newcomers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Other than drilling, it is not only dangerous as we know. We
                  are different people. We used to get one ship only now there
                  are more for gas and furniture for our homes and military and
                  tourist ships in our area. As hunters we wee them as
                  interfering with the animals already.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One ship got stuck. Exactly the same could happen with
                  drilling. They could have an oil spill. Are you responsible
                  for watching our water? Are you responsible for the tourist
                  ships and military?
                </li>
                <li>We need to know who to talk to if there is an incident.</li>

                  With activities outside of the Nunavut Settlement Area, the
                  Government of Nunavut has nothing to do with resource
                  development. We should wait for devolution to happen before
                  drilling.

                  The price of oil plummeted during Bent Horn. Economics have to
                  be there.
                </li>
                <li>
                  With seismic testing, with all the technology now, why use old
                  methods? When they shot, kills everything within
                  100&nbsp;yards. If using new technologies will there be less
                  impacts?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Very thankful that you came and use me as I am. As when I am a
                  child I used to tell my dad who was not nice to me. Tired of
                  this. We are fully adults. Instead you gave us a presentation
                  and listened to our concerns. We have been dealing with
                  companies for many years. If there are no Inuit, we deny their
                  application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Glad you came into our community. Energy in Inuktitut means
                  something different - it means electricity. Maybe should be
                  National Fossil Board.

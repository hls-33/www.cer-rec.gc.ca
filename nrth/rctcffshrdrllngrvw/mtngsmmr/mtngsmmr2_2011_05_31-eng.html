              </ul>
              <p><strong>Questions and Comments:</strong></p>
              <p>The following questions and comments were posed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  How many wells are there in Nunavut, how many are capped, and
                  how often are they checked?
                </li>
                <li>
                  The difference regarding jurisdiction in the Gulf of St.
                  Lawrence is between river and ocean.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What will happen in the event there is an accident such as the
                  BP blowout?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Not sure the comment regarding whether the Hudson Bay area
                  applies to Nunavut is correct.
                </li>
                <li>How are capped wells checked?</li>
                <li>How would a leak of an abandoned well be discovered?</li>
                <li>
                  What is the reporting process to ensure there are no leakages?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Isn't it like the fox guarding the hen house to have industry
                  monitoring and checking for leaks of abandoned wells? Industry
                  should fund the National Energy Board to do the checking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Epicenter of volcanic activity is offshore of Clyde River (100
                  miles and close to Cairn). There are tectonic plates/tremors.
                  That should be another area of concern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  With respect to Cairn Energy, there are no details being
                  released as to their capabilities to respond to a spill. The
                  Greenlandic communities on the east side of Baffin Bay are
                  equipped with response capabilities but there is nothing on
                  the Baffin Island communities on the west side. Subsistence
                  harvesting is a way of life. Where is the cooperation between
                  the two countries that share a common ecosystem?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Does the National Energy Board have a record or list of
                  naturally occurring oil seeps in the area being discussed?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Through the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum there is about a
                  half dozen documented on the Greenland side but less research
                  on the Canada side. There is some knowledge regarding Scott
                  Inlet that has been known since the&nbsp;1970s.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How does the application of Benefits Plans work outside of the
                  Nunavut Land Claim settlement area and the territorial area?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Understand current vessels and workers are foreign on the west
                  side. If there is to be drilling or seismic activities the
                  assumption is that with risks come benefits. With fisheries,
                  foreign vessels can't fish in Canadian waters. Will it be the
                  same with drilling and seismic?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Benefit Plans are between developers and the Government of
                  Canada. Inuit benefit provisions are for within territorial
                  lands and do not apply to the offshore. How does that work?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Has there been an analysis of what went wrong in the Gulf?
                  Presumably it went through the same type of review as this.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Would Benefit Plans also incorporate resource royalties?
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is vast wealth of resources and fisheries and with the
                  rapid opening of waters Nunavut is not in a good position with
                  respect to royalties due to devolution status. Resource
                  revenues all flow into the general revenues of the Government
                  of Canada.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The way of life of the people of Nunavut and the environment
                  will be impacted. It is not a matter of if, but when. Canada
                  Coast Guard has said they are not ready and people are not
                  trained. The first 24&nbsp;hours of a spill are the most
                  critical.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The North is not prepared. What are the plans in preparing
                  communities if there is a spill?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lessons learned from the Gulf in the U.S. puts the onus on the
                  companies. In Canada there is a $40 million cap and then the
                  rest of the clean up would fall to the public.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Does the area where there is increased financial
                  responsibility only apply in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are there any disputed areas (international) and if so where
                  are they?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What are the plans for meetings with Nunavut communities and
                  Aboriginal groups?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is there a list of the dates and locations of where NEB
                  meetings will be held?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only heard about this meeting in the last few days. This is
                  not sufficient for people to attend with all the other
                  meetings that are going on at the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The traditional knowledge component of what is going on in the
                  Nunavut waters (i.e. migratory routes) is an important factor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Note there are no Aboriginal National Energy Board Members.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Arctic is the last frontier in the world to tap into. More
                  resources should be put to engaging elders and other
                  Aboriginal people for their traditional knowledge and this
                  should be key.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The information Minister Prentice gathered in Greenland was
                  not brought back to communities. There is still a component
                  missing and that is consultation and meaningful dialogue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is a disconnect between the National Energy Board and
                  the people of the last frontier. Those attending the meeting
                  today are mostly workers and not individuals. There is concern
                  about the process and how Nunavut people are being engaged.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Want to hear more about the cooperation that exists between
                  countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Need to put differences aside and get down to protecting the
                  environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What is the scope/mandate with respect to recommendations
                  coming out of this Review and what is the mechanism for
                  implementing recommendations?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Does the Government of Canada have a similar process in place
                  to answer the question of whether or not there should be
                  drilling in the Arctic?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Curious as to why and how the decision was made to have the
                  Roundtable in Inuvik. There should be a Roundtable in Nunavut
                  as well. People think the North is just a big frozen desolate
                  land. This is not the case. The environments are different
                  between the western and eastern Arctic. There are different
                  animals (narwhals, walruses, 4/5ths of the polar bear
                  population), different environments, etc. Nunavut holds the
                  vast majority of the coastline in the Arctic. Nunavut has a
                  benthic based marine environment and not many people have
                  looked under the water to see the animals. This is different
                  than the western Arctic. There are other differences as well -
                  they are different territories, with different land claims and
                  initiatives that are being undertaken as a result of those
                  claims. The Roundtable should be an opportunity to discuss
                  Nunavut specific issues and it would be a missed opportunity
                  for the National Energy Board not to do this. Not convinced
                  there will be another Review that will occur down the road
                  that would look at Nunavut specific issues. Having one
                  Roundtable in Inuvik will end up being a competitive event
                  with both regions trying to put their issues forward.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Iqaluit is not the only community in Nunavut. There are 27
                  other communities and the National Energy Board should be
                  consulting other communities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Report is said to focus on filing requirements but there
                  are bigger questions to be answered for big projects (e.g.
                  cumulative effects) or where there isn't good science (impact
                  and activity of oil under ice) how those gaps will be filled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are different levels of risk and geographic
                  considerations depending on the project. Can it be assumed
                  level of risk is considered at the project stage?
                </li>
                <li>
                  For the big questions where there is no information,
                  individual proponents won't have the information to answer
                  those questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Saying an environmental assessment will be done by technical
                  staff is equivalent to a visually impaired person critiquing a
                  painting. They just don't have the information or knowledge.
                  Much of the information has not been documented. There is
                  traditional knowledge and some people may know that
                  information. An example of how information is being gathered
                  is the Coast Guard throwing bottles with notes overboard ships
                  to see where the bottles end up. This is not reassuring of how
                  studies are being conducted for information that isn't
                  available.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The precautionary principle should be used for industry - if
                  information isn't available and known, the precautionary
                  principle should be used.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nunavut Research Institute has a lot of information available.
                  As it was not known in a scientific context, it is often
                  overlooked but should be taken into consideration. The
                  information is relevant and available.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reality is bigger questions are not being dealt with. If it is
                  known that there needs to be more information about xyz, in an
                  environmental assessment for a specific project, the bigger
                  question remains unresolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even though this Review has a limited scope, at least it is a
                  forum to note that there are gaps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Involving the Nunavut Impact Review Board in projects provides
                  an opportunity for community level input. The challenge though
                  is for municipal governments to meet the requirements - who to
                  hire to put a report together to reflect their community
                  concerns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tapping into the Nunavut Impact Review Board and Nunavut
                  Research Institute for information and knowledge would go a
                  long way.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The fiasco in Lancaster Sound could have been avoided if the
                  Nunavut Research Institute had been involved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Saying the National Energy Board mandate is safety and
                  protecting the environment, when an application comes in, it
                  won't have the information for up here and won't be in a
                  position for a long time. The information is missing. Seems to
                  be putting the cart before the horse. Who are the technical
                  experts that will deal with oil spills in an ice packed
                  environment?
                </li>
                <li>
                  On what basis could a project ever be approved with so much
                  missing information?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Why would the National Energy Board be willing to accept an
                  application if it can't be assessed effectively?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Great that the National Energy Board is here today and is
                  doing this Review to plan for applications and there is a
                  separation between safety and the economics, but once an
                  application comes in, then what? There is still a huge amount
                  of information to be collected in a short period of time
                  (assessing an individual application).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is there a policy that if there is not enough information in a
                  certain area, the National Energy Board can't make a decision?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hopefully as part of the Report recommendations can be
                  included identifying gaps that need to be filled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is the National Energy Board in the general practice of
                  holding public hearings in areas where the project will affect
                  communities? Can oral submissions (traditional knowledge) be
                  made?
                </li>
                <li>
                  What can people expect if the National Energy Board receives
                  an application?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is there a chance of offshore drilling going ahead with just a
                  screening without public scrutiny?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the National Energy Board has been around since 1959 and
                  there was drilling in the 1980s, what has changed? There
                  wasn't consultation in the 1980s.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If something happens outside of the National Energy Board's
                  jurisdiction, it will be here quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How will the National Energy Board validate information
                  submitted?
                </li>
                <li>What process will be used to ensure community input?</li>
                <li>
                  With respect to seismic, industry spoke to communities where
                  the project will occur but it was not clear from the company
                  who did the presentation how input/feedback could be made.
                  This speaks to the issue of self-reporting. The company could
                  put emphasis on one area and not other areas where communities
                  were concerned about.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How information is distributed is a concern and has been
                  brought up before (seismic applications). The current process
                  is that information is on the National Energy Board website
                  but it doesn't get to the communities. Community members are
                  unilingual and need, at a minimum, a summary of the
                  application translated. Regional organization has been doing
                  this but the National Energy Board should make it a
                  requirement of the company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How far from the land mass is the jurisdiction of the National
                  Energy Board beyond the 25&nbsp;km?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Has there been a licence issued for seismic activity in Baffin
                  Bay?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is there coordination with the Nunavut Impact Review Board?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nunavut Impact Review Board should still be involved for
                  projects outside of their jurisdiction because of harvesting
                  rights (marine).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even with cement plugs, who says there won't be leakage into
                  the water? Already there is mercury coming from Asia. People
                  rely on marine life for food.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How would private companies prove infrastructure is in place
                  when much of it is the responsibility of federal departments
                  (Coast Guard, Transport Canada, Fisheries)?
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a Benefits Plan was not approved by a community would the
                  National Energy Board take that into consideration?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How does the National Energy Board ensure a company is held
                  accountable financially in the case of a massive clean up
                  effort? What happens if the company goes bankrupt?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thinking back to the Gulf, the information provided was
                  &quot;cookie cutter&quot; and was not geared to local
                  considerations. Looking here and the challenges with
                  infrastructure, Inuit would not accept this as a lot of the
                  resources would have to come from outside. Would the National
                  Energy Board consider more stringent requirements given the
                  environment?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Has emergency response been tested and, if not, how can it be
                  guaranteed if not tested?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Looking at Greenland, they have a 3&nbsp;tier response (rig,
                  community for smaller incidents and ships and equipment for a
                  larger spill). The third level has government as part of that
                  response. Ultimately this would be looking at financial
                  liability and if it is a huge spill, government would have
                  responsibilities. Inuit would want to know arrangements are in
                  place and not just the company's capabilities and
                  responsibilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Federal departments have very little infrastructure in place
                  to even get up here, never mind to do any type of rescue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Drilling the well is one thing but getting the resource out is
                  another. Is that part of the assessment?
                </li>
                <li>Does Greenland do seismic testing?</li>
                <li>
                  Will the results of the seismic testing now being done be made
                  available to the Canadian government?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Could the National Energy Board have a requirement to have
                  seismic information as a condition to the licence?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is the National Energy Board going to Pond Inlet as part of
                  the Review? Pond Inlet is very concerned with oil and gas and
                  the security of their food sources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where is the National Energy Board drawing its benchmark from
                  globally?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most changes/advancements are made after a disaster and the
                  benchmark is raised higher and higher. It was a different
                  world after the Ocean Ranger incident.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How many barrels of dispersants were used in the Gulf? Fish in
                  this area are bottom fish. Is the use of dispersants ranked or
                  a critical component of a clean up plan?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Usually clean up is scraping oil off the surface of the water
                  or fire. This only cleans up 1/8<sup>th</sup> of the oil. What
                  are the long term effects? Why not take the initiative and not
                  allow it at all?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is this the first time the National Energy Board has held a
                  public meeting in Nunavut. In recent seismic meetings
                  communities felt disconnected with the National Energy Board.
                  Coming to Iqaluit should not be considered as engaging
                  communities nor does a meeting with NTI.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pond Inlet community members are looking at the floods in
                  Manitoba and see the province providing compensation to
                  farmers as that is their livelihood. The marine environment is
                  their livelihood in Pond Inlet and there would need to be
                  compensation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is there a mechanism in place to go out to communities to
                  provide basic knowledge on what seismic is, how drilling
                  occurs and the difference between exploration and production
                  so they are not at a disadvantage in meetings?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nunavut Impact Review Board requires at least a summary of
                  applications to be translated. Will there be a similar
                  requirement for drilling applications? Hopefully the National
                  Energy Board will take this as a flag for moving forward in
                  the future.

                <li>
                  Information coming back from Clyde River (RSP) is that what is

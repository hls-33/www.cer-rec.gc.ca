            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (Act) and the associated
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Geophysical Operations Regulations</em>. The
            Act and the regulations apply to the onshore and offshore areas
            including those in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut and the
            offshore areas of Yukon, British Columbia<sup>[1]</sup>, the Bay of
            Fundy, Hudson Bay, James Bay, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
            Companies that propose to conduct marine seismic activities in these
            areas must apply to the NEB for an authorization pursuant to section
            5(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [1] There are federal and provincial moratoria on oil and gas
            activities in the territorial seas offshore of British Columbia
            since&nbsp;1972 and&nbsp;1989 respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies planning to carry out seismic activities under NEB
            jurisdiction should become familiar with the Statement. The
            mitigative measures contained in the Statement were developed based
            on available scientific knowledge and can be considered to be the
            current best practice for minimizing potential adverse impacts of
            seismic activity that use air source arrays. Applications for
            authorizations to conduct seismic operations and related
            environmental assessment documents should identify the mitigative
            measures that would be applied and a rationale for any that
            represent modifications or variations to those that are set out in
            the Statement.

            Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of
            Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment - Context
          </h2>
          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>
            The
            <em
              >Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of
              Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment</em
            >
            specifies the mitigation requirements that must be met during the
            planning and conduct of marine seismic surveys, in order to minimize
            impacts on life in the oceans. These requirements are set out as
            minimum standards, which will apply in all non-ice covered marine
            waters in Canada. The <em>Statement</em> complements existing
            environmental assessment processes, including those set out in
            settled land claims. The current regulatory system will continue to
            address protection of the health and safety of offshore workers and
            ensure that seismic activities are respectful of interactions with
            other ocean users.

            Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of
            Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment - Background Paper
            -&nbsp;2007
          </h2>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Recent years have seen a heightened interest in the potential
            impacts of seismic surveying on the marine environment.
            In&nbsp;2004, federal and provincial government advisors, and
            national and international scientific experts met to review the body
            of scientific knowledge that exists in this area. A review of the
            most effective and appropriate mitigative measures used world-wide
            was also conducted. These reviews led to the identification of a set
            of mitigation measures, which can assist in minimizing the potential
            adverse impacts of marine seismic activity. Federal and provincial
            governments have compiled these mitigation measures into the
            <em
              >Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of
              Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment</em
            >. The <em>Statement</em> sets out minimum standards which will
            apply in Canada's non-ice covered marine waters to all seismic
            activities that use air source arrays. It will complement the
            existing environmental assessment processes, including those
            pursuant to settled land claims, and the existing regulatory
            requirements that currently govern marine seismic activities.
            Recognizing that the body of scientific knowledge is continually
            expanding, the <em>Statement</em> will be regularly reviewed. As new
            scientific information and improved mitigation technologies and
            practices emerge, these will be considered for incorporation into
            the <em>Statement</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            SOUND IN THE OCEANS is generated by a variety of natural sources,
            including vocalisation by marine life as well as wind and wave
            action, ice movements, and meteorological and oceanographic
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Human activity also contributes to sound in the marine environment.
            Activities such as navigation, dredging, pile driving, ice breaking,
            whale watching and operating fishing gear each produce sound
            patterns with distinct characteristics. Resource exploration and
            production activities, including offshore drilling and marine
            seismic surveying, produce different types of sound. Active sonar
            which is used by security and defence operations produces a distinct
            type of sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are fundamental differences between the type and intensity of
            sound generated by seismic air source arrays and sound associated
            with active sonar. These differences are mainly due to the emission
            of sounds of different intensity, frequency and direction of
            transmission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oceanographic characteristics such as the physiography of the sea
            bottom, the water depth, temperature, salinity and density
            differences can influence the transmission of sound as it travels
            through water. For example, sound levels are quickly reduced in
            shallow waters. In deeper waters, sound is likely to propagate
            further, especially where acoustic channels exist to conduct and
            focus sound energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, considerable international effort has been
            dedicated to a better understanding of the generation and
            transmission of sound in the marine environment and of the potential
            impacts of marine sound on life in the oceans. One area that has
            been of particular interest to the Canadian public is the sound
            associated with conducting marine seismic surveys.
          </p>
          <p>
            SEISMIC SURVEYS use sound waves to gather information about
            geological structures lying beneath the surface of the earth, both
            on land and in the marine environment. A common purpose for
            conducting seismic surveys is to locate rock formations that could
            potentially contain hydrocarbons. Seismic surveys are also conducted
            by government and academic researchers for general scientific
            purposes, to understand the composition, structure and movement of
            the earth's crust.
          </p>
          <p>
            During marine seismic surveys, compressed air is released into the
            water column, creating a sound energy pulse. The pulse is
            &quot;focused&quot; to concentrate the sound energy toward the ocean
            bottom rather than horizontally. These surveys are carried out from
            a ship that tows a sound source or sources, referred to as &quot;air
            source arrays&quot;, and one or more cables (&quot;streamers&quot;)
            that contain sound receivers and other instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sea floor and the structures beneath it are mapped by measuring
            the time it takes for a sound energy pulse to leave the source,
            penetrate the earth, reflect off a subsurface layer, and return to a
            sound receiver. Reflections occur at each layer where there is a
            measurable change in the speed at which sound is transmitted. The
            data retrieved from these surveys provides information on depth,
            position and shape of underground geological formations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most seismic surveys conducted in Canadian marine waters fall into
            the category of two-dimensional (2D) surveys or three-dimensional
            (3D) surveys. The objective of a 2D survey is to provide a broad
            picture of the geological characteristics of an area, including type
            and size of structures present. In conducting a 2D survey, a seismic
            vessel typically tows a single air source array and a single set of
            receivers along a set of parallel and transverse lines, spaced up to
            five kilometres apart, to create a grid pattern. A 3D seismic survey
            is conducted over a smaller area, to obtain more detailed geological
            information and to identify potential targets for hydrocarbon
            drilling. 3D surveys also create a grid pattern, but generally use
            two or more air source arrays and multiple sets of receivers trailed
            closer together.
          </p>
          <p>
            THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SEISMIC SOUND ON MARINE LIFE have been
            studied internationally for decades. Biological impacts on marine
            life from seismic surveys are generally discussed in terms of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>physical impacts, or changes in organisms' physical state;</li>
            <li>
              physiological impacts, or changes in biological functions; and
            </li>
            <li>behavioural impacts, or changes in how organisms act.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2004, governments and academic researchers set out to take
            stock of our scientific knowledge in these areas. The process, which
            was led by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, culminated in a scientific
            peer review process involving national and international scientific
            experts. It considered the most current evidence of physical and
            physiological impacts of seismic sound on marine life, as well as
            potential behavioural impacts, and whether those impacts were
            direct, indirect, chronic or cumulative. The peer review process
            drew a number of conclusions using a risk-based approach that
            considered the likelihood of occurrence, the frequency and duration
            of the impact and the ecological significance or severity of the
            impact.<sup>[2]</sup>

          <p>
            In general, studies have found that for key components of the
            ecosystem, including invertebrates, fish, marine mammals and sea
            turtles, biological impacts vary from species to species and
            according to the proximity to the sound source arrays. Impacts are
            greatest within a few metres of the seismic source arrays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some marine mammals rely heavily on the use of underwater sounds to
            communicate and to echo-locate and emit and can sense different
            sound frequencies. There is evidence that these species hear and
            react to many man-made sounds including those associated with
            seismic surveys. The available data suggests that for a seismic
            sound to result in auditory impairment or other direct physical
            impacts for marine mammals, animals must be located within a short
            distance from the sound source. Most marine mammals, including most
            baleen whales, some odontocetes (toothed whales) and some pinnipeds
            (seals), generally avoid the immediate vicinity of active seismic
            vessels. However, some marine mammals, such as dolphins and
            porpoises, have been observed to swim near sources of seismic sound,
            with no apparent impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The findings of the peer review process concluded that there was
            evidence that at certain received sound levels, behavioural changes
            can be manifested by some marine fish, marine mammals and sea
            turtles. If seismic surveys were to occur in areas and at times when
            a large enough aggregation of these marine organisms were engaged in
            critical biological functions the behavioural impacts might have
            important ecological and population-level impacts. For example the
            impact may be important if it results in the displacement of
            breeding, feeding or nursing marine mammals, dispersion of spawning
            aggregations of fish in their spawning areas and diversion of
            aggregations of marine mammals and fish from their migration routes.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there has recently been an increased interest in sea turtles
            because of the endangered or threatened status of some species,
            relatively little is known about the sensitivity of these species to
            sound. Studies do indicate that sea turtles are able to detect sound
            frequencies similar to those generated during seismic surveys. As a
            measure of precaution, given the limited knowledge on the
            sensitivity of sea turtles to sound and given the endangered status
            of a number of sea turtles, it was concluded that sea turtles should
            have the benefit of the same mitigative measures as marine mammals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on existing scientific information, the peer review process
            concluded that mitigation should be used where detrimental
            population-scale impacts were considered likely to occur, or where
            adverse impacts including death, harm or harassment of individual
            marine mammals or turtles listed as endangered or threatened on
            Schedule&nbsp;1 of the <em>Species at Risk Act</em> were likely to
            occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            The peer review process identified a number of recognized measures
            for mitigating the potential impacts of seismic sound, consistent
            with a precautionary approach. A federal-provincial regulatory
            policy review further identified the most effective measures which
            would be appropriate for use in Canadian marine waters. Federal and
            provincial governments have agreed to incorporate these measures
            into the
            <em

            specifies the mitigation requirements that must be met during the
            planning and conduct of marine seismic surveys, in order to minimize
            impacts on life in the oceans. These requirements are set out as
            minimum standards, which will apply in all non-ice covered marine
            waters in Canada. The <em>Statement</em> complements existing
            environmental assessment processes, including those set out in
            settled land claims. The current regulatory system will continue to
            address protection of the health and safety of offshore workers and
            ensure that seismic activities are respectful of interactions with

          <p>
            The <em>Statement</em> was developed by federal and provincial
            authorities responsible for the regulation and management of seismic
            surveys, including representatives from the provincial governments
            of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia and
            Quebec. Federally, representation included Natural Resources Canada,
            Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
            The <em>Statement</em> was developed following a peer review process
            involving scientific and technical experts, acousticians, and
            experts in the design and effectiveness of mitigative measures.
            Public policy experts as well as experts from the National Energy
            Board, the Canada-Nova Scotia and the Canada-Newfoundland and
            Labrador Offshore Petroleum Boards were also consulted. Public input
            on the <em>Statement</em> was received during a 60-day web-based
            public consultation, and targeted discussions were held with
            representatives from the fishing and oil and gas sectors, academics
            and other interested parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Statement</em> will apply to all seismic activities in the
            marine environment that use air source arrays; as such it will not
            apply to activities conducted in ice covered waters. For seismic
            surveys conducted for the purpose of oil and gas exploration, the
            <em>Statement</em> will be administered by the existing oil and gas
            regulatory bodies - the National Energy Board, the Canada-Nova
            Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, and the Canada-Newfoundland and
            Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board. For seismic surveys conducted for
            any other purposes, the <em>Statement</em> will be administered by
            Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Statement</em> was drafted using the best available
            scientific information, current international best management
            practices and internationally recognized techniques to mitigate the
            impacts of seismic sound in the marine environment. However, it is
            recognized that the body of scientific knowledge is continually
            expanding. As new scientific information and improved mitigation
            technologies and practices emerge, these will be considered for
            incorporation into the <em>Statement</em>. The
            <em>Statement</em> will be reviewed on an annual basis, and
            interested parties will be consulted on any potential amendments.

            <em
              >Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of
              Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment</em
            >
            sets out mitigation requirements for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Planning of seismic surveys;</li>
            <li>Establishment and monitoring of a safety zone;</li>
            <li>
              Prescribed marine mammal observation and detection measures.
            </li>
            <li>Prescribed start-up; and</li>
            <li>Prescribed shut-down.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The following sections briefly describe each of these areas, and the
            requirements contained in the <em>Statement</em>:
          </p>
          <h4>Planning of seismic surveys</h4>
          <p>
            The <em>Statement</em> requires that operators plan and design
            seismic survey programs according to certain conditions. As a
            precautionary measure and to minimize the unnecessary introduction
            of sound into the marine environment, surveys are to be designed to
            use the minimum energy needed to obtain the information sought, to
            reduce or baffle the horizontal spread of sound and reduce the
            generation of unnecessary high frequency sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to further reduce the potential impacts of a seismic
            survey, there is an additional requirement to design programs which
            avoid areas where it is known that there are aggregations of marine
            mammals and marine fish at critical times in their life cycle and
            during critical biological functions such as spawning, breeding,
            feeding, nursing and migration times.
          </p>
          <h4>Establishment and monitoring of a safety zone</h4>
          <p>
            Recognizing that sound is most intense closest to the air source and
            that the potential impacts of seismic are greatest within short
            distances, the <em>Statement</em> requires that a &quot;safety
            zone&quot; be established and monitored around seismic air source
            arrays. As noted above, the propagation of sound and of specific
            frequencies varies according to many factors, including ocean
            depths, temperatures and salinity. This poses a challenge in
            establishing precise distance at which specific sound levels can be
            expected. Similarly, marine species respond differently to various
            frequencies of sound, depending on their biological characteristics,
            life history and their respective hearing thresholds. The use and
            testing of sound propagation models combined with active science
            research programs are increasing our understanding of potential
            impacts and relationships between sound levels/distance and those
            impacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Statement</em> contains a basic requirement for a minimum
            500&nbsp;m safety zone, established around the air source array(s).
            Existing scientific evidence and the application of a precautionary
            approach revealed that beyond a 500m safety zone, sound energy from
            seismic activity is unlikely to cause adverse impacts on marine
            mammals and sea turtles, under many circumstances. However, the
            <em>Statement</em> recognizes that in other circumstances,
            environmental assessment processes may identify the need for a
            safety zone of greater than 500m.
          </p>
          <p>
            As is discussed below, the <em>Statement</em> requires seismic
            vessels to use a qualified marine mammal observer to watch the
            safety zone. If a whale, dolphin, porpoise or sea turtle is seen by
            a marine mammal observer to be within the safety zone, the air
            source array must not be started up until the area is clear.
            Similarly if a marine mammal listed as endangered or threatened in
            Schedule&nbsp;1 of the <em>Species at Risk Act</em> is in the area
            of the safety zone, no activity can begin.
          </p>
          <h4>Prescribed start-up</h4>
          <p>
            Most marine species will likely avoid a seismic vessel while survey
            activities are underway. Seismic operators are required to take
            advantage of this behaviour by using a start up technique whereby
            activation of the air source arrays begins with a pulse from the
            lowest energy source on the array. The remainder of the sound
            sources on the array are gradually activated over a fixed period of
            time. This procedure provides the time and the incentive for marine
            mammals and fish to leave the immediate area.
          </p>
          <p>
            In certain circumstances, such as well site surveys and vertical
            seismic profiling, only one energy source is used. In this
            circumstance, where technically feasible, the start-up procedure
            should consist of a gradual increase of the intensity of the sound
            until it reaches the required intensity.
          </p>
          <h4>Prescribed shut-down</h4>
          <p>
            Once seismic survey activity is ongoing, if a marine mammal or a
            turtle listed as endangered or threatened on Schedule&nbsp;1 of the
            <em>Species at Risk Act</em> enters the safety zone the operator
            must shut down and wait for them to leave. The
            <em>Statement</em> also requires shut down of the array if other
            marine mammals or sea turtles enter the safety zone. These species
            could be those identified by an environmental review process as
            possibly experiencing significantly-adverse population-level impacts
            if exposed to seismic sound.
          </p>
          <h3>Prescribed procedures when active surveying ceases</h3>
          <p>
            As a precautionary measure and to reduce the amount of unnecessary
            sound released into the marine environment, when active surveying
            ceases, operators are required to either shut down the energy source
            completely or shut down all but one source. Continued release of
            sound from a single source would serve to deter whale, dolphin,
            porpoises or turtles from entering the safety zone.
          </p>
          <h3>Prescribed marine mammal observation and detection measures</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Marine mammal observer:</strong>&nbsp; The
            <em>Statement</em> requires the stationing of a qualified marine
            mammal observer on board seismic vessels. The marine mammal observer
            is required to verify that the safety zone is clear for at least
            30&nbsp;minutes before the seismic air source array (s) can be
            activated. A marine mammal observer is required to maintain a
            regular watch during the entire duration of the time that the air
            source arrays are active and that the safety zone is visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use of Cetacean detection technology:</strong>&nbsp; Reduced
            visibility and storm conditions may require the use of different
            mitigative measures, such as Passive Acoustic Monitoring, to detect
            and track the sounds made by vocalizing marine mammals prior to
            start-up. Passive Acoustic Monitoring uses &quot;listening&quot;
            technology to detect animals that are below the sea surface, while
            having no adverse environmental impacts of its own. Passive Acoustic
            Monitoring's usefulness presently is limited to those species that
            are known to vocalize and to spend much time below the water surface
            (e.g., dolphins, sperm whales, northern bottlenose whales).
            Additional approaches to marine mammal detection (including radar,
            infrared detection and adaptation of fishing industry &quot;fish
            finder&quot; technologies) are currently in the research and
            planning stages, and will likely be available in upcoming years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Statement</em> requires the use of cetacean detection
            technology under certain circumstances and conditions. If all of the
            following conditions exist, then PAM, or equivalent technology, must
            be used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the survey's sound sources array has been shut down for more than
              30&nbsp;minutes;
            </li>
            <li>the full extent of the safety zone is not visible;</li>
            <li>
              the survey is in an area where vocalizing cetaceans such as
              dolphins, porpoises and whales listed as endangered or threatened
              in Schedule&nbsp;1 of the <em>Species at Risk Act</em> are likely
              to be encountered, or if the survey is conducted in an area where
              species identified in an environmental assessment process as
              likely to be negatively impacted at a population level by seismic
              sound are likely to be found.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Under these conditions, if the presence of a vocalizing whale,
            porpoise or dolphin is detected and it cannot be identified, the
            operator must assume that it is a whale listed as endangered or
            threatened in Schedule&nbsp;1 of the <em>Species at Risk Act</em>,
            or one identified by an environmental assessment process, and the
            operation must shut down and remain shut down until the operator is
            able to determine that the whale, dolphin or porpoise is outside the
            safety zone, or has not been heard for at least 30&nbsp;minutes.
          </p>
          <h4>Additional or modified mitigative measures</h4>
          <p>
            In some cases, environmental assessment processes will point to
            regional specificities, including oceanographic, geomorphologic and
            biological characteristics, and regulatory reviews may require
            modified or additional mitigative measures to be applied. Also,
            variations to the mitigative measures set out in the
            <em>Statement</em> may be allowed if persons wishing to conduct
            seismic surveys provide an equivalent or greater level of
            environmental protection.

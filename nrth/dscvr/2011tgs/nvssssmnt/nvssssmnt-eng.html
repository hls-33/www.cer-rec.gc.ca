            ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT</p>
          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>TGS NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA and MultiKlient Invest AS (MKI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petroleum GeoServices (PGS), have entered into a joint venture to conduct a two dimensional (2D) seismic survey in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait over five years during the open water season (July-Nov) beginning in&nbsp;2014 (the Project). MKI would be the company that operates the Project if it is approved. MKI has applied to the National Energy Board (Board) for a geophysical operations authorization for the Project under paragraph&nbsp;5(1)(<em>b</em>) of the COGOA.</p>
          <p>MKI’s proposed Project is located seaward of Canada’s 12&nbsp;nautical mile boundary and outside of the Outer Land Fast Ice Zone to the Greenland border. The northern extent of the program is approximately 180&nbsp;km from the mouth of Lancaster Sound, extending south to the 61&nbsp;N&nbsp;parallel. The Project would collect up to approximately 16,173&nbsp;km of 2D seismic data. The Project includes the use of seismic arrays, a support vessel, and associated re-supplying activities.</p>
          <p>When TGS, PGS and MKI filed the preliminary Project description on 8&nbsp;January&nbsp;2011, the Board was required to undertake an environmental assessment (EA) for the Project under the former <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</em> (CEA&nbsp;Act). Following the repeal of the CEA&nbsp;Act and the enactment of the <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em> on 6&nbsp;July&nbsp;2012, the Board continued its EA under the COGOA.</p>
          <p>The Board has considered the information provided by MKI, government authorities, Inuit groups, and the general public in its review of the Project. The analysis in this EA Report is based on evidence on the record for the Project, including the information received from public meetings held in Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit, Nunavut.</p>
          As detailed in this EA Report, various potential adverse environmental effects of the Project were assessed including effects on marine mammals, traditional harvesting, and commercial fishing. The NEB is of the view that, taking into account MKI’s implementation of its proposed commitments, environmental protection procedures and mitigation measures, and through its compliance with the Board’s regulatory requirements and the conditions included in this EA Report, the Project would not be likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.

          <h2 id="s1">1.0 Introduction</h2>
          <p>TGS NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA (TGS) and MultiKlient Invest AS (MKI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petroleum GeoServices (PGS), have entered into a joint venture to conduct a two dimensional (2D) seismic survey in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait over five years during the open water season (July-Nov) beginning in&nbsp;2014 (the Project). MKI would be the company that operates the Project if it is approved. MKI has applied to the National Energy Board (NEB or Board) for a geophysical operations authorization for the Project under paragraph&nbsp;5(1)(<em>b</em>) of the <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA).</p>
          <h3 id="s1_1">1.1. Project Overview</h3>
          <p>The seismic survey would involve a seismic ship travelling back and forth across the area shown in the map below (Map&nbsp;1) towing an array of airguns that produce pulses of sound waves under the water. The sound waves pass through the water and into the rock below the seabed. The reflected sound waves from the rock layers are detected and recorded by listening devices on the streamers called hydrophones, which are also towed by the seismic survey ship. The loudness of the airguns is estimated to be 230&nbsp;decibels at a distance of 1&nbsp;meter away, and will be repeated every 13 to 15&nbsp;seconds, 24&nbsp;hours a day while operating. The Project would collect up to approximately 16,173&nbsp;km of 2D seismic data.</p>
          <p><a href="#s4">Section&nbsp;4.0</a> provides a detailed description of the work associated with the Project.</p>
          <h3 id="s1_2">1.2 Project Purpose</h3>
          <p>MKI has proposed the Project to gain a better understanding of the offshore geology in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait and determine the regional extent of geological formations. MKI believes a high-quality modern regional data set is required to compliment historic data. The results of the survey may be used to inform new exploration activities.</p>
          <h3 id="s1_3">1.3 Baseline Information and Sources</h3>
          <p>The analysis in this Environmental Assessment Report (EA Report) is based on MKI’s Environmental Impact Assessment and responses to information requests as well as letters of comment from various communities and fisheries organizations, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Environment Canada (EC), the Government of Nunavut and oral comments from community members provided during public meetings conducted by the NEB.</p>
          <p>Information filed with the NEB pertaining to the environmental assessment can be found on the NEB website (www.neb-one.gc.ca) by following the <a href="/nrth/dscvr/2011tgs/index-eng.html">North/Offshore Public Registries link</a>. For more details on how to obtain documents, please contact the Chief Conservation Officer (CCO) at the address specified in <a href="#s9">Section&nbsp;9.0</a> of this EA Report.</p>
          <h2 id="s2">2.0 Environmental Assessment Process</h2>
          <p>When TGS, PGS and MKI filed a preliminary Project description on 8&nbsp;January&nbsp;2011, the NEB was required to undertake an environmental assessment (EA) under the <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</em> (CEA&nbsp;Act) because the Project required an authorization under paragraph&nbsp;5(1)(<em>b</em>) of the COGOA.</p>
          <p>The Nunavut Planning Commission determined on 19&nbsp;January&nbsp;2011 that the proposed Project falls outside the boundaries of the North Baffin Regional Land Use Plan and that no conformity review with the approved plan is required; consequently the Project was not forwarded to the Nunavut Impact Review Board for screening.</p>
          <p>On 6&nbsp;July&nbsp;2012, the CEA&nbsp;Act was repealed and the <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</em>, 2012 (CEA&nbsp;Act&nbsp;2012) was enacted. The Project is not captured by the CEA&nbsp;Act&nbsp;2012 or the transitional provisions and an EA under the CEA&nbsp;Act&nbsp;2012 is not required. The Board continues to have a mandate under the COGOA to consider the environmental effects of the Project.</p>
          <h3 id="s2_1">2.1 EA Coordination Process</h3>
          <p>Under the CEA&nbsp;Act the NEB was the Federal Environmental Assessment Coordinator for the Project. On 26&nbsp;January&nbsp;2011, the NEB issued a Federal Coordination Notification (FCN) letter pursuant to section&nbsp;5 of the CEA Act <em>Regulations Respecting the Coordination by Federal Authorities of Environmental Assessment Procedures and Requirements</em> to identify the potential involvement of federal departments in the EA process. EC, DFO and Natural Resources Canada identified themselves as a Federal Authority in possession of specialist or expert information or knowledge necessary to conduct the EA for this Project.</p>
          <p>The FCN letter was also circulated to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the Government of Nunavut, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association (QIA), World Wildlife Fund - Canada, Oceans North, the Canada and Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada for their information.</p>
          <h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Public Participation in the EA Process</h3>
          <p>On 14&nbsp;June&nbsp;2011, the NEB determined that public participation pursuant to subsection&nbsp;18(3) of the CEA&nbsp;Act was appropriate for EA of this Project. After the CEA&nbsp;Act was repealed, MKI partially waived the privilege provided by the <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em> by consenting to the disclosure of materials related to the EA for the Project. This enabled public participation in the Project’s EA process to continue.</p>
          <p>On 23&nbsp;June&nbsp;2011, the NEB withdrew the CCO’s delegation to consider the Project application. The NEB subsequently authorized Board Member David&nbsp;Hamilton to report and make recommendations to the Board on the Project application under section&nbsp;15 of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em>.</p>
          <p>The Board facilitated public participation by maintaining a public registry on the NEB website<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>, releasing a discussion paper for public comment, and holding public meetings in the communities of Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit to collect oral comments on the Project.</p>
          <p>EC, the Government of Nunavut, DFO, the QIA, fisheries associations, and various Inuit communities submitted letters of comment to the NEB regarding the Project. Aboriginal consultation is further discussed in <a href="#s6">Section&nbsp;6.0</a> of this EA Report.</p>
          <h3 id="s2_3">2.3 The NEB’s EA Methodology</h3>
          <p>The Board’s approach to assessing the environmental effects of the Project begins with a description of the Project (<a href="#s4">Section&nbsp;4.0</a>), a description of the setting and the environmental and socio-economic elements within that setting (<a href="#s5">Section&nbsp;5.0</a>), and a summary of environmental and socio-economic concerns raised by the public <a href="#s6">(Section&nbsp;6.0</a>). Based on these, the NEB identified Project-environment interactions expected to occur and any resulting potential adverse environmental effects (<a href="#s7_1">Section&nbsp;7.1</a>). If there were no expected Project-environment interactions, or interactions resulted in positive or neutral effects then no further examination was deemed necessary.</p>
          <p>The NEB then assessed the potential adverse environmental and socio-economic effects, as well as the adequacy of the applicant’s proposed environmental protection strategies and mitigation measures (<a href="#s7_2">Section&nbsp;7.2</a>). Where there were any residual effects remaining after proposed mitigation, cumulative effects were considered (<a href="#s7_3">Section&nbsp;7.3</a>). Conditions of approval related environmental matters are listed in <a href="#s7_4">Section&nbsp;7.4</a>. The NEB’s determination of significance is provided in <a href="#s8">Section&nbsp;8.0</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="s3">3.0 Scope of the EA</h2>
          <p>In initiating the EA under the CEA&nbsp;Act, the NEB considered the factors set out in paragraphs&nbsp;16(1)(<em>a</em>) through (<em>d</em>) of the CEA&nbsp;Act. After the CEA&nbsp;Act was repealed, and given the status of the EA, the Board found it appropriate to retain this scope for the remainder of its EA under COGOA. The scope of the EA includes the Project’s proposed seismic operations and related activities within the Project area, as described in <a href="#s4">Section&nbsp;4.0</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="s3_1">3.1 Future Exploration</h3>
          <p>This EA Report does not assess the effects of future exploration or the potential impacts of offshore drilling. The Board is not aware of any future plans for seismic exploration in this area. Currently there are no active exploration licences in the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait area.</p>
          <h3 id="s3_2">3.2 Strategic or Regional Environmental Assessments</h3>
          <p>A strategic or regional environmental assessment has not been completed for the area in which the Project is proposed. A strategic environmental assessment is an initiative that may be undertaken by AANDC in the future and could be used to assist in making decisions with respect to issuing exploration licences, among other things. The NEB is required to assess applications that are before the Board on a case-by-case basis. The Board’s determination of the Project’s potential for significant environmental impacts under COGOA is independent of possible or pending strategic or regional assessments and planning or management processes, although such information would be considered if it were available and appropriate.</p>

          <h3 id="s4_1">4.1 Location</h3>
          <p>The proposed Project will occur seaward of Canada’s 12&nbsp;nautical mile boundary and outside of the Outer Land Fast Ice Zone to the Greenland border (see Map&nbsp;1 below). The northern extent of the seismic survey is approximately 180&nbsp;km from the mouth of the proposed Lancaster Sound National Marine Conservation Area extending south to the 61&nbsp;N&nbsp;parallel. The majority of the Project will be conducted in deep waters covering an area of approximately 16,173&nbsp;linear kilometres.</p>

          <h3 id="s4_2">4.2 Project Timing</h3>
          <p>The survey is proposed to be conducted in the open water season (from July through to November), depending on weather and ice conditions, for up to 5&nbsp;years starting in&nbsp;2014.</p>
          <h3 id="s4_3">4.3 Project Components</h3>
          <p>The Project is comprised of the activities described in the following table.</p>

                    <li>The airguns would produce sound energy that can be measured in decibels (dB). The peak sound pressure level from the company’s seismic array would be approximately 230&nbsp;dB at a distance of 1&nbsp;m from the array. Sound levels from the arrays would drop rapidly with distance away from the array, and sound energy traveling horizontally away from the arrays would be less than those traveling vertically. The sound generating source will be adapted to reduce received sound levels to 180&nbsp;dB within a 500&nbsp;meter safety radius.</li>

          <h2 id="s5">5.0 Description of the Environment</h2>
          <h3 id="s5_1">5.1 Biophysical Conditions</h3>
          <h4 id="s5_1_1">5.1.1 Marine Environment</h4>
          <p>The Project occurs within the Arctic Climatic Region, which is characterized by mean annual air temperatures below 10&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;Celsuis. Water depths range from 350&nbsp;m to 3,660&nbsp;m in the southern area of the Davis Strait. Sea ice is present in the Project area. Open water periods may start as early as June when openings appear in Baffin Bay. Generally, Baffin Bay and Davis Strait are cleared of all sea ice by mid-August. Freeze-up may start as early as late August in Western Baffin Bay; however, there is considerable inter-annual variability. Wind north of 65 degrees N, has an annual speed of 5-6&nbsp;meters/second that increases south of 65&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;N to 7-8&nbsp;metres/second. The minimum wind speed is reached during mid-summer throughout the region; however, maximum wind speeds can be reached as early as October or November.</p>
          <p>The Davis Strait is over 950&nbsp;km across at its greatest width and at least 300&nbsp;km wide at its most narrow location. Surface water circulation in the Strait is strongly affected by counter-clockwise flowing currents. Sub-marine topography includes an undersea ridge which is the continuation of the mid-Labrador ridge, extending from the coast of Baffin Island to Greenland.</p>
          <h4 id="s5_1_2">5.1.2 Wildlife</h4>
          <p>Wildlife in the Project area includes marine mammals such as bowhead, Beluga, and killer whales; Narwhal; harbour porpoise; polar bears; walrus; and ring, harbour, bearded, hooded and harp seals. Marine birds, fish and marine invertebrates are also present in the Project area.</p>
          <h5><em>Marine Mammals</em></h5>
          <p>The Hudson Bay/Foxe Basin and Davis Strait/Baffin Bay populations of bowhead whales have been identified as &lsquo;Threatened&rsquo; by both the federal <em>Species at Risk Act</em> (SARA) and the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Bowhead whales are often associated with the edge of pack ice and move closer to shore in the summer months. Bowheads migrate large distances throughout the eastern Canadian Arctic from both Foxe Basin and Baffin Bay regions. Bowheads that have been tagged in west Greenland generally moved westward across Davis Strait using leads in the ice in the spring to the Lancaster Sound and northern Baffin Island region in the summer. Migrating bowheads may be encountered in offshore regions, especially in the areas east of Bylot Island. Bowheads using the east coast of Baffin Island in August and September may also be encountered. Habitat modeling indicates at least one area of highly suitable bowhead habitat may exist along the eastern shore of Baffin Island within 30&nbsp;km of shore.</p>
          <p>Narwhal are present throughout the eastern arctic and common in coastal areas. COSEWIC and SARA have identified the population as &quot;Special Concern&quot;p. It is believed most Narwhal overwinter in Baffin Bay, Davis Strait and Hudson Strait. The whales will move up the leads into Pond Inlet and Lancaster Sound when the pack ice breaks up. Studies conducted by DFO indicate Narwhal show a preference for deep fjords and the continental slope along eastern Baffin Island in the summer and fall. Narwhal are typically hunted from May through September. A portion of the Narwhal over-wintering area in Davis Strait is closed to Greenland halibut fishing; the Narwhal don’t typically enter this area until November.</p>
          <p>Beluga whales overwinter in highly productive areas like Baffin Bay, Hudson Strait and Davis Strait. Their summer ranges tend to be in warm shallow bays and estuaries of large rivers. Beluga will migrate south in the fall to overwinter amongst the pack ice, in leads and polynyas where open water provides access to air. It is unlikely Beluga will be encountered in the offshore during the seismic program as they will be in the shallow estuarine areas for the summer. The Cumberland Sound Beluga population has been listed as &quot;Threatened&quot; by SARA and COSEWIC, whereas the Eastern Hudson’s Bay Beluga populations are assigned a status of &quot;Endangered&quot;. Beluga are harvested year-round by community members.</p>
          <p>Killer whales will frequent the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait area in summer and are often seen inshore during the spring and summer. Information regarding their use of offshore habitat is limited. Similarly, there is little information on the Harbour Porpoise. Since they are not commonly found in deep oceanic waters it is unlikely they will be encountered during the seismic program.</p>
          <p>Several pinnipeds including ringed, harp, harbour and hooded seals are found within the study area; the ringed seal being the most common. The Atlantic walrus is hunted in the Nunavut region year round, their habitat preference being shallow near shore areas with high bivalve productivity.</p>
          <p>The Baffin Bay and Davis Strait polar bear populations overlap with the study area. Seasonal distribution of polar bears is largely dependant on the seasonal variation in sea-ice conditions. The main prey of the polar bear is ringed seals. Polar bears within Baffin Bay and Davis Strait typically spend the open-water season on Bylot Island and the shores of Baffin Island; it is therefore unlikely they will be encountered during the seismic program.</p>

          <p>Among marine invertebrates, copepods dominate the zooplankton community in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait with other groups such as chaetognaths, amphipods, gastropods, ctenophores and hydrozoans also being important. The zooplankton planktonic ecosystem in the region is characterized by a brief summer period of intense productivity following the spring phytoplankton bloom.</p>
          <p>Benthic invertebrates occurring in the Project area include: arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms, annelids, terebellid, and polychaetes. The Northern shrimp is the most important commercial invertebrate species within the project area.</p>
          <h3 id="s5_2">5.2 Traditional Land and Resource Use</h3>
          <p>The primary land uses in the Project area are subsistence hunting and fishing. Of particular importance are the harvesting activities related to marine species from coastal communities (including Iqaluit, Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq, Clyde River and Pond Inlet). MKI relied on two major studies published by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board for the purposes of the environmental impact assessment; the Nunavut Wildlife Harvest Study and the Final Report of the Inuit Bowhead Knowledge Study. The studies illustrate that harvesting occurs within coastal areas removed from the offshore area of the proposed Project survey lines. Moreover, the seismic survey will take place entirely in waters no closer than 12 nautical miles from the Canadian coastline.</p>
          <p>MKI has indicated it will not conduct survey work in fjords, inlets or bays, therefore the survey will not occur near harvesting areas. However, concerns have been raised by Inuit communities regarding the potential effect of seismic operations on harvesting activities.</p>
          <h2 id="s6">6.0 Aboriginal Consultation</h2>
          <h3 id="s6_1">6.1 Consultation Conducted by MKI</h3>
          <p>MKI has been discussing the Project with Aboriginal groups since January&nbsp;2011 including meetings with federal and Nunavut departments and agencies, Hunter and Trappers Organizations, and the communities of Clyde River, Pond Inlet, Qikiqtarjuaq, Kimmirut, Pangnirtung and Iqaluit. A summary list of MKI’s consultation activities can be found in <a href="#nnx2">Appendix&nbsp;2</a>.</p>
          <p>On 31&nbsp;May&nbsp;2011, Shari Gearheard filed a petition with the Board from the community of Clyde River opposing the Project. In June&nbsp;2011, QIA, Arctic Fisheries Alliance LP (AFA) and Baffin Fisheries Coalition (BFC) filed letters of comment with the Board indicating a need for further consultation between MKI and stakeholders. In July&nbsp;2011, MKI decided to postpone the Project until the 2012&nbsp;season so that it could invest more time and resources to consult with the Inuit communities and other stakeholders, achieve a better understanding of Inuit traditional knowledge and build personal relationships. MKI subsequently revised the Project commencement date several times.</p>
          <p>NEB Information Request&nbsp;#1 dated 23&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012 asked MKI to respond to the letters of comment received by the Board. In response, MKI addressed questions raised by the QIA, AFA, BFC, and Shari Gearheard and committed to conducting an Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge Study. Furthermore, MKI indicated that it had contracted NEXUS Coastal Resource Management to assist in developing an Aboriginal consultation plan. In May&nbsp;2012, MKI outlined the details of its consultation program in its response to NEB Information Request&nbsp;#2.</p>
          <p>As previously discussed, after the CEA&nbsp;Act was repealed in July&nbsp;2012, MKI enabled public participation in the Project’s EA process to continue by partially waiving the privilege provided under the <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em>.</p>
          <p>Following MKI’s community meetings in June, October, November and December&nbsp;2012, MKI distributed Community Engagement Reports summarizing the meetings, back to the communities they visited and the NEB. In response to comments raised at the June and October meetings MKI circulated a Question and Response Document, as well as a Supplementary Report on marine seismic research and mitigation measures. MKI also translated the Question and Response Document and Supplementary Report into Inuktitut.</p>
          <p>General themes that arose from MKI’s June&nbsp;2012 community meetings included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Concerns regarding the impact of the Project on traditional resources;</li>
            <li>Interest in economic opportunities for each community that could be available from the Project;</li>
            <li>Willingness to collaborate to ensure negative effects are mitigated; and</li>
            <li>The need for more study/public education on the effect of seismic surveys on fish and whales.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Recommendations made by community members during the meetings included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Impact Benefits Agreement with the communities;</li>
            <li>Continuation of consultation and engagement measures;</li>
            <li>Use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring; and</li>
            <li>The undertaking of an Inuit Qaujimatuqangit (IQ) study<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>MKI participated in the public meetings conducted by the NEB in the communities of Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit from 29&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013 to 2&nbsp;May&nbsp;2013. On behalf of MKI, representatives from NEXUS Coastal, PGS and TGS provided a presentation on the Project and answered questions related to the Project when possible. A number of questions related to MKI’s environmental impact assessment were not addressed during the public meetings and MKI committed to following up.</p>
          <p>On 30&nbsp;August&nbsp;2013, MKI filed with the Board responses to outstanding questions from the NEB’s public meetings. MKI assessed the interaction between certain marine mammal species and MKI’s Project and used the results to inform its survey acquisition plan. MKI provided additional details on the role of the MMOs and committed to the installation of Passive Acoustic Monitoring onboard the seismic vessel to listen for cetaceans. Passive Acoustic Monitoring can be used during periods of low visibility to delay ramp-up or initiate a shut down if a vocalizing cetacean is heard. MKI also indicated the MMO final observation reports will be shared with communities. Additionally, MKI and its Community Liaison Officers will work with the BFC and AFA to share the timing and location of the program in an effort to avoid interaction between the respective operations.</p>
          <p>After the public comment period ended, MKI filed a reply with the Board on 8&nbsp;November&nbsp;2013. MKI discussed how it will use IQ in the Project design and how it had accessed all publicly available IQ information about marine mammal movements. MKI indicated that it had applied to the Nunavut Research Institute for a Social Sciences and Traditional Knowledge research permit for an IQ study. MKI will work with the communities closest to the Project, namely Pond Inlet, Clyde River and Qikiqtarjuaq, on the IQ study’s design.</p>
          <p>In MKI’s 8&nbsp;November&nbsp;2013 reply, MKI reiterated its commitment to continue consultation with the communities during the Project and after field operations end. MKI indicated that it will have a Community Liaison Officer in four of the communities (Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit) to facilitate communication between the MKI and the communities throughout the life of the Project. Within its reply, MKI also provided an update regarding the benefits plan required under the COGOA.</p>
          <h3 id="s6_2">6.2 Participation of Aboriginal Groups in the NEB’s Regulatory Process</h3>
          <p>The NEB’s regulatory process was designed to facilitate the participation of Aboriginal groups and to enable them to convey their views on the Project. The NEB determined that public participation in the EA process was appropriate in the circumstances of the Project under subsection&nbsp;18(3) of the CEA&nbsp;Act. Materials related to the EA were posted on the public registry and important NEB documents were translated into Inuktitut. After the CEA&nbsp;Act was repealed, the NEB obtained a partial waiver from MKI to enable public participation in the Project’s EA process to continue.</p>
          <p>On 22&nbsp;March&nbsp;2013, the NEB issued a discussion paper that outlined potential environmental effects, concerns raised, and mitigation measures relevant to the Project. The NEB also conducted public meetings in the communities of Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit from 29&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013 to 2&nbsp;May&nbsp;2013 for the purpose of collecting oral comments on the Project. NEB staff, Board Member David Hamilton, representatives of MKI and interpretors were present at these meetings. Transcripts from the public meetings were posted on the public registry.</p>
          <p>During the NEB’s public meetings, community members sought information regarding the effects of previous seismic programs on marine mammals, the acoustic properties of marine seismic, sound modeling for the Project and the potential effects of the Project on walrus, seals and polar bears. MKI was unable to answer numerous questions from community members.</p>
          <p>On 31&nbsp;May&nbsp;2013, the NEB found that there were deficiencies in the Project application regarding the assessment of socio-economic impacts and Inuit consultation. As a result, the NEB suspended its assessment of the Project application. Additional information was filed by MKI on 30&nbsp;August&nbsp;2013 and the NEB resumed its assessment of the application. The NEB accepted written comments on the Project from the public until 31&nbsp;October&nbsp;2013.</p>
          <p>Aboriginal groups actively participated during the EA process. The NEB received letters of comment from many Inuit communities and organizations including QIA, AFA, BFC, Shari Gearheard on behalf of Clyde River, Pond Inlet community members, Municipality of Clyde River, Mittimatalik Hunters &amp; Trappers Organization of Pond Inlet, and Jennifer Brisksky of Pond Inlet. During the NEB’s public meetings, community members asked questions of MKI and the NEB, and expressed their concerns regarding the Project.</p>
          <p>Issues and concerns raised by Aboriginal peoples throughout the EA process included the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Environmental impacts on marine mammals (including whale migration routes, calving and feeding), fish and invertebrates;</li>
            <li>Effects on traditional and commercial harvesting, including compensation for losses;</li>
            <li>Adequacy of mitigation of potential harm to marine mammals including ramp up times, low visibility procedures and MMOs;</li>
            <li>Need for discussions with communities and use of IQ;</li>
            <li>Employment opportunities, training and benefits including plans for MMOs;</li>
            <li>The use of seismic data, and future exploration plans and the impacts of offshore drilling;</li>
            <li>The absence of a regional environmental assessment or wildlife management planning efforts; and</li>
            <li>The management of waste, wastewater, and ballast water.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="s6_3"><em>6.3 Views of the Board</em></h3>
          <p>The Board finds that MKI has made sufficient efforts to consult with potentially-impacted Aboriginal groups and to address concerns raised. MKI postponed the Project commencement date to invest more time and resources to consult with the Inuit communities. MKI subsequently enhanced its consultation program. MKI provided potentially-impacted Aboriginal groups with adequate information about the Project and gave them the opportunities opportunity to make their views known in a timely manner to MKI and the Board. MKI conducted several community engagement meetings and returned to some communities multiple times. In addition to in-person meetings, details about the Project were provided to Aboriginal groups through Community Engagement Reports, Question and Response Document, Supplementary Report, and EA materials posted on the public registry. MKI translated some of these documents into Inuktitut.</p>
          <p>The Board also finds that Aboriginal groups had an adequate opportunity to participate in the NEB’s EA process. Aboriginal groups filed letters of comment with the Board, and both QIA and AFA were granted extensions to filing deadlines. Aboriginal groups also had the opportunity to ask questions and bring forward concerns during the NEB’s public meetings held in potentially-affected communities. Furthermore, transcripts of these public meetings were accessible on the public registry.</p>
          <p>The Board notes that MKI has implemented actions and made commitments as a result of its consultation with Aboriginal groups. For example, MKI has:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>contracted NEXUS Coastal Resource Management to assist in developing an Aboriginal consultation plan;</li>
            <li>committed to employing two Inuit Observers, one on the seismic vessel and the other on the support vessel;</li>
            <li>committed to the installation of Passive Acoustic Monitoring onboard the seismic vessel to listen for marine mammals;</li>
            <li>committed to conduct an Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge Study (IQ) study, and to work with Inuit communities on the design of the study;</li>
            <li>prepared a survey acquisition plan based on an interaction assessment of MKI’s Project  and certain marine mammal species;</li>
            <li>committed to continuing consultation with Inuit communities throughout the duration of the Project as well as after the conclusion of field operations;</li>
            <li>committed to hiring Community Liaison Officers in four of the communities (Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit) to facilitate communication between MKI and the communities;</li>
            <li>committed to the sharing of  a final observation report with Inuit communities; and</li>
            <li>committed to working with the BFC and AFA to share the timing and location of the program in an effort to avoid interaction between the respective operations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Concerns regarding potential environmental effects from the Project on traditional resource use have been addressed by the mitigation measures developed by MKI and detailed in <a href="#s7_2">section&nbsp;7.2</a> of this EA Report. The Board also recognizes that some concerns raised by Aboriginal groups are beyond the scope of the Project and this EA.</p>
          <p>The Board is of the view that MKI meaningfully engaged with Aboriginal groups in respect of the Project to an extent that is commensurate with the scope of the Project. The Board expects MKI to continue its consultation activities with Aboriginal groups throughout the lifecycle of the Project. Conditions outlined in <a href="#s7_4">Section&nbsp;7.4</a> will require MKI to incorporate available IQ into the Project design, provide MMO reports and status updates of environmental commitments to Inuit communities, and conduct Project update meetings.</p>

          <h4 id="s7_2_1"><em>Views of the Board</em></h4>
          <p>The potential for adverse effects to marine mammals, traditional harvesting of marine mammals and fish, and commercial fish harvesting are identified by the NEB as the main concerns associated with the Project. The NEB has carefully considered all potential adverse effects and the proposed mitigation noted above in determining the potential for the Project to result in significant adverse effects.</p>
          <p>The Board recognizes that no individual mitigation measure would be able to completely eliminate adverse effects to marine mammals, nor would any individual measure be infallible. However, collectively, the mitigation measures above would minimize the possibility of marine mammals occurring in close enough proximity to the airgun discharges such that they would suffer permanent or temporary hearing damage or behavioural changes. The NEB finds that the Project’s residual effects would likely be of short-term duration, in which individual receptors such as marine mammals would be exposed to effects during the seasonal survey, but the effects would be reversible during the life of the Project. The effects would occur at a local to regional scale and would be of low magnitude.</p>
          <p>Additionally, DFO concluded in its letter dated 10&nbsp;June&nbsp;2011 that the Project is not likely to result in impacts to fish and fish habitat.</p>
          <p>The NEB is of the view that for this Project, if MKI follows the above-mentioned mitigation measures, the commitments made within its application and additional submissions to the NEB, and adheres to the NEB’s conditions presented in <a href="#s7_4">Section&nbsp;7.4</a>, the Project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.</p>
          <h3 id="s7_3">7.3 Cumulative Effects Assessment</h3>
          <p>The assessment of cumulative effects entails the consideration of projects and activities that have been or will likely be carried out that have or would have residual effects that may act in a cumulative manner with the residual effects of the proposed Project on the environment. A residual effect is an environmental effect that remains, or is predicted to remain, even after mitigation measures have been applied.</p>
          <h4><em>Identification of Residual Effects from the Project</em></h4>
          <p>Potential adverse effects from the Project are identified in <a href="#s7_1">Section&nbsp;7.1</a> and mitigation measures for each were noted in <a href="#s7_2">Section&nbsp;7.2</a> of this report. Those effects that were considered highly localized or negligible in magnitude were not considered in this assessment of cumulative effects, as it was determined they would not have potential to interact with residual effects of other projects in any measurable manner. In consideration of MKI’s planned mitigation measures, the Board identified the following residual effects from the Project that have potential to interact cumulatively:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>temporary displacement of marine mammals due to exposure to anthropogenic sound input and vessel traffic; and,</li>
            <li>temporary displacement of fish due to exposure to anthropogenic sound input and vessel traffic.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><em>Identification of Other Projects and Activities</em></h4>
          <p>Other activities that would be likely to be carried out in the Project area over the same time period as the Project include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>commercial fishing;</li>
            <li>commercial shipping (domestic and international); and</li>
            <li>scientific research surveys (which gather data on marine ecosystems, geology, climate, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Board has not identified any other likely future seismic projects in the area.</p>
          <h4><em>Identification and Mitigation of Potential Cumulative Effects</em></h4>
          <p>Additional boat traffic resulting from the activities listed above has the potential to contribute cumulatively to the disturbance to marine mammals and fish. If more than one vessel is operating in the same area at any one time, some localized avoidance behavior by whales might be expected.</p>
          <p>Mitigation measures to reduce the exposure of marine mammals and fish to simultaneous and overlapping noise sources include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MKI will send a daily email to AFA and BFC.</li>
            <li>A Fisheries Liaison Officer will maintain daily communication with the fishing fleets in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait.</li>
            <li>MKI will post notices to mariners indicating where and when surveying will occur.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The above measures will inform vessels of their proximity to each other and provide an opportunity to maintain an appropriate distance.</p>
          <h4>Cumulative Effects Significance Determination</h4>
          <p>The NEB finds that any potential cumulative environmental effects would be minimal due to the mitigation measures that would reduce exposure of marine mammals to simultaneous and overlapping noise sources. The NEB notes that displacement of marine mammals and fish would be temporary, and reversible. The distance between MKI’s seismic vessel and other vessels in the Project area would decrease the potential for cumulative effects to occur.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the NEB has determined that it is not likely that there would be any significant cumulative environmental effects resulting from this Project.</p>
          <h4 id="s7_4">7.4 Conditions</h4>
          <p>The following environmental conditions will be included in any authorization that the NEB grants:</p>

		  <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Airgun:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">An airgun is a specialized sound source that creates underwater sound by releasing a burst of compressed air into the water at great speed. During seismic operations airguns are towed in arrays of several airguns. The airguns are fired simultaneously to generate enough sound for geophysical measurements.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Ballast Water:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">Refers to water held in tanks on ships to increase stability and maneuverability of the ship during transit. Ballast water may be taken on or released depending on the amount or weight of the ship’s cargo or during changing sea conditions.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Bilge water:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">This is water that collects in the lowest point of a ships hull. Most bilge systems are designed to keep the decks clear of accumulated water during wet weather.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Decibel (dB):</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">A decibel is used to quantify sound levels and is a logarithmic scale rather than a linear scale. The human and marine mammal sense of hearing is also logarithmic so decibels are used for sound measurement. For example 0-20&nbsp;dB is very faint and 90-100&nbsp;dB is very loud.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Gravity Meter:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">A device that measures changes in the local gravitational field of the earth. Changes in the gravitational field may be caused by geologic structures.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Hydrophone:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">A device used to record underwater sound including seismic data.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Masking:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">When a sound is masked it is not possible to hear it because another louder sound is covering up the particular sound. For example, it is difficult to hear someone talking when you are on a snowmobile because the engine noise masks the speaker’s voice.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>National Marine Conservation Area:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">Marine areas managed for sustainable use and containing zones of high protection. They include the seabed, the water above it and any species which occur there. They may also take in wetlands, estuaries, islands and other coastal areas. They are designated by Parks Canada.</div>
          <div class="col-md-4 "><strong>Outer Land Fast Ice Zone:</strong></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 ">Defined by the <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em> as the area bounded by:<ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
              <li>in the north by Latitude 73E 40' off Cape Liverpool on Bylot Island,</li>

          <h2 id="nnx3">Appendix&nbsp;3: Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment</h2>
          <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
          <p>The Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment specifies the mitigation requirements that must be met during the planning and conduct of marine seismic surveys, in order to minimize impacts on life in the oceans. These requirements are set out as minimum standards, which will apply in all non-ice covered marine waters in Canada. The Statement complements existing environmental assessment processes, including those set out in settled land claims. The current regulatory system will continue to address protection of the health and safety of offshore workers and ensure that seismic activities are respectful of interactions with other ocean users.</p>
          <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Cetacean:</strong> means a whale, dolphin or porpoise.</p>
          <p><strong>Critical habitat:</strong> means the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species' critical habitat in the recovery strategy or in an action plan for the species.</p>
          <p><strong>Marine Mammal Observer:</strong> means an individual trained to identity different species of marine mammals and turtles that may reasonably be expected to be present in the area where the seismic survey will take place.</p>
          <p><strong>Marine mammals:</strong> means all cetaceans and pinnipeds.</p>
          <p><strong>Passive Acoustic Monitoring:</strong> means a technology that may be used to detect the subsea presence of vocalizing cetaceans.</p>
          <p><strong>Pinniped:</strong> means a seal, sea lion or walrus.</p>
          <p><strong>Ramp-up:</strong> means the gradual increase in emitted sound levels from a seismic air source array by systematically turning on the full complement of an array’s air sources over a period of time.</p>
          <p><strong>Seismic air source:</strong> means an air source that is used to generate acoustic waves in a seismic survey.</p>
          <p><strong>Seismic air source array(s):</strong> means one or a series of devices designed to release compressed air into the water column in order to create an acoustical energy pulse to penetrate the seafloor.</p>
          <p><strong>Seismic survey:</strong> means a geophysical operation that uses a seismic air source to generate acoustic waves that propagate through the earth, are reflected from or refracted along subsurface layers of the earth, and are subsequently recorded.</p>
          <p><strong>&quot;Statement&quot;:</strong> means the Statement of Canadian Practice for the Mitigation of Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment.</p>
          <p><strong>Whale:</strong> means a cetacean that is not a dolphin or porpoise.</p>

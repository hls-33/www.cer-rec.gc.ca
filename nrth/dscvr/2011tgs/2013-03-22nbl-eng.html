            TGS, PGS and MKI propose to conduct an offshore marine seismic
            survey in Baffin Bay/Davis Strait. The proposed Project is expected
            to be carried out over five years during the open water season
            beginning in 2013. TGS, PGS and MKI have applied to the National
            Energy Board (NEB) for a geophysical operations authorization (GOA)
            for the Project under the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operation Act </em>(COGOA).
          </p>
          <p>
            This letter updates the process information dated
            13&nbsp;July&nbsp;2011 and 11&nbsp;October&nbsp;2011. In these past
            letters, the NEB committed to provide a draft environmental
            screening report for public comment under the <em>Canadia</em
            ><em>n Environmental Assessment Act</em>. That act has since been
            repealed however and replaced with the
            <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 </em>(CEA Act 2012).
            Although the Project is not subject to the CEA Act 2012, the NEB is
            continuing its environmental assessment of the Project under the
            COGOA and is releasing a discussion paper. The discussion paper is
            appended and provides information regarding the Project and will
            guide discussions at community meetings where oral comments will be
            heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            The public meetings will be held from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;pm in the
            following communities:

          <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>
            PGS and TGS want to conduct a seismic survey in Baffin Bay and Davis
            Strait each open water season (July-Nov) for up to five years
            beginning in 2013 (the Project). MKI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
            PGS and would be the company that operates the Project if it is
            approved. TGS, PGS and MKI have applied to the National Energy Board
            (NEB) for a geophysical operations authorization (GOA) for the
            Project under the <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operation Act</em> (COGOA).
          </p>
          <p>
            This paper provides information regarding the Project to facilitate
            public comments on it. Interested parties are invited to submit
            written comments to the Board and/or provide oral comments at
            community meetings. Written comments must be submitted by

          <h2>2. PROJECT BACKGROUND</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Project Description</h3>
          <p>
            As shown in the diagram below (Figure&nbsp;1), the survey would
            involve a seismic survey ship travelling back and forth across the
            area shown in the map below (Map 1) towing an array of airguns that
            produce pulses of sound waves under the water. The sound waves pass
            through the water and into the rock below the seabed. The reflected
            sound waves from the rock layers are detected and recorded by
            listening devices on the streamers called hydrophones, which are
            also towed by the seismic survey ship. The loudness of the airguns
            is estimated to be 230&nbsp;decibels at a distance of 1&nbsp;meter
            away, and will be repeated every 13 to 15&nbsp;seconds, 24 hours a
            day while operating. See <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a> for
            further details.

          </p>
          <h3>2.2 Location</h3>
          <p>
            The proposed Project will occur seaward of Canada&rsquo;s
            12&nbsp;nautical mile boundary and outside of the Land Fast Ice Zone
            to the Greenland border (See Map&nbsp;1 below). The northern extent
            of the seismic survey is approximately 180&nbsp;km from the mouth of
            the proposed Lancaster Sound National Marine Conservation Area
            extending south to the 60&nbsp;N parallel. The majority of the
            Project will be conducted in deep waters (ranging from 360&nbsp;m to
            3,660&nbsp;m), covering an area of approximately 16,173&nbsp;linear
            kilometres.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Nunavut Planning Commission determined on
            19&nbsp;January&nbsp;2011 that the proposed Project falls outside
            the boundaries of the North Baffin Regional Land Use Plan and that
            no conformity review with the approved plan is required;
            consequently the Project was not forwarded to the Nunavut Impact
            Review Board for screening.

          <h3>2.3 Project Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            The company has proposed the Project to gain a better understanding
            of the offshore geology in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait and determine
            the regional extent of geological formations. The company believes a
            high-quality modern regional data set is required to compliment
            historic data. The results of the survey may be used to inform new
            exploration activities.
          </p>
          <h2>3. COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC</h2>
          <p>
            The company has been discussing the Project with the communities of
            Iqaluit, Clyde River, Pond Inlet, Qikiqtarjuaq, Pangnirtung, and
            Kimmirut from January&nbsp;2011 to the present day. The NEB received
            letters of comment from the following organizations: the Qikiqtani
            Inuit Association, Environment Canada, the Arctic Fisheries
            Alliance, the Baffin Fisheries Coalition, Fisheries and Oceans
            Canada and the Government of Nunavut.  Letters were also received
            from Shari Gearheard on behalf of Clyde River residents. Issues and
            concerns raised related to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Environmental impacts on marine mammals (including whale migration
              routes, calving and feeding), fish and invertebrates;
            </li>
            <li>
              Effects on traditional and commercial harvesting, including
              compensation for losses;
            </li>
            <li>
              Adequacy of mitigation of potential harm to marine mammals
              including ramp up times, low visibility procedures and Marine
              Mammal Observers (MMO);
            </li>
            <li>
              Need for discussions with communities and use of Inuit
              Qaujimajatuqangit (Inuit traditional knowledge);
            </li>
            <li>
              Employment opportunities, training and benefits including plans
              for MMOs;
            </li>
            <li>
              The use of seismic data, and future exploration plans and the
              impacts of offshore drilling;
            </li>
            <li>
              The absence of a regional environmental assessment or wildlife
              management planning efforts; and
            </li>
            <li>The management of waste, wastewater, and ballast water.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB will take these issues into consideration in its
            environmental assessment and decision-making, to the extent that
            they are relevant to the Project and within the NEB&rsquo;s
            regulatory mandate under COGOA.
          </p>
          <h2>4. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB is conducting an environmental assessment as part of its
            assessment of the GOA application for the Project. A number of
            potential environmental effects from the Project have been
            identified.
          </p>
          <h3>4.1 Effects of Seismic Operations on Marine Mammals</h3>
          <p>
            The noise generated by the air guns during seismic operations has
            the potential to result in the following effects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Long term and short term hearing damage;</li>
            <li>
              Masking of communication as a result of overlapping sound of the
              air guns and whale calls; and
            </li>
            <li>Changes in behavior or movement patterns such as avoidance.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            4.2 Other Potential Environmental Effects of Seismic Operations
          </h3>

            <li>Changes in commercial and traditional harvesting.</li>
            <li>Disturbance to birds and/or attraction to onboard lights.</li>
            <li>
              Disturbance to, damage, and or mortality of marine invertebrates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decrease in local air and water quality due to ineffective
              management of ship board waste, ballast and bilge water and
              spills.
            </li>
            <li>
              Damage to water quality and wildlife due to accidents and
              malfunctions such as spills.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Under section&nbsp;15 of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em>, the
            NEB authorized Board Member David Hamilton to report and make
            recommendations to the NEB about the Project application. Written
            comments from the public and information gathered from community
            meetings will inform Mr.&nbsp;Hamilton&rsquo;s report and
            recommendations to the NEB. The NEB will then decide whether to
            approve or deny the Project application.

          <h2>7. Glossary of Terms</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Airgun</strong>: An airgun is a specialized sound source
            that creates underwater sound by releasing a burst of compressed air
            into the water at great speed. During seismic operations airguns are
            towed in arrays of several airguns. The airguns are fired
            simultaneously to generate enough sound for geophysical
            measurements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ballast Water</strong>: Refers to water held in tanks on
            ships to increase stability and maneuverability of the ship during
            transit. Ballast water may be taken on or released depending on the
            amount or weight of the ship&rsquo;s cargo or during changing sea
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bilge water: </strong>This is water that collects in the
            lowest point of a ships hull. Most bilge systems are designed to
            keep the decks clear of accumulated water during wet weather.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Decibel (dB</strong>): A decibel is used to quantify sound
            levels and is a logarithmic scale rather than a linear scale. The
            human and marine mammal sense of hearing is also logarithmic so
            decibels are used for sound measurement. For example 0-20 dB is very
            faint and 90-100&nbsp;dB is very loud.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gravity Meter</strong>: A device that measures changes in
            the local gravitational field of the earth. Changes in the
            gravitational field may be caused by geologic structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hydrophone</strong>: A device used to record underwater
            sound including seismic data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Masking: </strong>When a sound is masked it is not possible
            to hear it because another louder sound is covering up the
            particular sound. For example, it is difficult to hear someone
            talking when you are on a snowmobile because the engine noise masks
            the speaker&rsquo;s voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>National Marine Conservation Area</strong>: Marine areas
            managed for sustainable use and containing zones of high protection.
            They include the seabed, the water above it and any species which
            occur there. They may also take in wetlands, estuaries, islands and
            other coastal areas. They are designated by Parks Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Streamer: </strong>Solid cables that are towed 5-10&nbsp;m
            below the surface of the water and contain the hydrophones.

                    <li>
                      A source (airgun) array, containing up to 34&nbsp;active
                      airguns in total (in three sub-arrays) would be towed
                      behind a seismic vessel to generate sound energy.

                    <li>
                      The airgun array has a total volume of 4135&nbsp;in&sup3;
                      and would discharge alternately every 13 to 15 seconds,
                      and would operate 24&nbsp;hrs per day.

                    <li>
                      The airguns would produce sound energy that can be
                      measured in decibels (dB). The peak sound pressure level
                      from the company&rsquo;s seismic array would be
                      approximately 230&nbsp;dB at a distance of 1 m from the
                      array. Sound levels from the arrays would drop rapidly
                      with distance away from the array, and sound energy
                      traveling horizontally away from the arrays would be less
                      than those traveling vertically. The sound generating
                      source will be adapted to reduce received sound levels to
                      180&nbsp;dB within a 500&nbsp;meter safety radius.

          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            The Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of
            Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment specifies the mitigation
            requirements that must be met during the planning and conduct of
            marine seismic surveys, in order to minimize impacts on life in the
            oceans. These requirements are set out as minimum standards, which
            will apply in all non-ice covered marine waters in Canada. The
            Statement complements existing environmental assessment processes,
            including those set out in settled land claims. The current
            regulatory system will continue to address protection of the health
            and safety of offshore workers and ensure that seismic activities
            are respectful of interactions with other ocean users.

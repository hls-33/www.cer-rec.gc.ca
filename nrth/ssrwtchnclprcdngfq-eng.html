            Same Season Relief Well (SSRW) Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            After carefully considering the information submitted, the Board has
            decided to grant the two requests for review. The Board determined
            it would be beneficial, early in the regulatory review process, to
            establish whether the proposals would meet the intended outcome of
            the SSRW Policy, as it is a major element of both projects. There
            will be an opportunity for public participation in the review
            processes.

              the Board to consider and provide a ruling on their respective

            <li>
              Through the Review of Offshore Drilling in the Canadian Arctic
              (Arctic Review), the Board re-affirmed its SSRW Policy: the
              applicant must demonstrate, in its Contingency Plan, the
              capability to drill a relief well to kill an out-of-control well
              during the same drilling season. This is referred to as same
              season relief well capability.
            </li>
            <li>
              The NEB also requires that the Contingency Plan take into account
              anticipated hazards and risks, and identify the appropriate
              equipment, procedures, and personnel for mitigating these hazards
              and risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              A relief well is one contingency measure used to respond to an
              out-of-control well. In addition, we will continue to require an
              operator to use all intervention techniques available, in addition
              to a relief well, so that the flow from an out-of-control well can
              be stopped as quickly as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Board stated that it will continue to require that any company
              applying for an offshore drilling authorization provides us with
              specific details as to how they will either meet this policy, or
              meet or exceed the intent of the policy. The intent of the Policy
              is to minimize harmful impacts on the environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Detailed contingency planning and commitments for relief wells
              remain a regulatory requirement for all offshore drilling in
              Canadian waters.

              The Board determined it would be beneficial, early in the

              would meet the intended outcome of the SSRW Policy, as it is a
              major element of both projects.

            <li>
              On 11&nbsp;May&nbsp;2010, the NEB initiated a review of the safety
              and environmental requirements for offshore drilling in Canada’s
              unique Arctic environment to examine the best information
              available on the hazards, risks and safety measures associated
              with offshore drilling in the Canadian Arctic.

              Through the Arctic Review, the Board developed Filing Requirements
              for Offshore Drilling in the Canadian Arctic which outlines what
              we expect to see from a company in their application. One of the
              key issues addressed during the review was the NEB’s SSRW Policy.

          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              The Board undertook an analysis of worldwide drilling practices
              and lessons learned as part of the Arctic Review. One of the
              issues to be considered in the proceeding is “Implications of the
              Board accepting a departure from the SSRW Policy.”

              The Board stated that it is open to considering evolving and
              changing technologies. However, it has made no determinations
              about what tools or technologies would meet the intended outcome
              of the SSRW Policy. One of the issues to be considered in the
              proceeding is “How the tools and techniques proposed would meet
              the criteria and address the risks in the circumstances of a worst
              case scenario.”

          <ul class="lst-spcd">

              We have staff with the offshore expertise and experience necessary
              to assess, inspect, and conduct audits of offshore drilling
              projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our expert staff includes geophysicists, geologists, drilling
              engineers, safety engineers, offshore structures engineers, safety
              inspectors, environmental specialists, and marine emergency
              response experts.

              >20. What potential impacts on the North will the NEB consider
              when deciding whether to approve offshore drilling in the
              Arctic?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              Drilling cannot occur in the Arctic unless the NEB is satisfied
              that drilling plans are safe for workers and the public and that
              they will protect the environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any ruling at the conclusion of the SSRW technical proceeding will
              only address whether the intent of the SSRW Policy has been met or
              exceeded, not whether the Project would be authorized to proceed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Proponents wishing to drill in the Arctic will still need to apply
              for an Operations Authorization, and demonstrate that they can
              respond effectively if an incident were to occur. As well, they
              must provide proof of financial responsibility to control,
              clean-up, and compensate the people of the North in the event of a
              spill.

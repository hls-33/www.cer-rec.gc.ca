              <p>
                The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) is Canada’s energy and safety
                regulator. We take all reports of non-compliance seriously, and
                will take enforcement action if we discover that our regulatory
                requirements are not being followed. Examples of non-compliance
                could include: violations of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act
                (CER Act) and regulations involving the safety of pipelines and
                facilities, pipeline integrity, environmental protection,
                emergency management and security, or damage prevention.

                Our Confidential Disclosure (Whistleblower) Process Guide is
                based on internationally-recognized best practices, and
                formalizes the way we receive, track, and handle confidential
                disclosures regarding CER-regulated pipelines and facilities.
              </p>
              <p>The purpose of this guide is to provide the public with:</p>

              <p>
                The Confidential Disclosure (Whistleblower) Process Guide
                provides the CER with a formalized way to receive, track and
                handle confidential disclosures related to CER regulated
                pipelines and facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CER has long encouraged the reporting of non-compliances
                associated with its regulated companies, and are committed to
                providing a safe, easy and anonymous way for the public to
                report information. Effective 3&nbsp;April 2017, we have
                <a href="https://www.clearviewconnects.com/home" rel="external"

                (ClearView), a confidential reporting service that will accept
                anonymous disclosures on the CER’s behalf. All information
                reported will be collected, stored, and managed in a secure
                manner. Information that could reveal the identity of a tipster
                will be isolated from other CER databases.

              <h3 id="s2_1">Blowing the Whistle: Your Role as the Tipster</h3>
              <p>
                The CER defines “tipster” as the person who reports an alleged
                act of non-compliance. All information can be submitted using
                <a href="https://www.clearviewconnects.com/home" rel="external"
                  >ClearView's reporting system</a
                >
                and tipsters may submit their report in the format of their
                choosing (as outlined above).
              </p>
              <p>
                The tipster may wish to provide documents, images, photos or
                other relevant information to the CER. The decision to provide
                such materials rests solely with the tipster. The tipster’s role
                is complete once they have submitted their report. They will not
                be required to conduct, review, consider, or otherwise review an
                investigative step or any other activity. It will then up to the
                CER to decide the next course(s) of action.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is no compensation in exchange for submitting information.
              </p>
              <p>
                For more guidance on what types of information to include in
                your disclosure see section below on
                <a href="#s3_1"

                >
              </p>
              <h3 id="s2_2">Enhancing Confidentiality</h3>
              <p>
                We acknowledge that being a tipster can be difficult and
                stressful. This is why we do our best to ensure the
                confidentiality of those who report alleged non-compliances. All
                confidential disclosures are initially received by ClearView
                Connects. This provides tipsters with a secure and reliable
                channel to report alleged non-compliances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to submitting any information, you will be required to
                make a written declaration indicating that you would either like
                to remain anonymous or that you are waiving your claim to
                anonymity. If you choose to remain anonymous, the CER’s prices
                is structured so as to maximize confidentiality and security. To
                maintain the integrity of this process, we use the following
                procedures:
              </p>
              <ol class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  Only trained CER staff who are members of the Disclosure
                  Evaluation Committee are permitted to review disclosures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All written disclosures, information regarding the tipster’s
                  identity, correspondence to and from the tipster, and other
                  documents that could reveal the tipster’s identity will be
                  physically and electronically collected, stored, and managed
                  securely. Information that could reveal the identity of a
                  tipster will be isolated from other CER databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All physical and digital (electronic) documents are marked as
                  protected documents.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                It is important to note, however, that in certain instances the
                CER may be required by law to provide information that could
                identify a tipster. While we do our best to maintain your
                privacy, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. You will
                be advised in advance if there is a lawful release of
                information that could identify you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Decisions regarding CER compliance verification activities,
                courses of action, and dispositions rest with the CER alone.

                Confidential Disclosure Model: What Happens When a Tip is

              </h2>
              <p>
                The CER’s model for confidential disclosure has four distinct
                phases:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  <strong>Receive</strong> &ndash; the CER receives a
                  confidential disclosure from a tipster by way of ClearView. If
                  the tip includes any information that could identify the
                  tipster it is removed before any actions take place. Should
                  the CER staff receive a tip directly, they will encourage the
                  tipster to make the disclosure to ClearView in order to ensure
                  the proper process channels are followed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Assess</strong> &ndash; the CER will review and assess
                  the disclosure provided and determine a course of action.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Action</strong> &ndash; the CER will take action and
                  respond to the disclosure. Examples of action may include
                  compliance verification activities or referring the disclosure
                  to another lawful authority or regulator.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Conclude</strong> &ndash; all disclosures are then
                  closed out either with or without an enforcement action.
                  Examples for reasons of non-enforcement actions may include:
                  closing the disclosure on grounds of insufficient information,
                  not falling within CER jurisdiction, not being in the public
                  interest (considerations include timeliness, seriousness of
                  the allegation), or at completion of the CVA.

                Guidance for Tipsters: Reporting Alleged allegations
              </h3>
              <p>
                The CER assesses all allegations of non-compliances brought
                forward through our Confidential Disclosure (Whistleblower)
                Process Guide. This guidance is to help ensure the information
                you provide is complete, so that we may act as quickly as
                possible. Disclosures should provide specific details such as:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>Specific dates and locations</li>

                  The name of the individual or individuals alleged to have

                <li>
                  Information about whether the alleged act of non-compliance

                <li>
                  Information about how the company responded or failed to

                <li>
                  Reasons (if any) why the company was not advised of the

                  Other information such as documentation, incident reports,

              </ul>
              <h3 id="s3_2">Submitting in Writing vs. Verbally</h3>
              <p>
                Individuals may report either in written form or verbally
                &ndash; however written is preferred for a number of reasons
                that benefit both the CER and the tipster:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  Important information could be omitted, misinterpreted or
                  misunderstood by both parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the event that a tipster is the subject of a reprisal, the
                  tipster must be able to demonstrate that he or she has
                  actually reported the alleged act of non-compliance. An
                  allegation made in writing is a substantially more definitive
                  record.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Written communication is often the best way to safeguard
                  anonymity because the tipster can control content and provide
                  fewer personal details.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="s3_3">Assessing the Elements of a Disclosure</h3>
              <p>
                The content and accuracy of the disclosure is important so as to
                efficiently process the allegation. The elements and factors
                that can affect the assessment of disclosures include:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  <strong>Good Faith</strong>.  Disclosures that appear to be
                  frivolous or extortive will not be assessed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Act of Non-Compliance</strong>. Activities reported
                  must meet the CER’s definition of non- compliance.
                </li>

                    >Recentness of the Alleged Act of Non-Compliance</strong
                  >. Acts of non-compliance that are alleged to have occurred
                  months or years ago may be more difficult to verify and prove.
                  The sooner the disclosure, the better.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Quality of Disclosure</strong>. Disclosures that are
                  based on second hand information, vague accounts, and
                  generalities are generally more difficult to process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Within CER Jurisdiction</strong>. Disclosures need to
                  fall within the CER’s jurisdiction. If the matter does not, it
                  may be concluded or referred to the appropriate lawful
                  authority.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Public Interest</strong>. The DEC will assess whether

              <p>
                After conducting a preliminary assessment of the disclosure, the
                CER will decide on a course of action.  The next steps could
                include:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>

                  >
                  &ndash; If the CER decides that it requires additional
                  information or clarification from the tipster before it can
                  reach an informed decision, it will contact the tipster via
                  ClearView Connects. It will be up to the tipster to log-in to
                  the system to check for messages. The tipster is under no
                  obligation to reply to a request for additional information.

                  >
                  &ndash; If the alleged act of non-compliance is a matter that
                  is not under our jurisdiction no further actions will be
                  required. The tipster will be notified through the reporting
                  system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>No Follow-Up Required</strong> &ndash; If it is
                  assessed that the disclosure is not suitable to justify
                  compliance verification activities due to not meeting the
                  requirements then it may be concluded. The tipster will be
                  notified through the reporting system.

                  &ndash; If the assessment is that the disclosure is suitable
                  for compliance verification activities, it shall be assigned
                  to a specialist. The specialist will be provided with the
                  edited version of the tipster’s original disclosure only.
                  After the specialist has completed compliance verification
                  activities and any enforcement activities the Tipster will be
                  notified via the reporting system.

              <p>
                Anyone who brings information forward related to alleged
                non-compliances will be protected. Section&nbsp;6.3(1)(a) of the
                CER’s Onshore Pipelines Regulations requires regulated companies
                to have a policy for the internal reporting (Whistleblower
                Policy) of hazards, potential hazards, and near misses that
                includes the conditions under which a person who makes a report
                will be granted immunity from disciplinary action. The CER has a
                mandate to review such policies pursuant to this regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding a breach of this section, the CER has no
                authority to compel a regulated company to rehire a person that
                the regulated company has terminated. In the event that a
                tipster makes an allegation of a reprisal to the CER, the matter
                will be recorded and assessed &ndash; with possible actions
                taken by the CER.

<h2 id="s1">1. Background</h2>
<p>The analysis of both historical and more recent major hazard accidents has revealed that organizational culture, specifically the values, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours related to safety and risk<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>, may positively or negatively influence safety and environmental protection outcomes.</p>
<p>In May 2013, a special meeting of North American oil and gas regulators was convened to discuss improving safety and environmental outcomes by leveraging safety culture. Representatives from the National Energy Board (NEB), Canada Newfoundland Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB), Canada Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB), United States’ Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and the United States’ Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) identified several opportunities to move a concerted safety culture effort forward, including:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Building a shared understanding of the term safety culture among regulators and regulated companies alike</li>
<li>Articulating clear regulatory expectations as they relate to safety culture</li>
<li>Collaborating on the development of reference and resource material for industry in order to provide clarity and consistency in terminology and safety culture dimensions and attributes, where possible.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) and the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC) joined the working group. This group, known as the North American Regulators Working Group on Safety Culture (NARWGSC), has focused on exploring ways that regulators might support the improvement of safety culture across industry through research, learning, and sharing.</p>
<h2 id="s2">2. The Safety Culture Indicators Research Project</h2>
<p>Early on, the NARWGSC recognized the need for a tool that could be used to gather and share valuable insights about how culture influences safety and environmental protection outcomes. The Safety Culture Indicators Research Project was initiated to meet this need; its objective was to identify a suite of indicators that could be used to facilitate greater awareness and understanding of cultural threats and defenses in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p> The project engaged operational staff at each of the NARWGSC agencies in order to identify the nature and scope of safety culture signals observed during interactions with regulated entities. The tool was developed for potential use by regulators; however, the NARWGSC members committed to share the results with stakeholders and other interested parties in an effort to support a culture of learning across the sector.</p>
<h2 id="s3">3. Project participants</h2>
<p>All project participants were regulatory staff from member agencies of the NARWGSC. Regulatory personnel that had experience conducting inspections, investigations, audits or high-level meetings with company leadership were invited to participate in the study. Effort was made to include staff from all regulatory disciplines (e.g. safety, integrity (engineering), emergency management, security, and environmental protection).</p>
<h2 id="s4">4. Project methodology</h2>
<p>One-on-one interviews (in person or by telephone) were conducted with participants. These interviews were confidential. The information collected and submitted for analysis was de-identified; the only data collected about the specific interviewee was the functional activity that best described the nature of their regulatory duties (e.g. inspection, investigation, audit, conducting of company meetings). No other personal identification information was recorded. Company names mentioned in the course of the interview were also removed prior to submission for analysis.</p>
<p> During the interviews, a representative<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> from the NARWGSC asked the participant a series of questions related to safety culture signals observed during prior regulatory activities. Questions were also asked about each participant’s knowledge of safety culture. Please see <a href="#nnxa">Appendix&nbsp;A</a> for the complete list of interview questions.</p>
<p>Fifty interviews were conducted. The qualitative data collected during the interviews were examined, separated, and coded based upon topic area. The coded data were then analyzed further to identify emerging themes. These themes were correlated with various safety culture frameworks (e.g. the NEB, CNSOPB and C-NLOPB’s Statement on Safety Culture<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> framework, the framework proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>, and the framework proposed by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>) in order to complete a cursory validity check.</p>
<p>Each indicator was classified for presentation purposes based upon its relevance to four Safety Culture dimensions Safety Leadership Commitment; Vigilance; Empowerment and Accountability; and Resiliency. These dimensions are consistent with the positive dimensions found in the aforementioned Statement on Safety Culture.</p>
<p> Finally, each indicator was structured within a Safety Culture maturity model, which allowed for the depiction of the dynamics associated with Safety Culture and the natural process that tends to occur in companies committed to Safety Culture improvement &ndash; cultural maturity is realized over time.</p>
<h2 id="s5">5. Outcomes: The Suite of Indicators</h2>
<p>The complete suite of indicators developed as a result of this research project may be found in <a href="#nnxb">Appendix&nbsp;B</a>.</p>
<p>The indicators have been crafted so that they may be universally applied to any organization regardless of size, activity or facility type. Further, the suite has been designed such that they can be used comprehensively or selectively to fit the unique needs of an organization.</p>
<p>The indicators do not measure Safety Culture directly; instead they point to organizational signals of strength or weakness that may provide an indication of the relative health of the culture.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the indicators are not a final product intended to represent a list of prescriptive regulatory requirements, an audit protocol or a detailed action-oriented plan for achieving safety culture within a company. Instead, they provide additional reference material and guidance about the attributes of a Safety Culture at various stages of development.</p>

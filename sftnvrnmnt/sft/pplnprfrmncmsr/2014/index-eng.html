          <h2 id="msr">Pipeline Performance Measures - Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This report marks the second year of the National Energy Board
            publishing pipeline performance measures gathered from
            Board-regulated companies. It includes data from 2013 and 2014
            reporting years.
          </p>
          <p>
            This reporting strengthens the Board&rsquo;s proactive approach to
            protecting the public and the environment. Performance measures are
            a necessary component of effective safety management systems as they
            focus on both improving the performance of systems designed to
            prevent possible incidents (leading indicators), and measuring
            pipeline incidents after they have occurred (lagging indicators).
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB expects that industry leadership will use its management
            systems&rsquo; policies, goals, processes, and procedures to
            formally communicate their values and expectations. Through this
            formal communication, executive management establishes the initial
            framework of the corporate culture. Where a company is strongly in
            tune with establishing and maintaining a positive safety culture, it
            scrutinizes, as a normal business function, every decision to ensure
            that risk is considered and managed appropriately. It sets
            performance measures that provide a complete picture of the
            company&rsquo;s current state in order to identify areas of weakness
            and to proactively manage safety to prevent incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014, the Board released a Safety Culture Framework intended to
            promote learning and a shared understanding of safety culture in the
            pipeline industry. Both the performance measures and safety culture
            initiatives build awareness of the role that management systems and
            culture plays in contributing to or building defenses against
            accidents. Incidents can be attributed to a breakdown in technology
            or management system elements, but they are often because of safety
            culture, as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board sees the information gathered for these primarily leading
            performance measures as an incentive for companies to set even more
            company internal performance measures for key programs required in a
            robust management system. A comprehensive set of measures informs
            employees on the performance being measured and the results are able
            to be tracked over time to contribute to continual improvement in
            operations and to contribute to a more positive safety culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data generated from the measures in this report will also be
            used by the Board to better regulate pipeline operations. The NEB
            recognizes it takes a few reporting cycles to identify meaningful
            trend information. However, the Board is now using the performance
            measures data to inform its compliance verification planning. Data
            from these leading indicators are incorporated into the NEB&rsquo;s
            risk-informed modelling and analysis. This additional information
            provides the Board with a more complete picture of regulated
            companies&rsquo; pipeline operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also evaluates the performance data to determine if
            companies are providing information that is consistent with the
            Board&rsquo;s knowledge of the pipeline and if they are planning the
            appropriate numbers of safety-related activities. If, in the
            Board&rsquo;s view, there are inconsistencies, the Board will take
            action.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Performance Measures Data Format</strong></h3>
          <p>
            The performance measures were developed through a public
            consultation to cover key activities in the programs required by the
            NEB:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Safety Management</li>
            <li>Security</li>
            <li>Emergency Management</li>
            <li>Integrity Management</li>
            <li>Environmental Protection</li>
            <li>Damage Prevention</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To facilitate the reporting and subsequent sharing of data, each
            performance measure is quantitative in terms of numbers, percentages
            and ratios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the measures are to be reported on a pipeline-system basis.
            However, there are certain measures that must be reported either on
            a pipeline-specific basis, or for facilities. These exceptions have
            been indicated in the guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data was received from 26 companies owning a total of
            58&nbsp;pipelines with a total length of 67,700&nbsp;kilometres. The
            data was grouped in categories based on product (liquid or gas) and
            length of pipeline (greater than 50&nbsp;kilometres and less than or
            greater than 5000&nbsp;kilometres).
          </p>
          <p>
            This report includes performance measure data for 2014 as well as
            the two-year 2013/2014 average. This shows the comparison between
            the 2013 and 2014 data and at the same time shows what the baseline
            would be. In future reports there is the potential to show trends by
            graphing the annual results. The data format in this report is
            illustrated in the following figure:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="brdr-tp brdr-rght brdr-bttm brdr-lft  mrgn-rght-md "
              >&nbsp;49&nbsp;</span
            >&#8594; 2014 Data<br />
            <span class="brdr-tp brdr-rght brdr-bttm brdr-lft  mrgn-rght-md "
              >&nbsp;51&nbsp;</span
            >&#8594; 2013/2014 Average
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Guidance </strong></h3>
          <p>
            Guidance is provided with each measure to enhance the accuracy of
            company reporting, provide common understanding, and encourage
            consistent application for reporting purposes. In addition,
            definitions, descriptions of terms, and interpretation are included.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Implementation </strong></h3>
          <p>
            These performance measures are also posted on the Board&rsquo;s
            website (www.neb-one.gc.ca) in the Safety and Environment section.
          </p>
          <p>
            The submission of performance measure data is mandatory for
            companies selected by the Board given the number of kilometres of
            pipeline they own. The Board has directed these companies to
            electronically submit the data (for the previous calendar year) by 1
            April of each year. The reporting form and the instructions for
            submission are available on the Board&rsquo;s website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies that are new to the Board&rsquo;s jurisdiction should seek
            advice from the Board to determine if they should report on the
            measures. However, all companies are encouraged to use these
            measures in their integrated management system.
          </p>
          <h3>Observations Regarding Data Reported</h3>
          <p>
            Program-specific observations provide some indication of the company
            performance relative to planned activities and between different
            categories of pipelines.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Safety Management</em></h4>
          <p>
            The safety management performance measures all had high achievement
            percentages in each category of pipeline. In 2014 there were more
            corrective actions for liquid pipelines due to construction
            activities.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Security Management</em></h4>
          <p>
            In 2013 some companies had a significantly lower percentage of
            employees receiving security training. The NEB subsequently
            clarified requirements and the percentage of trained employees
            increased in 2014 from 88 to 93%.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Emergency Management</em></h4>
          <p>
            Planned emergency management liaison activities (with agencies
            involved in an emergency situation) exceeded planned activities and
            increased over 2013. In addition, the percentage participation on
            emergency management exercises increased in 2014.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Integrity Management Measures</em></h4>
          <p>
            There are several measures for this program.  Key observations are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Approximately two thirds of features, such as potential cracks or
              corrosion, identified by inspections are found to be defects and
              then repaired or mitigated. This indicates a high degree of
              accuracy in the interpretation of inspection tool data.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2014 a greater amount of features were identified and a
              corresponding amount of defects were repaired than in 2013.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4><em>Environmental Protection</em></h4>
          <p>
            Employee Environmental Protection Program training showed 10,348
            persons were trained - 800 more than in 2013. The number of
            environmental issues increased and their resolution decreased. 
            (Outstanding issues are to be addressed in subsequent calendar
            years.)
          </p>
          <h4><em>Damage Prevention</em></h4>
          <p>
            These measures relate to tracking pipeline crossing permissions and
            unauthorized crossing activities. This information allows for an
            assessment as to (1) whether awareness programs are effective, and
            (2) the trends for public awareness of pipelines.  The results for
            2014 show a significant improvement over 2013 in that every type of
            activity, except those conducted by contractors, had less
            unauthorized activities and significantly more permissions. The
            greatest improvement was in landowner interactions with pipelines in
            general and in municipal interactions with large gas pipeline
            companies. Overall there was a decrease in unauthorized activities
            from&nbsp;591 to&nbsp;165.

          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of this measure is to track completion of safety
            inspections planned for facilities so as to prevent harm to
            employees, the public and the environment. This supports
            Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>u</em>) of the
            <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em> (OPR),
            which requires a process for inspecting and monitoring in order to
            evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of a safety management
            program.

          <h4>What is a “facility”?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, a facility is integral with a
            pipeline and may include pump stations, compressor stations,
            metering stations, mainline block valve yards, tank farms, terminals
            and launcher and receiver yards. This definition is consistent with
            the facilities identified in the Canadian Standards Association
            (CSA)&nbsp;Z662, <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em>.<sup

          <h4>
            What is an “inspection”?
          </h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, an inspection is a workplace
            inspection conducted at a field facility in accordance with the
            requirements of a company’s facility integrity and/or safety program
            management system. An inspection may include facility and equipment
            inspections conducted for both process safety and workplace safety
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspections conducted to follow up on corrective actions are not
            recorded for this measure (see Safety Management Performance

            component of a safety program, they are not included in this measure

            The purpose of this measure is to support
            paragraphs&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>r</em>), (<em>u</em>) and (<em>w</em>) of
            the OPR with regard to the tracking of corrective and preventative

            reduce the potential for safety incidents. This measure is not
            focused on the completion of actions in the same calendar year they
            were identified. Rather, as mentioned above, the focus is on the
            completion of actions in a timely manner.

          <h4>What is a “corrective and preventative action”?</h4>
          <p>
            A corrective and preventative action is an action that the company
            has determined is necessary based on findings from internal
            inspections, audits and investigations. The reported data would
            include both corrective and preventative actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            An investigation is any assessment of an unsafe situation from a
            near miss to an incident. If any investigation generates corrective
            and/or preventative actions then these actions are considered a
            corrective and preventative action for the purposes of this measure
            and therefore should be reported.
          </p>
          <h4>
            How are corrective actions tracked if they are identified in one
            calendar year, but addressed in another calendar year?
          </h4>
          <p>
            It is recognized that some actions are not able to be addressed in
            the calendar year that they are discovered. For example, some may
            require more time than others, or some actions may be identified too
            late in the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any corrective and preventative actions not completed in a calendar
            year are carried over to the next year. These actions are then
            identified in the management system at the start of the next
            calendar year. They will be supplemented with new actions identified
            over the course of that calendar year.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “construction”?</h4>
          <p>
            Construction activities are those conducted by employees,
            contractors or any other persons involved in the construction of a
            pipeline.

          <h4>What is a “near miss”?</h4>
          <p>
            A near miss is an undesired event that under slightly different
            circumstances could have resulted in harm to people, or damage to
            property, equipment or the environment. Near misses apply to
            operation, maintenance and construction activities conducted by a
            company. Near misses do not apply to other companies, public or
            third party incidents on pipelines as these events should be managed
            under a damage prevention program.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for a company to properly report on this measure, it may

            near misses are reported and reviewed. Such reporting should be
            included in a company safety management program in accordance with
            paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>r</em>) of the OPR.
          </p>
          <h4>What do “addressed” and “competent person” mean?</h4>
          <p>
            Addressed means that a determination of need for corrective and/or
            preventative action was made and where appropriate corrective and/or
            preventative action was taken. In some cases no action may be
            required. However, a determination must be made promptly to assess
            the risk and the need for corrective and/or preventative action.
          </p>
          <h5><em>Competent Person for a Pipeline Company:</em></h5>
          <p>
            The determination of a need for action at a company must be
            conducted by a person who is competent (i.e.&nbsp;a person who is
            qualified, trained and experienced to conduct safety incident
            investigations). A determination of need for action must also be
            reviewed by an appropriate authority (i.e.&nbsp;management) to
            confirm that the determination was appropriate, that related
            learning is incorporated, and that information has been shared with
            workers to increase awareness and prevent similar occurrences.
          </p>
          <h5><em> Competent Person for a Contractor:</em></h5>
          <p>
            The determination of a need for action at a company may also be
            conducted by a contractor if:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              the near miss resulted from an action taken by the contractor; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the contractor is competent (i.e.&nbsp;the contractor is
              qualified, trained and experienced to conduct safety incident
              investigations).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            A determination of need for action must be reviewed by an
            appropriate authority. In the case of a contractor, the appropriate
            authority is either:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              the contractor’s management (and then the pipeline company must be
              advised of the determination); or
            </li>
            <li>the pipeline company’s management.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The review by the appropriate authority must be undertaken in order
            to confirm that the determination was appropriate, that related
            learning is incorporated, and that information has been shared with
            workers to increase awareness and prevent similar occurrences.

          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            Employees are a company’s greatest security asset; all employees
            must have knowledge of the company security management program, as
            well as their role and responsibilities within the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            This measure will gather data on the company’s security training
            program.
          </p>
          <p>
            This information collected as a result of this measure should not
            include data on a company’s security awareness process. The NEB
            recognizes that security awareness initiatives (such as posters,
            bulletins or notices on a company’s intranet, etc.) are valuable
            components of a company’s overall security management program.
            Nevertheless, security awareness initiatives do not replace the need
            for training for each employee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subsection&nbsp;6.5(1) of the OPR states that a company shall, as
            part of its management system,

              duties in a manner that is safe, ensures the security of the
              pipeline and protects the environment;

          <h4>Who is a “company employee”?</h4>
          <p>
            This measure applies to all employees of a company. This includes
            employees that are involved in regular, abnormal or upset conditions
            on NEB-regulated pipelines. It also includes employees who are
            working in the same location as these employees but are not directly
            involved with NEB-regulated pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company management system should identify any consultants and
            contractors that require security training. This measure also
            applies to these consultants and contractors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>l</em>) of the OPR requires that a company
            establish and implement a process to make persons working on behalf
            of a company aware of their responsibilities.
            Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>q</em>) of the OPR requires that a company
            establish and implement a process for coordinating and controlling
            operational activities of employees or other people working with or
            on behalf of the company so that each person is aware of the
            activities of others.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “current security training”?</h4>
          <p>
            Current security training means that as of the end of the reporting
            period an employee has the required training as set out in the
            company’s security training program. The company’s security training
            program will define what level of training every employee requires
            and the length of time between initial and follow-up training.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Clause&nbsp;8.3.2 of CSA&nbsp;Z246.1,
            <em>Security Management for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems</em>,
            recommends a 24-month recurring timeline for training, companies are
            expected to define the timeline for follow-up training within their
            management system, based on security training needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The type and extent of training may vary depending on an employee’s
            position and location in the company. For example, an employee
            working in a corporate environment may receive training regarding
            handling mail or on protection of information measures. Operations
            employees working at field locations may receive training on
            suspicious activity and photography, or on recognizing and handling
            suspicious packages. Finally, employees with a designated security
            role may receive enhanced training on documenting, reporting and
            managing security incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Security training is a structured learning event with a means of
            assessing employee competence. Examples include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>computer-based module with a test/exam; or</li>
            <li>instructor-led training with a test/exam.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This performance measure does not require a company to report the
            type of security training provided to employees. However, companies
            are expected to track this information internally along with its
            other performance measures for security for inclusion in the
            company’s annual report required under Subsection&nbsp;6.6(1) of the
            OPR. The NEB will review this material during on-site compliance
            activities.

          <h4>What is an “emergency response exercise”?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of these performance measures, emergency response
            exercises are defined as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Drills: a supervised activity that tests a single or specific
              operation or function. Drills are commonly used to provide
              training on new equipment, or test new procedures; to practice and
              maintain skills; or to prepare for more complex exercises. For the
              purposes of this measure, “man down” and fire drills are excluded
              and should not be reported.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tabletop Exercise: a facilitated analysis of an emergency
              situation in an informal, stress-free environment. A tabletop
              exercise is designed to elicit constructive discussion as
              participants examine and resolve problems based on existing
              operational plans and identify where those plans need to be
              changed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Functional Exercise: a single or multi-agency activity designed to
              evaluate capabilities and multiple functions using simulated
              response, without moving real people or equipment to a real site.
              A functional exercise is designed to evaluate management of
              emergency operations centers, command posts and headquarters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Full-Scale Exercise: a multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional activity
              involving the mobilization and actual movement of emergency
              personnel, equipment, and resources, as if a real incident had
              occurred.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Companies may report a real incident as an exercise if it meets the
            same objectives as the planned exercise, if the incident occurs in
            the region that a planned exercise was to occur, and if appropriate
            methodology is used.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What is the difference between a drill and a functional exercise?
          </h4>
          <p>
            A drill involves a single function, whereas functional exercises
            involve multiple functions. Drills involve the actual deployment of
            resources and personnel, whereas functional exercises use
            simulation.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s4_2">2. Communication</h3>
          <h4><strong>Guidance</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Companies are required under section&nbsp;33 of the OPR to establish
            and maintain liaison with the agencies that may be involved in an
            emergency situation. Under section&nbsp;34, companies must take
            reasonable steps to make sure that all parties are aware of the
            procedures to be followed in an emergency situation. The information
            provided by the company must be consistent with what is specified in
            the company’s Emergency Procedures Manual (EPM), required by
            section&nbsp;32 of the OPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of an emergency situation, the assistance of various
            first responders (e.g.&nbsp;fire, police and medical) as well as
            other parties may be required. Prior knowledge of potential hazards
            and individual roles by the company personnel, first responders and
            other parities prior to an emergency is critical for the safety of
            all involved.

          <h4>What are “parties”?</h4>
          <p>
            Parties include: police, fire departments, emergency medical
            services, and all other appropriate organizations (e.g.&nbsp;mutual
            aid partners, contractors, spill cooperatives), government
            departments and agencies (e.g.&nbsp;NEB, Transport Safety Board),
            Aboriginal groups where applicable, and persons who may be
            associated with an emergency response activity on or adjacent to the
            pipeline.
          </p>
          <h4>What are liaison activities?</h4>
          <p>
            A liaison activity is an exchange of information to gain mutual
            understanding and cooperation with parties that may be involved in
            an emergency situation. Examples of information discussed in an
            exchange of information include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the type and locations of a company’s facilities;</li>
            <li>
              all potential hazardous products transported in the pipeline
              and/or stored at company facilities in significant volumes;
            </li>
            <li>
              key roles of personnel and agencies involved in an emergency;
            </li>
            <li>response capabilities (e.g.&nbsp;of people, equipment); and</li>
            <li>
              emergency procedures and practices for dealing with an emergency
              consistent with those specified in the EPM.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Liaison activities reportable for this measure include: meetings,
            telephone conversations, information sessions, and presentations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of multiple parties participating in an integrated
            liaison event, each party that is participating can be considered a
            liaison activity for the purposes of this measure.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s4_3">3. Training and Competency</h3>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            Section&nbsp;46 of the OPR requires a company to develop and
            implement a training program for any employee directly involved in
            the operation of a pipeline. The section requires the training
            program to instruct the employee on the emergency procedures set out
            in the EPM and the procedures for the operation of all emergency
            equipment that the employee could reasonably be expected to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the EPM should list roles and responsibilities for
            employees and contractors of the company. The employees and
            contractor staff referred to in the measure are those identified as
            fulfilling a role in the EPM.

          <h4>How does a Contractor fulfill a role in the EPM?</h4>
          <p>
            Often contractors fulfill a company role in responding to an
            emergency on its behalf or performing critical roles for incident
            command. For the purposes of this measure, these contractors are
            considered equivalent to company staff. Contractors that are
            fulfilling contract requirements for equipment or supplies on an “as
            needed” basis are not to be included in this measure.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “trained”?</h4>
          <p>
            Trained refers to employee training on the emergency procedures set
            out in the EPM and response plans, as well as training on the
            procedures for the operation of all emergency equipment that an
            employee could reasonably be expected to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Employees and contractors working with the company on
            December&nbsp;31 of the year in which the measures are being
            reported on must be counted as trained for the purposes of this
            measure.  Employees and contractors who were trained earlier in that
            calendar year but who are no longer employed with the company are
            not to be counted as trained for this measure. Contractors that are
            on an “as needed basis” are also not to be counted as having been
            trained.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “up-to-date training”?</h4>
          <p>
            Up-to-date training means that at the end of the year being reported
            on, an employee or contractor has the required training. Training
            requirements for roles and responsibilities should either be in a
            training program, in a company management system or in the emergency
            management program. These processes should identify a frequency for
            training. An employee must meet the minimum requirements set out in
            these processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the reporting period the training records for all
            employees and contractor staff will be assessed to determine if the
            training is up-to-date with the company requirements. It is
            recognized that new employees may not have received all training by
            the end of the calendar year. However, the reported information must
            include all employees that have not met the training requirements,
            including new employees.

          <h3>Guidance</h3>
          <h4>What is an “emergency response exercise”?</h4>
          <p>
            Emergency response exercises and exercise frequency are discussed in
            Emergency Management Performance Measure&nbsp;#1.
          </p>
          <h4>What are “roles and responsibilities”?</h4>
          <p>
            The EPM should list roles and responsibilities for employees and
            contractors of the company. The employees and contractors referred
            to in the measure are those identified as fulfilling a role in the
            EPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an employee, identified as having a role in the EPM, has
            participated in several drills or exercises, that person should only
            be counted once.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “contractor”?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, a contractor is a person that is
            not an employee of the company but that fulfills a company role in
            responding to an emergency or performing critical roles for incident
            command on the company’s behalf. These contractors must perform this
            role full time and be integrated into the company’s training plan
            (as if they were company employees). Contractors that are fulfilling
            contract requirements for equipment or supplies on an “as needed”
            basis are not to be included in this measure.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What if an employee participates in an exercise in the United
            States?
          </h4>
          <p>
            The geographic location of an exercise or drill does not preclude
            its inclusion in the reported information, provided that the
            conditions of the exercise are similar to those encountered along
            the company’s pipeline. However, when possible, exercises should be
            conducted in Canada to test integration with Canadian agencies.

          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            This measure provides data which is a consideration in assessing the
            effectiveness of an Integrity Management Program (IMP) as per
            Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>u</em>) of the OPR. A company IMP should
            track activities, methods of obtaining the data, the resulting data
            and the mitigation. The actual field verified defects confirmed
            through field investigations versus the number of features
            identified by ILI for field investigation will provide a leading
            measure of the effectiveness of the IMP. It is expected that all
            field verified defects will be repaired or mitigated.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of processing times, permit approvals, weather
            restrictions and other such conditions, it is possible that field
            verification will not be executed within the same reporting year as
            the ILI. Only field verified data (e.g.&nbsp;Non-Destructive
            Examination (NDE) data) obtained in the year that is being reported
            on should be provided.

          <h4>What is an “ILI feature”?</h4>
          <p>
            An ILI feature is an unexamined deviation in pipe material or welds
            detected and/or reported by an ILI.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “metal loss”?</h4>
          <p>
            Pipeline metal loss is a reduction in wall thickness that is
            primarily due to corrosion, gouges and grooves. Metal loss defects
            are identified in accordance with Clause&nbsp;10.10.2.7 of
            CSA&nbsp;Z662 (corrosion) and Clause&nbsp;10.10.3 of CSA-Z662
            (gouges and grooves).
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “dent”?</h4>
          <p>
            A dent is a dent defects as described in Clause&nbsp;10.10.4.2 of
            CSA&nbsp;Z662.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “crack”?</h4>
          <p>
            Cracks include both mechanically driven and environmentally assisted
            cracking (e.g.&nbsp;Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC), Stress
            Corrosion Fatigue) on the pipe body, seam or girth weld, as defined
            by Annex&nbsp;H of CSA&nbsp;Z662.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to the relation between cracks and ILI reports, the
            company must identify how it will address all cracks as a result of
            ILI reports. Cracks are reported using a variety of terminology. An
            ILI feature reported as “crack-like”, “crack-field”, “seam-weld
            anomaly”, or other linear anomaly which could be interpreted to be a
            crack, must be considered as a crack for this measure.
          </p>
          <h4>Why do cracks greater than 40% need to be addressed?</h4>
          <p>
            Cracks of any length or depth are considered defects according to
            CSA&nbsp;Z662. However, ILI technologies may not be able to
            accurately size cracks deeper than 40% of the nominal wall
            thickness. Therefore, companies must further investigate all cracks
            deeper than 40% of the nominal wall thickness for repair or
            mitigation.
          </p>
          <h4>What method should be used to measure cracks?</h4>
          <p>
            Depths and lengths of crack features can be measured by buffing or
            non-destructive examination, ILI, or a combination of these.
            Consideration must be given to each method’s uncertainty when
            selecting features to be field-investigated (as described in
            Annex&nbsp;D of CSA-Z662).
          </p>
          <h4>If a “colony” of cracks is encountered how is it dealt with?</h4>
          <p>
            For a cracking colony (e.g.&nbsp;SCC), companies must report each
            crack feature within the colony with a depth greater than 40% of the
            nominal wall thickness.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Will reporting on this measure replace significant SCC reporting?
          </h4>
          <p>
            At this time, this reporting is not intended to replace significant
            SCC reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >If an engineering assessment is conducted, do the defects
              identified through ILI or field investigation still have to be
              included as if they were defects as defined under CSA&nbsp;Z662 or
              exceeding the 40% crack criteria?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes. Even though the engineering assessment could provide the
            criticality analysis that the feature or defect can remain in the
            pipeline without the immediate impact on integrity, such defects
            must still be reported, because they exceed the acceptability
            criteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, companies must still report the number of features or
            defects remaining in the pipeline exceeding the criteria provided in
            the measure. Companies may provide clarification related to further
            action taken or to be taken when reporting on the measures.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What does a company report when it has not performed field
            investigation and repairs or mitigation?
          </h4>
          <p>
            If a company has not performed any field investigation (excavation)
            including repairs or mitigation of features, or where no defects
            were field verified, then this measure should be reported as no
            defects found for repair or mitigation. Companies should only report
            on actual field verification activities.
          </p>
          <h4>What are “permanent or temporary repair methods”?</h4>
          <p>
            Defects can be repaired using temporary or permanent methods.
            Temporary or permanent methods can be found in Clause&nbsp;10.12 and
            Table&nbsp;10.1 of CSA&nbsp;Z662, respectively.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a defect mitigated by pressure reduction?</h4>
          <p>
            A defect mitigated by pressure reduction is a field verified defect
            that is being mitigated by means of a pressure reduction (to restore
            factors of safety in accordance with CSA&nbsp;Z662). Where a
            pressure reduction is performed as both a repair and mitigation
            measure to address a single defect, the defect subjected to the
            pressure reduction is only reported under Integrity Management
            Performance Measure&nbsp;#1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where multiple repairs and/or mitigations are performed on a complex
            defect, the company must report the number of individual defects
            found and repaired/mitigated in the complex defect. For example, for
            a crack in a dent, if the company used pipe replacement to remove
            both defects as the repair method, it would report two defects
            repaired.

            the public and the environment. This supports
            Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>u</em>) of the OPR, which requires a

          <h4>What is a “facility”?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, a facility may include pump
            stations, compressor stations, metering stations, mainline block
            valve yards, tank farms, and launcher and receiver yards. This
            definition is intended to be consistent with the facilities
            identified in CSA&nbsp;Z662.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What tanks and mainline valves are to be assessed - some or all?
          </h4>
          <p>
            All tanks and mainline valves that are suitable for service that
            have not been formally deactivated, decommissioned or abandoned are
            expected to be inspected.
          </p>
          <h4>What “tanks” are included?</h4>
          <p>
            A company shall include all tanks (see Clause&nbsp;4.15 of
            CSA&nbsp;Z662) that are part of the pipeline system or facility and
            have not been formally deactivated, decommissioned or abandoned.
            This includes sump tanks for laboratories.
          </p>
          <h4>What is considered a “mainline valve”?</h4>
          <p>
            Mainline valves are sectionalizing valves as defined in
            CSA&nbsp;Z662. Clause&nbsp;4.4.3 of CSA&nbsp;Z662 identifies where
            these valves may be installed. Generally these valves are installed
            between large sections of pipeline and are able to stop the flow in
            a pipeline section.
          </p>
          <h4>What does “scheduled inspection” mean?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, a scheduled inspection includes
            inspections, both initially planned (for the year being reported),
            as well as inspections that were subsequently added (during the year
            being reported). However, a scheduled inspection does not include
            corrective action (follow-up) inspections unless they are scheduled
            at the start of the year in which the measure is being reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, the number of completed inspections should not exceed
            the number scheduled.<sup id="fn1-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1">1</a></sup
            >
          </p>
          <h4>What is an inspection?</h4>
          <p>
            An inspection that is typically counted in this measure is one that
            has been scheduled in the following categories:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              Routine staff inspections (e.g.&nbsp;daily and monthly); and
            </li>
            <li>
              Certified inspections (e.g.&nbsp;according to a maintenance
              schedule which may or may not be linked to a required standard).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As a minimum, the company is required to report the number of
            inspections scheduled and conducted as required by CSA&nbsp;Z662
            (Clauses&nbsp;10.9.2.1, 10.9.3.1 and&nbsp;10.9.6.2). Certified
            inspections would be carried out in accordance with any standards

          <h4>What does “scheduled inspection” mean?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, a scheduled inspection includes
            inspections, both initially planned (for the year being reported),
            as well as inspections that were added (during the year being
            reported). However, this does not include corrective action
            (follow-up) inspections unless they are scheduled at the start of
            the planning year.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “piping inspection”?</h4>
          <p>
            An adequate and effective IMP should identify that piping
            inspections are to be conducted commensurate to the hazards (see API
            570, referenced within CSA&nbsp;Z662). This may include: visual
            inspections, non‐destructive testing inspections, cathodic
            protection surveys, pressure testing and other methods. Certified
            maintenance inspections are those that are conducted in accordance
            with a detailed maintenance schedule that should be guided by a
            standard such as API. Any above-ground and below-ground piping at a
            facility that carries product is to be included when reporting on
            this measure.

          <h4>What are “reportable incidents”?</h4>
          <p>
            A reportable incident refers to the definition of incident contained
            in the OPR. Reporting requirements for incidents, as defined in the
            OPR, are identified in section&nbsp;52 of the OPR.
          </p>
          <h4>What are “liquid facilities”?</h4>
          <p>
            Liquid facilities are above-ground or in vaults and include: pump
            stations, metering stations, mainline block valves, tank farms,
            terminals and launcher and receiver yards.
          </p>
          <h4>What are “gas facilities”?</h4>
          <p>
            Gas facilities are above-ground or in vaults and include: compressor
            stations, metering stations, mainline block valve, and launcher and

          <h4>How does a company report this measure?</h4>
          <p>
            Companies are to report this measure based upon integrity hazard
            assessment reports received in the year that is being reported on.
            Each hazard assessment method is to be identified for each hazard
            and if ILI is used for assessment then the ILI resolution must be
            recorded and reported.
          </p>
          <h4>What does “integrity hazard” mean?</h4>
          <p>
            An integrity hazard is any of the five pipeline integrity hazards
            identified in the measure that are encountered through digs or
            through integrity assessments. A section of pipeline may have more
            than one identified hazard. Each hazard will be assessed under more
            than one measure regardless of quantity and severity.
            Clause&nbsp;2.6.1 of Annex&nbsp;H of CSA&nbsp;Z662 describes the
            hazards in terms of primary causes of pipeline failures.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “susceptible hazard”?</h4>
          <p>
            A pipeline is considered susceptible to a hazard unless it has been
            demonstrated (e.g.&nbsp;through ILI, investigative digs) that the
            likelihood of this hazard condition is negligible.
          </p>
          <h4>What is included in a pipeline integrity hazard assessment?</h4>
          <p>A pipeline integrity hazard assessment is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              conducted for every pipeline integrity hazard. This means that
              there may be multiple measures based on the number of hazards for
              a pipeline; and
            </li>
            <li>
              validated with data from ILI, hydro-testing and direct assessment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A pipeline integrity hazard assessment must consider manufacturing,
            construction, testing and operational and maintenance records
            (e.g.&nbsp;operating pressures, repairs, growth rates, incidents),
            and condition monitoring.
          </p>
          <h4>What is to be reported for external interference?</h4>
          <p>
            The potential for external interference from unauthorized activities
            on the right-of-way exists on all portions of a pipeline. In this
            case the hazard is limited to pipeline depth of cover less than
            originally designed, as determined through surveys.
          </p>

          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            This measure is not a leading measure; it is a lagging measure.
            However, it provides an indication of a company’s safety culture by
            following the number of shutdowns to protect the public and the
            environment.

          <h4>What is a facility?</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to pipeline segments being shutdown, for the purposes of
            this measure, a facility shutdown may include pump stations,
            compressor stations, and tank farms. A facility does not include
            processing plants.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a shutdown for an “emergency”?</h4>
          <p>
            An emergency shutdown is for a condition that could include:
            overpressure, off-spec gas, geotechnical conditions, weather
            conditions, or release of product. For the shutdown to be considered
            an emergency it must occur within five&nbsp;days of the condition
            being identified.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “precautionary” shutdown (i.e.&nbsp;a false alarm)?</h4>
          <p>
            A precautionary shutdown (i.e.&nbsp;a false alarm) could occur where
            the control room operators proactively shutdown the system (based on
            approved procedures) when they are unable to identify the cause for
            various alarms on the system. A precautionary shutdown could also
            occur as a result of calls on the emergency line (before they are
            followed up with and determined to be a false alarm by company
            employees).
          </p>
          <h4>What is an “unplanned repair”?</h4>
          <p>
            An unplanned repair is a repair that was identified as being
            necessary between six&nbsp;days and 12&nbsp;weeks from an operations
            or maintenance activity such as an investigative dig. The unplanned
            repair must have been identified as being necessary as a result of
            the operations or maintenance activity. The decision as to whether
            to undertake an unplanned repair would be based on information
            obtained at the time of the activity.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “planned integrity testing, maintenance or repair”?</h4>
          <p>
            Planned integrity testing, maintenance or repair refers to a
            scheduled activity that should be in the IMP for the year that is
            being reported on. It may also be a shutdown that was planned more
            than 12&nbsp;weeks prior to the shutdown.

          <p>
            The intent of this measure is to gather data on the employees
            required to have training in the EP Program, and to determine
            whether these employees have received an appropriate level of
            training.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information collected as a result of this measure should not
            include data on a company’s environmental awareness process.
            Notwithstanding the fact that this measure does not apply to this
            type of data, awareness of the EP Program and of environmental
            protection in general should be promoted throughout a company, both
            in the office and in the field. In addition to the employees
            requiring training on the EP Program, the EP Program should also
            identify a process and procedures for implementation of an awareness
            process at corporate, regional and field offices.

          <h4>What is an EP Program?</h4>
          <p>
            Section&nbsp;48 of the OPR requires companies to develop an EP
            Program that anticipates, prevents, manages and mitigates conditions
            which could adversely affect the environment. EP Programs must be
            management-system based. Refer to Sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6 of
            the OPR for details regarding the requirements for a management
            system, and to section&nbsp;55 for internal audit requirements.
          </p>
          <h4>Who does this measure apply to?</h4>
          <p>
            This measure applies to all employees of a company that are required
            by the EP Program to have training on the program. The company’s
            management system will include a process for training and
            establishing competency requirements for employees for their
            assigned tasks related to environmental protection. In addition, the
            EP Program must identify all employees who have tasks that could
            involve supervising staff or observing situations where the
            environment may be impacted. Paragraphs&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>j</em>) and
            (<em>k</em>) identify requirements relating to the processes for
            training programs, competency requirements and supervision.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “company employee”?</h4>
          <p>
            A company employee includes employees that are involved in regular,
            abnormal or upset conditions on NEB-regulated pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company management system should identify any consultants and
            contractors that require EP Program training as substitute resources
            or provisional contractors. This measure also applies to these
            consultants and contractors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>l</em>) of the OPR requires that a company
            establish and implement a process to make persons working on behalf
            of a company aware of their responsibilities.
            Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>q</em>) of the OPR requires that a company
            establish and implement a process for coordinating and controlling
            operational activities of employees or other people working with or
            on behalf of the company so that each person is aware of the
            activities of others.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “training on the company-wide EP Program”?</h4>
          <p>
            Training on the company-wide EP Program is considered to be a
            structured learning event with a means of assessing competence. The
            level of training for each employee along with competency
            requirements will be appropriate to the level of accountability, and
            will be identified in the company’s management system-based EP
            Program. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              administrative staff working in the field might be required to
              take an overview with a quiz;
            </li>
            <li>
              managers, professionals and technical (e.g.&nbsp;construction,
              operation and maintenance) staff might take an on-line module with
              a test; and
            </li>
            <li>
              staff with direct accountability for environmental compliance,
              such as an environmental specialist/inspector, may be required to
              have formal classroom training with an exam.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>When should employees be re-trained?</h4>
          <p>
            Training must be up-to-date. Up-to-date training means that at the
            end of the year in which the measures are being reported on, an
            employee or contractor has the required training. This should also
            be identified in the EP Program or management system. However,
            re-training is recommended within five&nbsp;years due to advances in
            industry best practices and potential changes to legislation.
          </p>
          <h4>How is this measure reported?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, only employees that are employed
            with the company as of December&nbsp;31 in the year in which the
            measures are being reported on will be counted as completing the
            training identified in the EP Program.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_2">2. Site Specific Training</h3>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of this measure is to gather data regarding the level of
            training on a company’s EP Plans so that environmental impacts can
            be avoided and that appropriate action is taken if they occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            For both large construction projects and small maintenance digs, any
            employees and contractors on site are expected to be trained and
            competent for company environmental protection measures relevant to
            their assigned tasks.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h4>What is an EP Plan?</h4>
          <p>
            An EP Plan is a site-specific or project-specific plan designed for
            a construction project of any size where environmental impacts could
            occur. The EP Plan resides within the EP Program. The NEB
            <em>Filing Manual</em> contains additional information about EP
            Plans.
          </p>
          <h4>When is an EP Plan required?</h4>
          <p>
            An EP Plan is required for any activity that requires construction,
            repair or maintenance of a pipeline that has the potential to cause
            environmental impacts. The level of complexity of an EP Plan may
            vary. For example, for small maintenance digs, the EP Plan could be
            the company standard operating procedures (SOPs) that are identified
            in the EP Program.

            The intent of this measure is for companies to track the status of
            reclamation on right-of-way that is in agricultural production. It
            is the Board’s expectation that within a five year period, the
            right-of-way will be fully reclaimed to a condition similar to the
            surrounding environment and consistent with the current use of the
            land.

            To what precision must the length of pipeline right-of-way that is
            restored be reported?
          </h4>
          <p>
            The length of pipeline right-of-way that is restored is to be
            reported to a precision of 0.1 of a kilometre (100&nbsp;metres).
          </p>
          <h4>What is “agricultural land”?</h4>
          <p>
            Agricultural land is the land currently used for agricultural
            production for both crop and pasture. Woody vegetation crops
            (e.g&nbsp;orchards, berry shrubs, etc.) and native prairie are
            excluded. In addition, agricultural land use reserve that does not
            have a demonstrated production is excluded.
          </p>
          <h4>What does “restored” mean?</h4>
          <p>
            Section&nbsp;21 of the OPR, as well as CSA&nbsp;Z662 uses the term
            “restored”.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, restored means that the
            right-of-way is reclaimed or returned to a state comparable to the
            surrounding environment and that the desired agricultural land use
            of those lands affected is accommodated when it is reasonable to do
            so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though some forested land is designated as agricultural land, it is
            not expected that trees would be planted in the right-of-way in
            these circumstances unless there is a specific requirement for
            wildlife habitat restoration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Restoration of roads, railways and wetlands crossed by the pipeline
            within agricultural land are excluded from this measure.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “disturbed agricultural land”?</h4>
          <p>
            A right-of-way is considered disturbed agricultural land if there is
            an activity that breaks ground. This would include disturbances
            caused by pipe maintenance and new pipeline construction.
          </p>
          <h4>What is an “operational excavation”?</h4>
          <p>
            An operational excavation is an operations or maintenance activity
            that breaks ground to conduct a repair or investigation. It may
            occur at several locations along a pipeline. Each occurrence should
            be recorded and the reclamation for each occurrence should be
            tracked within the company management system for the EP Program.
          </p>
          <h4>How does a company report this measure?</h4>
          <p>
            All right-of-way that has been disturbed five&nbsp;years prior to
            the reporting year is to be assessed against the commitments made by
            the company in the original application for the pipeline, in the EP
            Plan and in compliance with the conditions of approval and the OPR.
            Therefore, any pipelines built during or after&nbsp;2009 would be
            reported on in&nbsp;2014. This measure includes newly purchased
            pipelines that are under construction, or new pipelines where
            post-construction monitoring is being conducted.
          </p>
          <p>
            This measure is not intended to be retroactive. Rather, it is

          <h4>What is an “operational environmental issue”?</h4>
          <p>
            An operational environmental issue is a liquid release, or an
            environmental issue that is identified as a result of monitoring and
            surveillance activities under the company EP Program or EP Plan.
            Operational issues are identified after the conclusion of the
            post-construction monitoring (either as voluntarily committed to or
            as a NEB condition of construction) and do not include right-of-way
            reclamation as a result of construction activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Operational environmental issues can include but are not limited to
            the topics in the following:

          <h4>What is “addressed”?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, addressed means that corrective
            action has been taken and, over a specified time, resolution will be
            achieved as committed to in either the company EP Program or EP
            Plan. For example, if a decision has been made to contain an oil
            spill to company property and monitor it until a point in time when
            remediation will occur (e.g.&nbsp;abandonment), then it has been
            addressed for the purposes of this measure. The issue should be
            under control and should no longer be causing additional adverse
            effects on the environment.
          </p>
          <h4>How does a company report this measure over five&nbsp;years?</h4>
          <p>
            To begin reporting, a company must have completed its post
            construction monitoring period (i.e.&nbsp;reclamation) as defined in
            the NEB conditions for the project or as defined in the company EP
            Program. Then a company must determine the number of operational
            environmental issues it currently has outstanding at the beginning
            of a calendar year. This will be determined from the EP Program or
            from its management system inventory of hazards.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              During the first year all new issues and all addressed issues will
              be recorded and tracked along with the initial list.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the second year the same process will occur and the first
              year’s results are reported on.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the third year the same process will occur and the previous
              two&nbsp;years are reported on.
            </li>
            <li>
              This process will continue until it becomes a moving five-year
              tracking process when, for example, in the seventh year, the
              report will be for year two to year&nbsp;six.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This performance measure will allow for ongoing tracking and
            trending of both the number of issues identified and the number
            addressed. The resulting ratio from the reported numbers could be
            considered as a rolling average. A company is encouraged to use the
            ratio in its own monitoring and analysis of this measure.

          <h4>What is an “inspection day”?</h4>
          <p>
            Each day that a qualified environmental inspector inspects a
            pipeline site is considered an inspection day. If two inspectors are
            on site on the same day for different aspects of construction then
            two inspection days should be reported. It is possible to have more
            inspection days than construction days on large sites where the
            length of the project calls for multiple inspectors.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “qualified environmental inspector”?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this measure, a qualified environmental
            inspector is a person who has relevant post-secondary education or a
            suitable equivalent (e.g.&nbsp;a combination of training and
            experience), has proven competency in the field of environmental
            protection, and has appropriate training on the company’s EP Program
            and EP Plan. The company management system must provide further
            detail on qualifications for environmental inspectors.
          </p>
          <h4>What is “newly constructed pipeline”?</h4>
          <p>
            Newly constructed pipeline would include pipeline replacements or
            new pipelines that require NEB approval under sections&nbsp;52
            and&nbsp;58 of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em>. Pipeline
            construction includes the clearing of land and does not include
            operational activities such as digs or repairs. This measure does
            not apply to pump stations, compressor stations, metering stations,
            mainline block valve yards, tank farms, launcher and receiver yards.
          </p>
          <h4>What is the construction period for this measure?</h4>
          <p>
            The construction period is from beginning of construction (which
            includes clearing) to the in-service date.

          <h3 id="s7_1">1. Public Awareness of Pipelines</h3>
          <h4>INTERPRETATION</h4>
          <p>
            In this measure, higher permissions and lower unauthorized
            activities result in a higher ratio. The ratio gives an indication
            of the effectiveness of damage prevention programs.
          </p>
          <h4>GUIDANCE</h4>
          <p>
            The NEB expects that a company’s Damage Prevention Program will
            follow a management system approach. A management system approach
            includes the development of:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              performance measures for assessing the company’s success in
              achieving its goals, objectives and targets;
            </li>
            <li>
              processes for identifying hazards and making sure that the hazards
              are mitigated and controlled; and
            </li>
            <li>a process for external communication of information.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This performance measure can be used to guide the implementation of
            a company’s damage prevention program and the communication plan for
            external party awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intent of this measure is for companies to report on
            unauthorized activity statistics by groups that are most likely to
            require permissions to conduct an activity in or near a pipeline
            right-of-way. These statistics should be used by a company to
            identify groups where Public Awareness Programs are particularly
            effective. They should also provide an indication of which groups
            require additional focus (for example, which groups may need
            awareness).

          <h4>What is an “unauthorized activity”?</h4>
          <p>
            An unauthorized activity that should be reported as part of this
            measure is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Unauthorized construction or installation across, on, along, or
              under a right-of-way;
            </li>
            <li>Excavation using power-operated equipment;</li>
            <li>
              Explosives within the 30&nbsp;metre (100&nbsp;foot) safety zone;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              Any contravention of the
              <em>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</em> (PCR), Part&nbsp;I and PCR
              Part&nbsp;II, including any activity of the facility owner, as
              defined in section&nbsp;2 of the PCR, Parts&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II, or
              an excavator that the pipeline company considers to be potentially
              hazardous to a pipe.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What is the definition of “permission”?</h4>
          <p>
            Permission means the consent given by a pipeline company to a
            facility owner (as defined in section&nbsp;2 of the PCR,
            Parts&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II) or to an excavator to construct or install
            a facility or to excavate. For example, permission from the pipeline
            company is required for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              construction or installation of a facility across, on, along, or
              under an existing right-of-way;
            </li>
            <li>
              excavation using explosives or power-operated equipment over the
              right-of-way;
            </li>
            <li>
              in certain circumstances, operation of a vehicle or mobile
              equipment across a right-of-way, outside the travelled portion of
              a highway or public road; and
            </li>
            <li>
              excavation using explosives or power-operated equipment within the
              30&nbsp;metre (100&nbsp;foot) safety zone.

          <h4>How is this Measure Reported?</h4>
          <p>
            This measure should be reported based on the person that conducts
            the physical activity on the right-of-way. In most cases, that
            person will be a contractor hired by the Project Owner (usually, the
            Project owner is one of the categories identified in this
            performance measure, for example, a municipality).
          </p>
          <p>
            For example if the Project Owner is a municipality that receives
            permission for an activity on a right-of-way, but hires a contractor
            that performs an unauthorized activity, it is the contractor that is
            the subject of the measure.
          </p>
          <h4>What is a “contractor”?</h4>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this performance measure, a contractor is an
            excavator (i.e.&nbsp;a company or individual) hired to perform an
            activity which results in a ground disturbance. By extension the
            contractor is any agent, affiliate or subcontractor of the
            contractor that has direct control over the person performing the
            excavation.
          </p>
          <h4>What is the “other” category?</h4>
          <p>
            This includes but is not limited to any entity or person that may
            conduct activities in a pipeline right-of-way that does not fit into
            the Municipal, Contractor or Landowner categories. Typically this
            would be a provincial, federal, railway or utility entity.

          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB) hosted a Technical Workshop on
            Quality Assurance for Pipeline Fittings (Workshop) on
            28&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;29&nbsp;June 2017. This initiative was one of
            the steps that the NEB took in the first phase of Quality Assurance
            of Pipeline Fittings Project (Project). It is important to note that
            there have been no failures on in-service NEB-regulated pipelines as
            a direct result of fittings not fully meeting specifications. The
            NEB, as Canada’s federal pipeline regulator, is committed to
            influencing improvements in the pipeline fittings supply chain.
            Although it does not regulate fitting manufacturers, the NEB still
            looked to facilitate broad dialogue on this important quality
            assurance issue between various stakeholders to further the goal of
            preventing incidents that could compromise the safety of people or
            harm the environment. Experts from pipeline companies, distributors,
            manufacturers, regulators, academia, consulting companies and
            standards associations attended the workshop. The purpose of the
            Workshop was to discuss ideas that could be developed into actions
            or solutions to improve quality assurance for pipeline fittings
            throughout the supply chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Workshop was held over the course of 1.5&nbsp;days and included
            presentation sessions, a breakout session and a final wrap up
            session. As a result, possible actions were identified that would
            improve the quality assurance for pipeline fittings and other
            components.
          </p>
          <p>
            In advance of the workshop, a technical paper (<a
              href="/sftnvrnmnt/sft/pplnmtrls/2017-50-31pplnfttngsppr-eng.html"
              >Paper</a
            >) sponsored by the NEB was commissioned. The paper included
            10&nbsp;possible strategies to be adapted by stakeholders in the
            supply chain to provide more assurance that pipeline fittings are
            produced and installed with the required material properties. The
            goal of the Paper was to inform discussions at the workshop in the
            form of a breakout session. On day&nbsp;two, workshop attendees
            gathered at each of the eight breakout tables and discussed one (in
            some cases two) of the proposed strategies in the Paper. The results
            of each breakout session were recorded and then presented to all
            attendees for group discussion.

              position on the topics that were discussed.</strong
            >
            In the process of finalizing this summary report the NEB solicited
            feedback from all Workshop participants to ensure the report
            accurately captures the discussions that took place during the
            Workshop. Over 50% of the participating organizations responded and
            provided feedback on the summary report, as well as additional
            thoughts on the discussions that took place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comments that fell outside of corrections to the content of the
            summary report will be reviewed and considered in the second phase
            of the Project. After further review of the discussions and
            suggestions that are outlined in this report, the NEB will determine
            any actions that it may take. In the interim, the NEB will continue
            its work with various stakeholders including the Canadian Standards
            Association (CSA).

          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB) hosted a Technical Workshop on
            Quality Assurance for Pipeline Fittings on
            28&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;29&nbsp;June 2017. Facilitation of this
            Workshop was one of the steps that the NEB took in the first phase
            of Quality Assurance of Pipeline Fittings Project (Project). It is
            linked to Safety Advisory SA 2016-01A2 and a Draft Order which would
            require NEB-regulated companies to report to the NEB on pipeline
            fittings that do not meet specifications. Information on these
            measures is available on the NEB’s website:

            The workshop was held over the course of 1.5&nbsp;days as per the
            program in <a href="#nnxa">Appendix&nbsp;A</a>. There were a total
            of 9&nbsp;presentation sessions, a breakout session where all
            attendees were divided into groups to discuss one (or in some cases
            two) strategies each, and a final wrap up session where each group
            presented the outcome of their discussions. Peter&nbsp;Watson, the
            CEO of the NEB, provided the opening and closing remarks for the
            Workshop.

            The objective of the breakout session was to discuss the strategies
            that were outlined in the Paper within the context of people,
            process and technology and discuss possible actions that could be
            taken by manufacturers, operators, distributors, standards bodies
            and regulators. The summary of these sessions are as follows:
          </p>
          <h3 id="s4_1">
            Strategy&nbsp;1 &ndash; Quality Management Systems (QMS)
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is recommended, as a minimum, that the pipeline operating company
            require QMS alignment from suppliers of pressure-carrying pipe and
            fittings and their upstream suppliers, as well as the pipeline and
            facilities construction contractor(s). There are actions that can be
            taken by all parties along the supply chain to help in achieving
            this goal. Some of such actions are outlined in the following
            paragraphs in this section.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that the operating companies have a relationship
            with manufacturing and distributing companies. Operating companies
            should maintain a list of approved manufacturers (AML) and
            distributors (ADL), and should require distributing companies to
            follow the operating companies’ AML. It is also important to have a
            better feedback loop with the manufacturing and distributing
            companies to follow up on identified issues. There is general
            consensus among manufacturers that some of the “quality inspectors”
            who purchasers send to manufacturing facilities are poorly trained
            and instructed. This leads to production inefficiencies, unnecessary
            rejections or rework, and extra costs for manufacturers. Operating
            companies should exercise more control over training and competency
            of third party inspectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manufacturing and distributing companies should have a QMS, and
            those seeking a listing on an AML or ADL should be required to
            demonstrate effectiveness of the QMS. However more effort is
            required in implementation of all the elements of their QMS. One
            area in particular that was discussed as requiring more attention is
            training of personnel and ensuring that qualified people are on the
            job. When selecting a sub-vendor (e.g., for starting materials or
            services), manufacturing companies must have clear and pre-approved
            criteria. They also need to have a fitting recall process in place
            and maintain a better feedback loop with operating companies and
            distributors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pipeline regulators should engage with other regulators (e.g., NEB,
            Alberta Energy Regulator, BC Oil and Gas Commission, Pipeline and
            Hazardous Materials Safety Administration), accreditation bodies
            (e.g., International Standard Organization (ISO) and standards
            development organizations (e.g., CSA, Manufacturers Standardization
            Society, American Society of Mechanical Engineers) that have
            influence or insight into current manufacturing practices. It is
            also important that the regulators are more engaged with smaller
            operating companies for better insight into their QMS. Regulators
            should influence the standards to address modern manufacturing
            processes and raise the level of minimum requirements. They should
            also provide example guidelines such as minimum requirements for
            QMS.

            Non Destructive Testing (NDT). The MPS should clearly identify the
            audited and approved suppliers of raw materials, consumables, and
            component parts, in a manner that is traceable to the products
            supplied, and the quality management practices utilized during the
            production of these materials and receipt of such materials at the
            manufacturer’s facility.

          <p>
            In development of ITP the following should be included as
            appropriate: testing frequency, hold points, acceptance criteria,
            calibration requirements, personnel qualification, reporting, and
            document retention. Additional information, where applicable should
            include:

            <li>Supplemental testing of similar materials</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There has to be a continuous feedback loop between MPS and ITP,
            including discussions on checks and balances.

            It is important to leverage cross sector best practices and lessons
            learned (e.g., aviation and auto industry). There are rigorous
            processes and procedures that already exist for manufacturing of
            line pipe. The pipe requirements could be adapted to the fittings
            selection as well (e.g., requirements for submission of MPS and
            ITP). It is also beneficial to engage with working groups in
            Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) and The Interstate
            Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA). Collaboration of parties
            can help in producing an express knowledge document that could
            provide helpful guidance into the industry standards such as
            CSA&nbsp;Z245.11 and MSS&nbsp;SP-75.

          <h3 id="s4_4">Strategy&nbsp;4 &ndash; Manufacturing Traceability</h3>
          <p>
            Manufacturing companies should consider collecting their data at a
            more granular level. Consideration should be given to recording the
            unique identification of each manufacturing component, raw material
            and/or consumable to enable traceability. Quality control
            documentation, collected for a process such as heat treatment,
            pressure test, NDT results, test pieces, and mechanical and
            metallurgical test results should be traceable to the batch of
            finished goods. There is a manufacturing concern however for
            managing the smaller diameter fittings that are produced in high
            quantities. For this reason it is suggested to define a range of
            applicability for traceability of fittings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Industry standards can be improved to include traceable raw
            material, heat treatment, and testing data for those products not
            project specific. Standards should require traceability of component
            size, furnace, heat treatment time, and temperature. Serial numbers
            could become the unique identifier of all the information expected
            to be collected. There should be a requirement for providing minimum
            information behind a serial number in the standard to ensure
            traceability in the event something goes wrong (e.g. notice of early
            potential failure in the event if the manufacturer goes out of
            business or is acquired by another company). Standards should also
            outline requirements for a mandatory Certified Material Test Report
            (CMTR) where manufacturing location and origin of materials such as
            steel is noted, an example is EN 10204, which describes requirements
            for CMTRs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Operating companies and distributors should consider periodic
            visiting and re-auditing of the manufacturer(s) as part of their AML
            maintenance. The manufacturing traceability records of applicable
            fittings should be maintained and in an accessible, digital format
            after the component is installed. Unique identifiers assigned to
            fittings and tied to geospatial locations and manufacturing
            traceability records facilitate the future locating and assessment
            of any fitting that is related to possible performance deficiencies.
            The pipeline operator may employ tracking software that integrates
            with manufacturer systems and maintains product traceability from
            raw material through to installed location. The operating company
            would be accountable for maintaining all the records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consideration should be given to the concept of a data audit or
            assessment, similar to a third party inspector. The data/records
            that are produced through manufacturing become the only tangible
            records of operational assets &ndash; quality of the data in these
            data records is imperative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the traceability data can form the baseline of modern
            pipeline operations that include preventative instead of reactive
            analytics. Operators should consider leveraging the electronic asset
            data to their benefit to streamline and optimize their operations
            while also meeting potential new data retention requirements.

          <p>
            Material inspection and testing requirements are specified in the
            MPS and ITP, specific to the material being manufactured and the
            manufacturing process. Operators in most cases supplement contracts
            with additional requirements. Processes that are observed in audit
            are typically better controlled, and infrequent inspection may
            result in snap shots that are not representative of full production.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is little to no traceability of distributor sourced fittings
            relative to the steel or plate mills, unlike the traceability in
            place for line pipe. CMTR reviews and post procurement chemical
            analysis suggest that low carbon or lean alloying chemistries having
            larger standard deviations may be an issue that when combined with
            variable uncertainties in heat treatment practices, generally result
            in substandard material properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that the fittings be given a similar level of
            importance as the line pipe so they do not become the weak link. It
            is beneficial to put a mandatory requirement in place for a third
            party certification (or a NORSOK<sup id="fn1-rf"

            approach). As mentioned in the previous section, unique identifier
            requirements should be put in place for serialization of the
            fittings. Regular auditing should be scheduled to ensure these
            traceability requirements are being implemented. There is also an
            apparent need for a governing body in this area, or perhaps the
            implementation of a similar approach to NORSOK’s. It is important
            that small pipeline companies can have the same quality assurance
            even when they purchase from the distributors.

            There are also existing technologies that could be employed for raw
            (or final) material inspection and verification. One of such
            technologies is Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) for
            nondestructive determination of chemical composition. Consideration
            should also be given to measuring hardness at specific points on the
            fitting to provide directional indication with regard to tensile
            strength as well as uniformity of material hardness across the
            envelope of the fitting. There are hardness measuring devices
            available that use a depth-load indentation which are capable of
            generating a stress strain curve (resulting in YS and UTS values)
            for a material when given enough measurement points.

            Strategy&nbsp;7 &ndash; Manufacturing Procedure Qualification (MPQ)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The issues with mechanical properties arise during the manufacturing
            process and are most associated with heat treatment. There are many
            variables involved in heat treatment, all of which can create
            unintended differences in tensile strength and other mechanical
            properties from the baseline established in the CMTR. These include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>General temperature control</li>
            <li>
              The variability of temperatures in different locations (within the
              furnace)
            </li>
            <li>Contact with pallets or other support systems</li>
            <li>
              The effect of heat treatment on areas of differing wall thickness
              within a fitting
            </li>
            <li>The time taken to transfer a fitting to the quenching bath</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Heat treatment issues are largely associated with fittings having
            specified minimum yield strengths (SMYS) greater than 359 MPa
            (Grade&nbsp;359, Y52). These fittings require greater levels of heat
            treatment and are more sensitive to micro-alloying and time windows
            for quenching. The materials and processes to achieve Grade&nbsp;359
            or lower grade materials have been established for many years and
            are well understood. Steel manufacturers typically make one class of
            materials that are suitable for Grade&nbsp;359 and lower and another
            class of materials that are suitable for Grade&nbsp;359 and higher.
            The latter materials are generally suitable for the heat treatment
            and quenching processes that are used to achieve higher yield
            strengths.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some companies attempt to mitigate perceived risk by specifying
            additional wall thickness. This can be counter-productive because as
            wall thickness increases, the potential for variability in the
            effectiveness of heat treatment also increases, particularly for
            wall thicknesses above 25mm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deviations from any of the qualification production parameters such
            as furnace loading plan, furnace hold times, quench media
            temperature or agitation can result in substandard products even if
            the industry standard requirements are ostensibly met. This effect
            is compounded if multiple deviations in production parameters occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MPQ can be used to validate manufacturing conditions specified
            for the MPS. The MPQ concept also introduces the idea of essential
            variables for manufacturing. For example, If a fitting is qualified
            with a time delay of 3&nbsp;minutes from furnace door opening to
            quench tank immersion, what reasonable tolerances could be applied
            on the time delay for production manufacturing?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is necessary to standardize and narrow the standard deviations of
            the control parameters in the materials, manufacturing, and
            heat-treatment procedures. Deviations in essential variables should
            result in rejection or reprocessing of fittings. Procedures have to
            be specified at the process design stage. Standardization should
            apply to all operating companies and fitting manufacturers uniformly
            in order to avoid the possibility of any party being subjected to
            commercial disadvantage. As such, the standardized procedures should
            contain the control parameters (soak and transfer times,
            thicknesses, furnace and quench tank temperatures etc.).
            Consideration should be given to enhancement of qualified Non
            Destructive Examination (NDE) methods to supplement destructive
            testing of fittings. It is important to specify minimum training
            requirements for manufacturing personnel, including training with
            respect to the original process qualification tests. The possibility
            of using analytical design (to a recognized piping code) and quality
            control/ assurance processes in lieu of or supplementary to proof
            testing should be explored. Development of an express document or an
            annex to the appropriate standard (e.g., CSA&nbsp;Z245.11) would
            appear to be the most feasible way to implement improvements.

          <h3 id="s4_9">Strategy&nbsp;9 &ndash; Procurement</h3>
          <p>
            Fittings are procured through distributors based on a listing of
            pre-qualified manufacturers commonly known as AML. The manufacturers
            are subject to future removal from the purchasers’ AML should
            substandard or non-conforming materials be identified during (or
            after) the procurement acceptance and testing process. It is also
            beneficial if the operating companies maintain a list of approved
            raw material manufacturers. As a result the fitting manufacturer
            will be obliged to purchase from approved mills only.
          </p>
          <p>
            Procurement policies and procedures including manufacturer
            pre-qualification and periodic review should be reviewed or
            developed in the standard operating practices to ensure pipeline
            operator quality strategies are transferred to all parties in the
            supply chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Operating companies should provide comprehensive purchase orders
            (PO) that require the manufacturer/ distributor be prequalified and
            have adequate quality controls before purchasing materials. Project
            planning should allow for timely ordering of the required fittings.
            Training and educating the distributors is another necessary
            qualification step. Both operating and distributing companies must
            train their procurement personnel to have an understanding of
            production, manufacturing and technical specifications of the
            procured fittings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manufacturers should follow an approved list of suppliers (plate,
            pipe, welding filler material, milling, heat treatment, forging),
            that has been accepted by the purchaser. There should also be a
            sign-off authority on the manufacturing side to approve the finished
            product. Similarly a sign-off authority should exist on the
            distributor and operating company side to approve that the purchased
            product meets all the necessary specifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feasibility of creation of a governing body in this area could be
            explored. Development of a Monogram&trade; Program<sup id="fn4-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>4</a
              ></sup
            >
            similar to American Petroleum Institute’s (API) could prove
            beneficial. The regulatory body should enforce this program, the
            operator company should require it from the manufacturer and the
            manufacturer should implement it. In case of failure, the ownership
            should lie with the governing body (similar to the nuclear
            industry).

          <h3 id="s4_10">Strategy&nbsp;10 &ndash; Acceptance and Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Pipeline operating companies should conduct pre- and post-purchase
            testing/screening processes for manufacturer and distributor
            supplied fittings. It should also request and review CMTRs against
            its chemical and mechanical specifications prior to acceptance.
            Prior to delivery to the job site, the pipeline operator should
            visually inspect the component and conduct magnetic particle
            inspection (MPI) of the pipe ends and any suspect areas. Wall
            thickness needs to be spot checked in addition to the checks
            initiated in areas identified by the visual inspection. In part to
            avoid weldability issues in the field, the pipeline operating
            company should not allow substitutions of higher yield, lower wall
            thickness materials without conducting engineering assessments
            and/or engineering designs. The trend has been for purchasers to
            specify lower carbon-equivalencies combined with higher yield
            strengths. This can be challenging for manufacturers as there is a
            direct correlation between carbon-equivalency and yield strength.
            The manufacturers generally agree that 0.43 to 0.45 is a reasonable
            range. Many companies specify 0.42 and some have attempted to go
            below 0.40. The carbon equivalent (CE) value should be reviewed at
            the CMTR evaluation stage against pipeline operating company
            specifications, welding procedures, and applicable CSA and API
            standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alignment between standards (e.g., CSA, MSS, API and ASME) is
            required in terms of chemical, mechanical and dimensional properties
            and treating fittings with similar level of importance as the line
            pipe. Requirements for CMTR must be standardized with the ability to
            verify and trace the product to its source. The manufacturer is the
            only body that can issue the CMTR. The development of a joint annex
            on inspection in CSA and MSS is beneficial. The timing of inspection
            and inspector’s competency requirements should be outlined in the
            annex and a third party inspection to become mandatory. As mentioned
            earlier, fittings have to have traceability.

                  To help standardize processes and create uniform product
                  requirements, the NORSOK set of specifications were created in
                  the 1990s. They are managed by Standards Norway on behalf of
                  the various Norwegian industry participants. As an addition to
                  typical “material” NORSOK specifications, a “qualification”
                  specification named M-650 was also established to ensure
                  improved quality verification for critical materials. While
                  NORSOK M-650 began as a manufacturing qualification specific
                  to the Norwegian offshore industry, it has become a trusted
                  certification around the world as many large end users have
                  begun to rely on the qualification across their global
                  operations.

                  CMTRs are associated with steel heats and qualified
                  manufacturing processes, not necessarily to the individual
                  fittings which are produced with those materials and
                  processes. The ideal way to verify mechanical properties is
                  through so-called “first article testing”, destructive testing
                  of one of each batch of fittings produced. However, since
                  fittings are often produced in very small batches, first
                  article testing is not cost effective or practical for
                  manufacturers or purchasers and is rarely done.

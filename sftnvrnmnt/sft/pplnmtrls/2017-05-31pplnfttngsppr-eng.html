              Objective: This paper examines current quality assurance
              requirements and processes and procedures used to validate pipe
              and components on pipeline systems and identifies any gaps or
              shortcomings in the quality assurance specifications that allow
              pipe or fittings to be manufactured that do not meet the intended
              material quality requirements.

          <h2 class="text-primary">Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Recently, pipeline operating company quality assurance measures have
            identified fittings that did not meet specifications. As a result,
            on 5&nbsp;February 2016, the Canadian National Energy Board (the
            NEB) issued a Safety Advisory and Miscellaneous Order (M0-001-2016)
            regarding substandard material. On 12&nbsp;April 2017, the NEB
            issued a Notice of Intention to Order followed by an amended Safety
            Advisory SA-2016-01A2 on 12&nbsp;May 2017. The amended Safety
            Advisory identifies additional fitting cases where material
            properties did not meet Company specifications, while the
            Miscellaneous Order will enable the NEB and Companies to identify
            any such fittings on existing pipelines, so that fitness for service
            can be assessed and appropriate mitigation measures can be
            implemented if required. This paper examines current quality
            assurance requirements and processes and procedures used to validate
            pipe and components on pipeline systems and identifies any gaps or
            shortcomings in the quality assurance specifications that allow pipe
            or fittings to be manufactured that do not meet the intended
            material quality requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Microalloyed high strength steels are very sensitive to changes in
            manufacturing processes such as thermomechanical rolling and heat
            treating. This sensitivity compounds small deviations in
            manufacturing processes such as tempering or quenching temperature.
            To minimize the risk of substandard materials, the initial process
            qualification often referred to as First Article Inspection<sup
              id="fn1-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a
              ></sup
            >
            forms the basis for all subsequent manufacturing procedures and the
            Manufacturing Procedure Specification (MPS) when applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables such as heat treatment and quenching temperatures, hold
            times, furnace load configurations, etc. should be sufficiently
            detailed to allow for quality control monitoring. Initial
            qualification testing should be rigorous and clearly define the
            resultant material properties as related to the product
            specification. Finally, the MPS and Inspection and Test Plan (ITP)
            should sufficiently describe the process such that production
            inspection is efficiently and thoroughly conducted. Deviations from
            the process need to be quickly identified and supplemental testing
            utilized to define the impact. A robust system of traceability
            should allow for all materials affected by a process disruption to
            be identified and segregated to prevent their entry into the supply
            chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, standards for fittings lack the detail and rigor
            associated with line pipe. Enhancements to current industry
            standards are recommended to close the gaps identified between
            standards, manufacturing processes and the intended fitting
            performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The failure of components to conform to existing standards and
            specifications, as investigated in this report, is a direct result
            of failures to control the manufacturing processes. These failures
            in processes were not identified by the established ITP protocols,
            either during production monitoring or subsequent material
            acceptance lot testing. First Article Inspection and production
            monitoring is generally conducted for larger mill runs such as major
            construction projects. Smaller projects generally rely on
            manufacturers and distributors to provide fittings meeting industry
            standards with limited or no additional oversight.

          <p>
            On 20 January 2017, the National Energy Board (NEB) issued a Request
            for Proposal (RFP) for provision of a Pipeline Materials Quality
            Assurance Technical Paper (the Paper). The request is to provide the
            NEB with a technical paper that examines current quality assurance
            requirements and processes and procedures used to validate pipe and
            components on pipeline systems and identifies any gaps or
            shortcomings in the quality assurance specifications that allow pipe
            or materials to be manufactured that do not meet the intended
            material quality requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, pipeline operating company quality assurance measures have
            identified fittings that did not meet specifications. As a result,
            on 5 February 2016, the NEB issued a Safety Advisory and
            Miscellaneous Order (M0-001-2016) regarding substandard material.
            The Order required companies to file with the NEB a report detailing
            any such fittings in use on the pipeline operating companies’
            systems, to identify whether these fittings have been identified as
            having substandard materials, and plans for mitigation should
            substandard materials be identified. If a company was unable to
            determine if the referenced fittings were purchased and installed,
            then it was to provide a corrective action plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            As described in the RFP, the issue of some of the fittings not
            meeting the required material specifications is not considered by
            the NEB to represent a significant or immediate public safety or
            environmental risk, because all fittings in service would have
            passed commissioning hydrotests. Also, the NEB is not aware of
            reported releases of gas or liquid product as a result of fittings
            not meeting specifications.
          </p>

            Pipeline components for the purpose of this paper refers to
            manufactured fittings such as elbows, tees, extruded headers,
            reducers, and caps intended for oil and gas service. Fabricated
            assemblies which may contain multiple components are excluded.
            Components are wrought or forged from raw material such as pipe,
            plate or billets. Components undergo a forming process or shaping
            process involving hammering, pressing, piercing, extruding, rolling,
            bending, welding, machining, or a combination of two or more of
            these operations. Following forming, components are heat treated to
            provide final design strength and toughness. Heat treatment may
            include one or more of the following methods:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Stress relieving where the component is heated to a temperature
              below the transformation range for a specific period of time and
              allowed to cool in the furnace or air.
            </li>
            <li>
              Normalizing where the component is uniformly heated above the
              austenitic transformation range, held to achieve uniform
              temperature throughout the mass of the component, and cooled in
              air.
            </li>
            <li>
              Normalizing and tempering where the component is reheated
              following normalization to a temperature below the transformation
              range, held for a specific time, and cooled in the furnace or air.
            </li>
          </ul>

            52), quenching and tempering is required to achieve the desired
            final properties. Quenching and tempering is a process that heats
            the steel to the fully austenitic range (normalizing) and rapidly
            quenches the material to achieve a microstructure with high strength
            and hardness. Toughness of the material is reduced during this
            process, but addressed by tempering. This increases toughness
            without having a significant impact on strength. The end result is a
            steel with a good balance between strength and toughness.

            Component manufacturers are required to comply with the requirements
            of a quality management system such as ISO 9001<sup id="fn3-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"

            >. In addition, proof tests may be required to verify the adequacy
            of the manufacturer’s design. Depending on the standards and
            purchaser requirements specified, additional mandatory testing is
            conducted to ensure production materials or components conform to
            the requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typical pipeline operating company integrity management and quality
            assurance provisions to ensure fittings conform to the intended
            design include a combination of company specifications, supplemental
            production testing requirements, inventory control, and acceptance
            testing. The main provision continues to be the pre-commissioning
            (post construction) hydrostatic pressure test. Depending on the
            intended service, pipeline components are subject to pressure
            testing at increments of the designed operating pressure. Less
            common are material and dimensional tests upon receipt of the
            component to identify substandard materials. Additional risk factors
            and integrity inspection steps are discussed below.

          </h3>
          <h4 id="s3_1_1" class="text-primary">3.1.1 Published events</h4>
          <p>
            The NEB is aware of instances of pipe and components having
            substandard material properties installed on pipelines under NEB or
            another regulatory bodies’ jurisdiction<sup id="fn4-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>4</a
              ></sup
            >. In the cases examined, the documentation received from the
            manufacturers indicated that the materials provided met the required
            specifications. Subsequent testing indicated that some of the pipe
            and fittings did not meet all the required material specifications.
            In some instances, the substandard materials were determined to have
            been a contributing factor to pipeline failure during pressure
            testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although some of the substandard materials cases described below
            appeared to have been isolated, the NEB subsequently identified
            additional cases on pipelines in Canada and the United States (US).
            The issue of pipe and fittings having substandard material
            properties entering the supply chain, and subsequently being
            installed on pipelines, is an industry wide concern.
          </p>
          <h5>Canadoil Asia Fitting Case</h5>
          <p>
            In December 2010, the NEB was notified of a steel fitting (elbow)
            that had expanded following a hydrostatic test at a pipeline
            facility in the US. PHMSA attributed the cause of the elbow
            expansion to the fitting having a yield strength lower than the
            specified minimum yield strength. The pipeline operator removed a
            number of other fittings at the facility for mechanical testing and
            identified additional fittings with substandard material properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The substandard fittings were traced to a manufacturer identified as
            Canadoil Asia<sup id="fn5-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>5</a
              ></sup
            >
            with production originating from Thailand. The fittings were
            manufactured to the Manufacturers Standard Society (MSS) SP-75
            Specification for High-Test, Wrought, Butt-Welding Fittings and were
            indicated as having met the specified material requirements on the
            Material Test Report (MTR). However, due to inadequacies in some
            processes at the manufacturing plant, not all fittings met the
            specified material requirements.
          </p>
          <h5>Ezeflow Fitting Case</h5>
          <p>
            In 2013, a pipeline rupture occurred on a sweet natural gas pipeline
            in Alberta. An estimated 16.5&nbsp;million cubic meters of natural
            gas was released. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB)
            released its Pipeline Investigation Report on the incident
            (P13H0107) on 3&nbsp;November 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investigations by the TSB, the NEB, as well as the pipeline
            operator, indicated substandard materials were present in the
            manufactured elbow where the failure initiated. Fitness for service
            testing was conducted on the pipeline fittings prior to their
            installation in 2008, after two fittings failed during the pressure
            test. Although hardness testing indicated the elbow in question had
            lower mechanical properties, the operator determined that the elbow
            was acceptable for use, as the wall thickness would compensate for
            the lower mechanical properties. Neither the manufacturer nor the
            pipeline operator physically verified the wall thickness of this
            specific fitting. The investigation determined that the wall
            thickness was less than that indicated on the MTR.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this incident, the pipeline operating company has increased
            its manufactured fitting (wall thickness) specifications beyond the
            manufacturing standards acceptable under the current Canadian
            Standards Association (CSA) Z662-15 Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems.
            The fitting manufacturer, Ezeflow, has made improvements to both its
            manufacturing procedures and its quality assurance (QA) programs.
            The quality issue appears to be limited to Grade&nbsp;550 elbows
            manufactured for a single customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2008, the US Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous
            Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) observed hydrostatic test
            failures and excessive expansions on a number of pipelines under
            construction in the US. Upon investigation, PHMSA attributed the
            cause of the incidents to the installation of pipe with substandard
            material properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2009, PHMSA issued an advisory bulletin (ADB-09-01) warning of
            the potential for microalloyed high strength line pipe to exhibit
            inconsistent chemical and mechanical properties, with yield
            strengths as much as 15&nbsp;percent below specified requirements.
            The advisory also warned that in some cases, the pipe materials may
            successfully pass a hydrostatic test but still present a future
            concern.

            3.1.2 Pipeline Operating Company interviews
          </h4>
          <p>
            DNV GL conducted interviews with representatives of two pipeline
            operating companies to further understand the issues experienced
            including details of their subsequent review and analysis.
          </p>
          <h5>Operator&nbsp;A:</h5>
          <p>
            Operator&nbsp;A identified most of the issues in elbows formed from
            plate which were related to the material yield strength relative to
            the specified material grade. The pipeline operating company
            typically purchases fittings from distributors unless a major
            project allows for direct procurement from the manufacturer. Heat
            treatment of all substandard fittings consisted of quenching and
            tempering. Although the fittings were specified and documented as
            CSA&nbsp;Grade&nbsp;483 (WPHY&nbsp;70), subsequent transverse
            tensile testing revealed actual strengths with values in the 300s.
            No axial testing was conducted. Traceability to the plate
            manufacturer was not maintained, but subsequent chemical composition
            testing matched mill supplied Certified Mill Test Reports (CMTRs).
            Hardness testing also revealed large differences from end to end of
            the fitting. It is the pipeline operating company’s assessment that
            loss of process control during quenching resulted in non-uniform
            cooling and variability in material properties from the initial
            entry of the fitting into the quenching tank to the final immersion.
          </p>
          <h5>Operator&nbsp;B:</h5>
          <p>
            Operator&nbsp;B identified furnace loading practices that affected
            normalizing of the fittings which resulted in localized areas of
            inadequate heat treatment. The stacking of fittings in the furnace,
            and use of certain steel support racks effectively increased the
            overall thickness and mass of the material to be heated and hence
            the hold time in the furnace. A sharp contrast was observed when
            lighter gauge racks (less mass) were used to load the furnace, and
            when spacing between the fittings was maintained. In both cases, the
            manufacturing procedure did not address the relative increase in the
            fitting localized mass (thickness) relative to furnace hold time. In
            one case, worn racks had deformed to the point that the contact area
            was significantly expanded and may not have conformed to the
            requirements of the original manufacturing procedure qualification
            tests. Much like welding processes, critical variables such as
            fitting wall thickness associated with heat treatment should be
            identified and included in MPS and ITP procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            A separate issue identified involved the adequacy of quenching
            following normalization. In this case the temperature of the
            quenching medium was not monitored and maintained to assure rapid
            cooling of the products. Quench tanks did not provide for continual
            measurement of water temperature or required agitation to ensure
            consistent cooling rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lot testing incorporating coupons was found to be inadequate to
            identify substandard materials. Lots, or batches of similarly
            produced components, were judged to be too large to differentiate
            between production processes, and the location and number of coupons
            was found not to be representative of process conditions during heat
            treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wall thickness variability was also identified as part of the review
            but was not considered detrimental. However, specific issues related
            to the absence of raw material (plate) traceability, material
            receipt inspection, and comprehensive acceptance testing were the
            primary drivers for these substandard fittings to enter the supply
            chain.

            CSA&nbsp;Z245.1-14, Steel Pipe and CSA&nbsp;Z662-15, Oil and Gas
            Pipeline Systems were reviewed to provide a comparison to standards
            specific to fitting manufacture. In general, standards for fittings
            lack the detail and rigor associated with line pipe. Enhancements to
            current industry standards are recommended to close the gaps
            identified between standards, manufacturing processes and the
            intended fitting performance. Pipeline operators and/or distributors
            should consider enhancing product specifications to provide more
            rigorous traceability, process monitoring and product testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the fitting standards reviewed, MSS&nbsp;SP-75 was the most
            comprehensive relative to the selected criteria. However, gaps
            remain relative to traceability, raw material handling and
            inspection, chemical composition and lot testing. Emphasis is placed
            on the control of manufacturing processes by requiring production
            specific MPS and ITPs, the acceptance and surveillance of which is
            the responsibility of the purchaser. In practice, this has the
            potential to cause a gap between the standard and finished goods if
            the MPS or ITP is incomplete, or is not monitored for conformance
            during production.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSA&nbsp;Z245.11-13 Steel Fittings has similar gaps relative to raw
            materials and raw material verification. The standard makes no
            reference to establishing manufacturing procedures similar to a MPS
            for monitoring the various processes involved in the manufacture of
            fittings. The reporting requirements are less stringent than those
            within MSS&nbsp;SP-75. The standard requires a Certificate of
            Compliance with limited mandatory test reporting requirements.
            Optional reporting requirements are left to the purchaser to include
            in the purchase order. As discussed below, this creates a low
            threshold for monitoring and reporting production process parameters
            of fittings produced for distributor stock or aftermarket resale.

          <p>
            The procurement of materials and goods has a significant impact on
            the overall quality of the finished pipeline. This includes the
            procurement of line pipe and components such as fittings, valves,
            flanges, closures, etc. It is essential that contractors, suppliers,
            and the pipeline operating company achieve alignment on quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The source of the pipe and fittings should be carefully considered
            during the materials procurement and inspection phase. Pipe and
            fittings purchased in millrun quantities provide the flexibility to
            impose project-specific specification requirements that exceed the
            minimum requirements of the applicable industry specification. Pipe
            and fittings purchased from distributor’s or manufacturer’s stock
            can often include materials that meet only the minimum requirements
            of the applicable industry specification. In addition, they may not
            have had the benefit of supplemental mill audits and inspections
            that are common for mill production runs of pipe and fittings.
            Rigorous mill pre-qualification practices and pre-purchase
            inspection have proven to mitigate risks associated with stock
            fittings. Pre-qualification can identify manufacturing facility
            inadequacies such as worn equipment, inadequate furnace surveying,
            quench tank mixing, etc. Pre-purchase inspections can also identify
            geometric, wall thickness, chemistry, and finishing issues prior to
            individual fittings entering the supply chain.

            5.1 Quality Management Systems (QMS)
          </h3>
          <p>
            When required by the pipeline operating company, contractors and
            suppliers should have their own QMS which is aligned with the
            pipeline operating company’s QMS. Where materials or goods are
            purchased on behalf of the pipeline operating company by a third
            party such as a distributor, the pipeline operating company’s QMS
            should be transferable and adopted by the purchaser. In addition to
            the QMS, manufacturing processes require additional process
            documentation, review, and control to facilitate meeting the
            required quality, schedule, delivery, and overall project objectives
            including performance specifications and regulatory requirements.
            This section is applicable to pipe manufacturers, pipe coaters,
            double jointers, component manufacturers, and other parties who
            provide materials or products, rather than services.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is recommended, at minimum, that the pipeline operating company
            require QMS alignment from suppliers of pressure-carrying pipe and
            components, as well as the pipeline and facilities construction
            contractor(s).

          <h3 id="s5_2" class="text-primary">
            5.2 Development of Manufacturer Procedure Specifications (MPS)
          </h3>
          <p>
            When required by the pipeline operating company or referenced
            standard, the supplier shall provide a manufacturer procedure
            specification (MPS) detailing manufacturing processes, quality
            assurance methods, quality control activities inclusive of hold
            points, and a description of applicable geometrical checks, material
            testing, and NDT. The MPS should be evaluated prior to the start of
            production for conformance with customer specifications, industry
            standards, and the intended service of the product (sour, high
            temperature, arctic, etc.). Exceptions to the specification taken by
            the supplier should be carefully considered to assess the likelihood
            that the final product performance will meet the project criteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            A pre-production meeting should be held to identify roles and
            responsibilities of the manufacturer, purchaser and/or surveillance
            inspectors. Meeting minutes should be retained and any agreed upon
            changes incorporated into the MPS prior to the start of production.
            When materials are to be purchased periodically from distributor’s
            stock the expectation is that the company would have described the
            QMS requirements to the supplier with enough lead time that the
            supplier could relay the QMS requirements to the manufacturer and
            coordinate the preparation of the related audits, inspections, and
            documentation, if applicable. Distributors and suppliers should keep
            records of original product specifications, MPS and ITP when
            required during production (i.e. fittings originally manufactured to
            MSS&nbsp;SP-75), and any pre-production meeting minutes. Alternative
            plans for documenting data and information pertaining to material
            testing, properties and inspection may be necessary if some
            provisions of the QMS are impractical for components purchased on a
            less frequent basis or for those having less impact on project risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MPS should clearly identify the suppliers of raw materials,
            consumables, and component parts, and the quality management
            practices utilized during the production of these materials. The MPS
            should also detail the requirements for any documentation provided
            by raw material, component part, and consumable suppliers in support
            of the manufacturer’s QMS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MPS should detail each step in the manufacturing process and
            describe the operation in sufficient detail to verify and confirm
            the process meets industry standards, regulatory requirements, and
            purchaser specifications. Manufacturing process controls and set
            points should be specified for monitoring during production.
            Examples sections within a MPS include but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Quality control measure options selected to improve the quality;
            </li>
            <li>
              Training and competency requirements for personnel performing the
              activity;
            </li>
            <li>Inspection requirements;</li>
            <li>
              Training and competency requirements for the personnel performing
              the inspection; and
            </li>
            <li>Applicable records.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The quality plan should reference the documented procedure or
            specification for the task. Additionally, the personnel performing
            the task or inspection should be able to understand and competently
            follow the procedure and quality plan and self-check their work, as
            applicable. However, self-checking is not a suitable substitute for
            inspection by other personnel who were not directly involved in the
            performance of the manufacturing or fabrication task. If quality
            issues are identified, work should be stopped or the component
            quarantined and the issue should be communicated to the appropriate
            personnel. Depending on the project, the personnel performing the
            activity and the inspection may be employed by the pipeline
            operating company, contractor, or supplier. Consideration should be
            given to multiple reviews of tasks or activities, as warranted.

            5.3 Development of Inspection and Test Plans (ITP)
          </h3>
          <p>
            When required by the pipeline operating company or referenced
            standard, required tasks for materials manufacturing shall include
            an ITP developed to establish activities or processes subject to
            monitoring, documentation review, when witnessing or verification
            activity is required, when testing of the product is required, or
            when a hold is required for production to wait for authorization to
            proceed.
          </p>
          <p>
            An ITP is integral to establishing a uniform inspection and testing
            scheme that all parties (inspectors, manufacturers, and auditors)
            can follow during production. The uniform performance of activities
            allows for quality events to be measurable.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a minimum, an ITP is typically developed for each
            pressure-carrying component of the pipeline system. The ITP should
            include as appropriate: testing frequency, acceptance criteria,
            calibration requirements, personnel qualification, reporting, and
            document retention. Additional information where applicable should
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>segregation of non-conforming material;</li>
            <li>re-testing provisions, retention of test specimens; and</li>
            <li>supplemental testing of similar materials.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="s5_4" class="text-primary">5.4 Manufacturing Traceability</h3>
          <p>
            Current industry standards do not require traceability of raw
            materials such as slabs, plates and welding consumables. Details and
            additional information concerning the specific material
            non-conformances listed above is lacking beyond identification of
            the heat numbers. Thermomechanical plate rolling practices necessary
            to achieve high strength base materials are not required to be
            traced to the mother plate. An improvement to the current standards
            and company specifications would be to include discrete plate
            tracking. Issues with wall thickness and grade may be resolved
            during the material receiving process if all plates from a specific
            mother plate can be identified. Similarly, issues of centerline
            segregation and variable properties within a given plate, as
            documented in pipe manufacturing, can be considered a risk in high
            strength component manufacturing<sup id="fn7-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>7</a

            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consideration should be given to recording the unique identification
            of each manufacturing component, raw material and/or consumable.
            Individual identifiers may be consolidated under a single identifier
            utilizing an appropriate tracking system. Quality control
            documentation such as heat treatment data, pressure test data, NDT
            results, test pieces, and mechanical and metallurgical test results
            should be traceable to the finished goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control of raw materials, consumables and finished goods throughout
            the manufacturing process is critical to identifying and segregating
            non-conforming materials. Additionally, traceability allows for the
            examination of similar items in the event that non-conformances are
            discovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of items for consideration in a tracking system include but
            are not limited to pipe joints, fittings, castings, forgings, plate,
            skelp, welding consumables, heat numbers, lot numbers, and component
            serial numbers. Manufacturing and testing processes that employ more
            than one station, equipment operator or multiple discrete pieces of
            equipment should provide traceability to the finished goods.
            Examples include welding stations, furnaces, facing machines,
            assembly lines, tensile testers, and/or inspection stations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of distributor supplied components, the traceability is
            further diminished. Distributors provide a valuable service in the
            overall supply chain. Individual fittings are often necessary on
            short notice for maintenance projects or smaller projects. In many
            cases, it is impractical to commission a manufacturing run for small
            quantities of specific specification. However, obtaining additional
            manufacturing data for stock distributor fittings would benefit the
            process of determining the suitability of the material. Industry
            standards can be improved to include traceable raw material, heat
            treatment, and testing data for those products not project specific.
            Additionally, the pipeline operator procurement best practices
            including a CMTR pre-purchase review, supplemental NDE, and robust
            mill pre-qualification can benefit the procurement process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The manufacturing traceability should be maintained after the piping
            or component is installed. Unique identifiers assigned to pipe and
            components and tied to geospatial locations and manufacturing
            traceability records facilitate the future location and assessment
            of any pipe or component that is related to possible performance
            deficiencies. The pipeline operator may employ tracking software
            that integrates with manufacturer systems and maintains product
            traceability from raw material through installed location.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_5" class="text-primary">5.5 Materials Inspection</h3>
          <p>
            Material inspection and testing requirements are specified in the
            MPS and ITP specific to the material being manufactured and the
            manufacturing process. All necessary witnessing, verification,
            testing, and documentation review shall be completed and accepted
            prior to the material or product being classified as finished goods
            and released to the project. Surveillance should be scheduled and
            implemented to provide comprehensive inspection of production.
            Processes that are observed are typically better controlled, and
            infrequent inspection may result in snap shots that are not
            representative of full production.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deviations or upset conditions during the manufacturing process can
            lead to the introduction of defects in the finished product or the
            loss of traceability. Expectations for production performance such
            as pieces per shift, tests completed, product delivered, or repairs
            should be established to provide for condition monitoring.
            Deviations from these metrics during the manufacturing process may
            indicate an upset condition warranting further investigation. Hold
            points may be established to enable the testing and/or witnessing
            concurrent with the manufacturing process.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_6" class="text-primary">5.6 Raw materials verification</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the interviews conducted with the pipeline operating
            companies, it was identified by one pipeline operator that there is
            little to no traceability of distributor sourced components relative
            to the steel or plate mills, unlike the traceability in place for
            line pipe. MTR reviews and post procurement chemical analysis
            suggest that lean alloying chemistries may be an issue that when
            combined with variable heat treatment practices result in
            substandard material properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other pipeline industry reviews have been conducted and the results
            documented. Chevron carried out review and testing of various
            flanges in response to recent incidents<sup id="fn8-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"

            >. Their analysis identified that chemical composition limits are
            too permissive in MSS&nbsp;SP-75 and incomplete within
            ASTM&nbsp;A694. When microalloyed High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA)
            steel is used, traditional heat treating processes such as quenching
            and tempering are misapplied. Quality safeguards within industry
            standards are insufficient to identify all potential issues, and the
            use of sample coupons and/or testing of starting material may not
            accurately represent the properties of finished products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Becht Engineering and Paulin Research Group (Becht) conducted burst
            tests of welding tees manufactured to ASME&nbsp;B16.9. Their testing
            indicated that fabrication techniques and acceptance criteria
            allowed by the standard can result in thinner sections of the tees
            which do not meet burst test requirements.<sup id="fn9-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>9</a
              ></sup
            >
            Becht postulated that it was likely that the current rules are
            allowing manufacturers searching for an economic advantage to use
            lower strength material that is easier to form and to use thinner
            pipe which is also easier to form. This practice may result in
            insufficient material in the crotch areas and a reduced margin for
            pressure containment capacity. Becht states that some manufacturers
            in certain cases are using 87.5&nbsp;percent of the nominal
            thickness as a minimum thickness criteria. This practice is
            generally compliant with B16.9 due to the perceived vagueness of the
            ‘mathematical analyses’ requirements of paragraph&nbsp;2.2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recommendations were submitted to the B16 committees, however the
            importance of raw material dimensional properties relative to other
            component manufacturing processes was not addressed. Case studies
            referenced above identified instances where elbows exhibited lower
            than specified wall thickness. Current standards do not provide for
            traceability to specific mother plates which limits the ability to
            identify and quarantine substandard plates prior to manufacturing of
            the component.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_7" class="text-primary">
            5.7 Manufacturing Procedure Qualification
          </h3>
          <p>
            Manufacturing procedures are often developed based on qualification
            testing. In many cases, trial products are manufactured and tested
            using a variety of base materials and processes. In this way, each
            manufacturer develops procedures that are specific to their plants,
            the installed equipment, and their raw material suppliers. This
            method results in plant specific processes. In the case of
            requirements for chemical composition and heat treatment, industry
            standard guidance in the form of maximum or minimum values are met,
            but the actual targets are in the manufacturer’s procedure.
            Deviations from any of the qualification production parameters such
            as furnace loading, furnace hold times, quench media temperature or
            agitation can result in substandard products even if the industry
            standard requirements are met. This effect is compounded if multiple
            deviations in production parameters occur. Chemical composition may
            create steels that are sensitive to small deviations in processing
            such as normalizing or tempering temperatures. Similarly, wall
            thickness deviations, furnace loading patterns, and furnace rack
            condition may affect furnace hold times. The cumulative effect of
            deviations should be addressed in the ITP which monitors specific
            processes to confirm compliance with the manufacturing procedure.
            Multiple deviations may trigger supplemental testing or production
            monitoring.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_8" class="text-primary">
            5.8 Inspection and Testing Enhancements
          </h3>
          <p>
            Pipeline operating companies who have experienced material issues
            identified inspection and testing improvement opportunities for both
            manufacturing facilities and distributors. Material testing is
            generally conducted using coupons which undergo similar forming
            operations and heat treatment. Coupons often consist of the same raw
            material (i.e. plate) welded or attached to a production fitting.
            This may take the form of a welding “run on/run off” tab in the case
            of formed and welded material. The following items may be considered
            for inclusion in company specifications and/or commercial agreements
            to ensure testing is representative of the finished products:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Increase lot testing frequencies to ensure test results are
              available for all heat treatment batches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Specify locations of test coupons for lot testing including the
              location within furnace loads.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct additional furnace uniformity testing to ensure adequate
              temperature settings and equipment calibration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct destructive tests of finished components to verify the
              accuracy of coupon tests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct hardness and metallographic testing to supplement lot
              testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restrict the use of retesting and reheat treatments without prior
              company approval.
            </li>
            <li>
              Require charts or records of all heat treatment temperature and
              hold times in final documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mandate traceability to clearly track each fitting from raw
              material to finished goods.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide for documentation of raw material, process parameters and
              test results of fittings intended for distributors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply furnace loading, support and stacking procedures including
              the use of racks or stands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply requirements and calculations for heat treatment hold times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply quench temperature limits, agitation, and process time
              requirements.

          <h3 id="s5_9" class="text-primary">5.9 Procurement</h3>
          <p>
            The current industry procurement protocols often rely on a pipeline
            operating company’s specifications to overcome gaps in industry
            standards. This creates an uneven playing field where pipeline
            operators with comprehensive specifications are placed in an
            uncompetitive position due to higher procurement costs. The opposing
            risk is that non-conforming materials are not promptly identified
            and allowed to be placed in operations.  Procurement of fabricated
            assembles (meter skids) or turn-key constructed facilities (pump
            stations) may involve an additional party purchasing fittings for
            inclusion in the assembly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the interviews conducted with the pipeline operating
            companies, it was identified by one pipeline operator that
            components are often procured through distributors based on a
            listing of pre-qualified manufacturers. The manufacturers are
            subject to removal should substandard or non-conforming materials be
            identified during the procurement acceptance and testing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Procurement policies and procedures including manufacturer
            pre-qualification and periodic review should be developed to ensure
            pipeline operator quality strategies are transferred to all parties
            in the supply chain.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_10" class="text-primary">5.10 Acceptance and testing</h3>
          <p>
            One pipeline operating company that was interviewed indicated that a
            pre- and post-purchase testing process has been initiated for
            distributor supplied components. MTRs are requested and reviewed
            against the pipeline operating company chemical specifications prior
            to issuance of the final purchase order. Prior to delivery to the
            job site, the pipeline operator visually inspects the component and
            conducts magnetic particle inspection (MPI) of the pipe ends and any
            suspect areas. Wall thickness is spot checked in addition to the
            checks initiated in areas identified by the visual inspection. The
            pipeline operating company does not allow substitutions of higher
            yield, lower wall thickness materials in part to avoid weldability
            issues in the field. The carbon equivalent (CE) value is reviewed at
            the MTR evaluation stage against pipeline operating company
            specifications and CSA and API standards.

          <p>
            Microalloyed high strength steels are very sensitive to changes in
            manufacturing processes such as thermomechanical rolling and heat
            treating. This sensitivity compounds small deviations in
            manufacturing process such as tempering temperature. To minimize the
            risk of substandard materials, the initial process qualification
            often referred to as First Article Inspection forms the basis for
            all subsequent manufacturing procedures and the Manufacturing
            Procedure Specification (MPS) when applicable.

            Chemical composition limits are too permissive in MSS&nbsp;SP-75 and
            incomplete within ASTM&nbsp;A694. When microalloyed High Strength
            Low Alloy (HSLA) steel is used, traditional heat treating processes
            such as quenching and tempering, can be misapplied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manufacturers in certain cases are using 87.5&nbsp;percent of the
            nominal thickness as a minimum thickness criteria. This practice is
            generally compliant with B16.9 due to the perceived vagueness of the
            ‘mathematical analyses’ requirements of paragraph&nbsp;2.2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables such as heat treatment and quenching temperatures, hold
            times, furnace load configurations, etc. should be sufficiently
            detailed to allow for quality control monitoring. Initial
            qualification testing should be rigorous and clearly define the
            resultant material properties as related to the product
            specification. Finally, the MPS and ITP should sufficiently define
            the process such that production inspection is efficiently and
            thoroughly conducted. Deviations from the process need to be quickly
            identified and supplemental testing utilized to define the impact. A
            robust system of traceability should allow for all materials
            affected by a process disruption to be identified and segregated to
            prevent their entry into the supply chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The failure of components to conform to standards and
            specifications, as investigated in this report, is a direct result
            of failures to control the manufacturing processes. These failures
            were not identified by the established ITP protocols, either during
            production monitoring or subsequent material acceptance testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enhancements to current industry standards are recommended to close
            the gaps identified between standards, manufacturing processes and
            the intended component performance (See
            <a href="#t2">Table&nbsp;2</a>). Pipeline operators and/or
            distributors should consider enhancing product specifications to
            provide more rigorous traceability, process monitoring and product
            testing.

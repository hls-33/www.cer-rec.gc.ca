            section&nbsp;12 of the NEB Act into the 9&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006
            ruptures of a liquid sulphur pipeline and has published the above
            referenced report. The report has made ten&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;findings
            as to the cause of the accident and factors contributing to it. The
            Board has also issued an Order to Spectra, made pursuant to
            subsection&nbsp;48(1.1) of the NEB Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            All companies should review the findings and corrective actions and
            make appropriate changes to their management systems and operations
            to avoid similar future accidents. Specifically, companies should
            note the findings and decisions with respect to the adequacy of
            surge protection installations and the availability of emergency
            power for operations of critical systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report is available on the Board's website, on the Safety page

            Plant damaged two electrical power generators and caused a loss of
            power to the sulphur pipeline's heat tracing system. Instrumentation
            readings for the sulphur pipeline were lost on 4&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006
            and a decision was made to shut down the pipeline. This allowed
            liquid sulphur to solidify within the pipeline. During re-melt
            procedures, expanding liquid sulphur and hydraulic shock developed
            internal pressures which caused stress in excess of the material
            tensile strength and ruptured the pipe at 2.3&nbsp;km and
            2.8&nbsp;km. In both occurrences, no injuries were sustained and the
            sulphur did not ignite. An approximate total of 2&nbsp;m&sup3; of
            molten sulphur was released from the pipeline and later recovered.

          </h3>
          <p>
            The sulphur pipeline is located near the town of Chetwynd in
            Northeastern British Columbia. The local geography is mountainous
            and the pipeline descends a steep slope approximately 5.5&nbsp;km
            long, experiencing a 490&nbsp;m elevation change. Appendix&nbsp;I
            illustrates the geographic location of the sulphur pipeline.
            Appendix&nbsp;II provides a schematic diagram of the sulphur
            pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sulphur pipeline was constructed in&nbsp;1994<sup>[1]</sup> for
            the purpose of transporting liquid sulphur from the Pine River Gas
            Plant (PRGP or Plant) to a pelletizing facility operated by an
            independent company near Hasler Flats. The pipeline system is
            comprised of 168.3&nbsp;mm (NPS&nbsp;6) diameter pipe and fittings
            constructed to the standard ASME&nbsp;B31.3<sup>[2]</sup>, above
            ground supports, multiple heat tracing systems, and thermal
            insulation. The pipe specifications are summarized in
            Table&nbsp;3-1.
          </p>
          <p class="small ">
            [1] Construction and operation of the Sulphur Pipeline was approved
            by Order&nbsp;XG-W5-28-93, dated June&nbsp;1993, pursuant to

            The Pine River Gas Plant operates on a self generating power system
            with 5 generators totaling 10.5&nbsp;MW of primary capacity. Units
            GE3401A and 3401B are 3&nbsp;MW generators driven by natural gas
            fired turbines. Units&nbsp;GE14.03 and&nbsp;14.04 are 1.5&nbsp;MW
            generators driven by natural gas fired reciprocating engines. Unit
            GE14.01 is a 1.5 MW generator driven by a steam turbine. One
            70&nbsp;kW emergency generator supplied power to emergency lighting
            and critical control systems. Surge arresters were in place on
            exposed overhead power lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sulphur pipeline transports sulphur in a liquid state maintained
            above the melting point of 115.2<sup>o</sup>C. Sulphur may expand in
            volume by 8.3% or more upon remelting (phase change from monoclinic
            solid to liquid). Properties of sulphur are detailed in
            Appendix&nbsp;III. At normal flow rates, sulphur in the pipeline
            stays at sufficiently high temperatures to reach the terminus
            without solidifying. The sulphur pipeline utilizes heat tracing,
            insulation, and other back up systems to prevent solidification at
            low flow rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three heat tracing systems provide heat to the sulphur pipeline. The
            length of the pipeline is heated by Skin Effect Current Tracing
            (SECT), which is powered by the Plant electrical generators. An
            illustration of the SECT heat tracing system is provided in
            Appendix&nbsp;IV. The SECT system provides inductive and resistive
            heat through a 33.4&nbsp;mm (NPS&nbsp;1) conduit joined to the
            pipeline by tack welds approximately every 300&nbsp;mm. A glycol
            jacket heating system is installed from the Plant to the beginning
            of the pipeline, approximately 25&nbsp;metres downstream of
            valve&nbsp;30ESDV002. A mineral insulated electric heat tracing
            system is installed at line block valves (LBVs), with the LBV&nbsp;1
            system powered by Plant electrical generators and LBV&nbsp;2 powered
            by BC Hydro.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pipeline is insulated by 76&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;inches) of pearlite
            covered by an additional 76&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;inches) of polyurethane
            foam. Pipe supports have greater thermal conductivity and are
            therefore locations with greater heat loss. Additional insulation is
            installed at these locations. When sulphur is flowing, variations in
            heat loss occur over the length of the pipeline, but do not affect
            operation. When sulphur is not flowing, areas that experience higher
            heat loss are at greater risk of solidification.
          </p>
          <p>
            A nitrogen injection skid is available to assist draining of the
            pipeline without introducing air. The nitrogen gas is electrically
            heated to prevent cooling and solidification of sulphur during the
            procedure. Power is supplied to the nitrogen skid by the Plant
            electrical generators.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sulphur pipeline is supported on piles above ground. Shoes are
            installed to accommodate lateral shifts. At specific locations, the
            pipeline is restrained to supports with anchors and tie-rods to
            withstand dynamic loads such as hydraulic shock. The pipeline is
            restrained as expansion joints to keep the pipe positioned on its
            pipe supports where it is installed on steep terrain.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s3_2"></a>3.2 Incident Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            On 3&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006 at 2136&nbsp;MDT, lightning struck the Pine
            River Gas Plant. Generation electrical protection devices, load
            shedding devices and system instability caused total loss of power.
            The surge in voltage damaged the two 1.5 MW generators driven by
            natural gas fired reciprocating engines, which were the only units
            capable of black-starting the plant. Attempts to restart the
            generators were unsuccessful. The Plant's Distributed Control System
            (DCS), which provides computerized monitoring and control, continued
            to operate on battery power.
          </p>
          <p>
            The loss of power at the Pine River Gas Plant rendered the sulphur
            pipeline heat tracing systems inoperable. The SECT and mineral
            insulated electric heat tracing at LBV (1.5&nbsp;km) were inoperable
            without electrical power from the Plant. With the Plant shut down,
            Sulphur production ceased.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 4&nbsp;July at 0113&nbsp;MDT, sulphur from storage was used to
            establish a 325&nbsp;tonnes/day minimum flow rate to prevent
            solidification of sulphur within the pipeline. At 1020&nbsp;MDT
            battery power for the DCS had been completely consumed. Operators
            were unable to accurately monitor the pipeline without the DCS and
            stopped flow from storage. Without electrical power, the nitrogen
            injection skid was not available to support draining the pipeline,
            and the pipeline shut-in valves were closed. By 1440&nbsp;MDT, the
            sulphur remaining in the pipeline began to solidify.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 6&nbsp;July, power was restored to the Pine River Gas Plant and
            the DCS. Remelt procedures commenced at approximately 1900&nbsp;MDT
            and the sulphur pipeline's SECT heat tracing system was energized.
            The remelt procedure required a controlled temperature increase over
            a period of up to 70&nbsp;hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 8&nbsp;July at 2108&nbsp;MDT, a leak was observed at LBV&nbsp;2
            (3.2&nbsp;km) and operators were dispatched to conduct repairs. A
            short time later, on 9&nbsp;July at 0200&nbsp;MDT, an operator at
            3.2&nbsp;km heard a single loud explosion. At 0550&nbsp;MDT a
            rupture was identified at 2.8&nbsp;km and at&nbsp;0556 the remelt
            procedure was suspended. The Transportation Safety Board<sup
              >[5]</sup
            >
            (TSB) was notified by telephone on 9&nbsp;July at 1105&nbsp;MDT and
            the NEB was subsequently notified by telephone at approximately
            1140&nbsp;MDT.

          <p>
            On 13&nbsp;July, staff from the NEB and TSB attended the site of the
            incident. After a preliminary assessment of the facts surrounding
            this incident, the TSB determined that it would not conduct an
            investigation. The NEB therefore continued with a full investigation
            pursuant to the NEB Act.

            The sulphur pipeline sustained ruptures at 2.3&nbsp;km and
            2.8&nbsp;km, as well as damaged anchors and displacement of the pipe
            from its supports at 1.5&nbsp;km, 2.3&nbsp;km, and 2.8&nbsp;km. The
            condition of the pipe was examined by removing insulation at piles
            along the pipeline. Measurements confirmed the pipeline had expanded
            in diameter by as much as 3.8% near the 2.3&nbsp;km rupture and 5.7%
            downstream of the 2.8&nbsp;km rupture<sup>[6]</sup>. The rupture at
            2.3&nbsp;km occurred on the inside radius of the last 90&nbsp;degree
            elbow of an expansion joint. The anchors were damaged and the pipe
            was completely displaced from its supports. The rupture at
            2.8&nbsp;km occurred on a straight section of pipe located on a
            slope. Pipe at this location was displaced on its supports.

            In both occurrences, no injuries were sustained and the sulphur did
            not ignite. An approximate total of 2&nbsp;m&sup3; of molten sulphur
            was released from the pipeline and later recovered.

          <h4><a id="s3_3_1"></a>3.3.1 Elbow Failure at&nbsp;2.3&nbsp;km</h4>
          <p>
            The failure of the elbow at 2.3&nbsp;km was caused by internal
            pressure which developed stress in excess of the ultimate tensile
            strength of the fitting. High stress caused expansion of the pipe
            diameter and thinning of the pipe walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspection of adjacent straight sections of pipe indicated the pipe
            diameter was 1.91&nbsp;mm to 5.46&nbsp;mm (0.075 to
            0.215&nbsp;inches) oversize. Pipe wall thickness measured
            7.11&nbsp;mm (0.280&nbsp;inches), 35% less than the specified wall
            thickness of 10.97&nbsp;mm (0.432&nbsp;inches).
          </p>
          <p>
            The hardness of the elbow material adjacent to the fracture was
            measured between 226&nbsp;HV and 298&nbsp;HV. The hardness of a
            typical cross section measured 190&nbsp;HB (91&nbsp;HRB), which is
            lower than the 197&nbsp;HB maximum specified in
            ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;234.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tensile properties were determined by cutting and straightening a
            piece of the elbow. The yield strength could not be reliably
            determined because of the strain effects of straightening, however
            the specimen met the ultimate tensile strength and elongation
            specified by ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;234. Appendix&nbsp;V details the
            results of tests performed on the elbow.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s3_3_2"></a>3.3.2 Pipe Body Failure at 2.8&nbsp;km</h4>
          <p>
            The failure at 2.8&nbsp;km was caused by internal pressure which
            developed stress in excess of the ultimate tensile strength of the
            pipe. High stresses expanded the pipe diameter and caused thinning
            of the pipe walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspection of adjacent straight sections of pipe indicated the pipe
            diameter was 4.98&nbsp;mm to 9.53&nbsp;mm (0.196 to
            0.375&nbsp;inches) oversize. Pipe wall thickness measured
            7.72&nbsp;mm to 10.03&nbsp;mm (0.304 to 0.395&nbsp;inches), 9% to
            30% less than the specified wall thickness of 10.97&nbsp;mm
            (0.432&nbsp;inches).
          </p>
          <p>
            The fracture initiated at a crack located in the toe of a tack weld
            joining the SECT conduit to the pipe. A cross section at this
            location revealed secondary cracking in the root of the tack weld.
            Magnetic particle inspection revealed crack indications at&nbsp;7 of
            10&nbsp;adjacent tack welds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hardness adjacent to the fracture was measured between 241&nbsp;HV
            and 298&nbsp;HV; while hardness in the HAZ and tack weld were
            measured between 343&nbsp;HV and 364&nbsp;HV. The hardness of a
            typical cross section measured 190&nbsp;HB (92&nbsp;HRB). The
            standard ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;106 does not specify a maximum hardness,
            but for comparison the hardness is less than the maximum specified
            by ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;234.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tensile test results met the requirements of ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;106.
            These results and the Charpy V-Notch impact energy values are
            summarized in Appendix&nbsp;V.

          <p>
            Since commissioning in&nbsp;1994, the sulphur pipeline has
            experienced a number of incidents including a series of fires as a
            result of sulphur leaks in&nbsp;2000 and&nbsp;2001. In
            March&nbsp;2001, the Board appointed an investigative panel and
            eventually ordered all work on the pipeline to be
            stopped<sup>[11]</sup>. An oral hearing<sup>[12]</sup> was convened
            in Chetwynd British Columbia between&nbsp;9 and
            12&nbsp;April&nbsp;2001.

          <p>
            In its Reasons for Decision, dated October&nbsp;2001, the Board
            found the sulphur pipeline did not operate as expected due to a
            combination of design problems, unanticipated operating conditions,
            and inadequate maintenance and operational procedures. To address
            these operational concerns, Spectra drafted and implemented a
            Comprehensive Plan and was granted conditional approval to open the
            sulphur pipeline<sup>[13]</sup>.

          </p>
          <p>
            One condition of approval required Spectra to advise within one week
            of restarting the pipeline that all work necessary to upgrade the
            pipeline supports to accommodate hydraulic shock had been complete.
            The condition was later amended<sup>[14]</sup> to allow Spectra to
            operate the pipeline but not undertake any remelting activities
            until the upgrades were complete. All work necessary to upgrade the
            pipeline supports to withstand a major hydraulic shock had been
            undertaken by September&nbsp;2002.

            <a id="s4_1_1"></a>4.1.1 Findings as to Cause and Contributing
            Factors
          </h4>
          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;1.</strong> The total loss of power at the Pine
            River Gas Plant was caused by a lightning strike within 2&nbsp;km of
            the Plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 2136&nbsp;MDT on 3&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006, the Pine River Gas Plant
            experienced a total loss of power. Using Vaisala Fault Finder<sup
              >&reg;</sup
            >
            software, Spectra confirmed that lightning struck the plant, within
            a 1&nbsp;km radius range of error, at the time of power loss.
          </p>
          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;2.</strong> Inadequate surge protection and
            lack of redundant or emergency power to black-start the Plant were
            factors contributing to the total loss of power at the Pine River
            Gas Plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial total loss of power was caused by a combination of
            inadequate surge protection, activation of trip devices on the
            reciprocating generators, and load shedding device activation. The
            plant subsequently could not be restarted due to the failure of the
            reciprocating generators and lack of alternate emergency power to
            black-start the plant. At the time of the incident the surge
            arresters were only installed at overhead powerlines. The Plant was
            susceptible to power surges in the unlikely event of a direct
            lightning strike. Generating units GE14.03 and 14.04 (driven by
            natural gas fired reciprocating engines) were to be used to
            black-start the Plant in the event of total power loss. After the
            lightning strike, these units could be started, however they
            sustained damages that prevented energizing the main bus<sup
              >[15]</sup
            >
            and power could not be restored to the Plant. Further, the emergency
            generator only provided power to emergency lighting and critical
            systems.

          <p>
            Spectra has since upgraded the electrical system with greater surge
            protection and added redundancy for emergency power generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            High capacity surge arresters were added at each generator and the
            main bus. Distribution type surge arresters on overhead power line
            systems were replaced with higher capacity station type surge
            arresters.
          </p>
          <p>
            A dedicated 600&nbsp;kW emergency generator was added to the
            electrical system. The emergency generator provides emergency power
            for black-start of GE3401-A and 3401-B generators, for the sulphur
            pipeline nitrogen injection skid, and for the Train 3 battery
            chargers that support critical systems.

            have adequate surge protection and emergency power for black-start
            capabilities. This will prevent similar periods of prolonged loss of
            power and unforeseen upset operating conditions which may occur as a
            result.

            Factors
          </h4>
          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;3.</strong> The root cause of solidification of
            sulphur within the pipeline was inadequate planning for prolonged
            total loss of power.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scenario of prolonged total loss of power was not adequately
            planned for in the design of the nitrogen injection skid, shutdown
            procedures, and operating procedures. The operation of the
            electrically heated nitrogen injection skid was dependant upon full
            restoration of power. Sulphur pipeline shutdown procedures relied
            upon the operability of the nitrogen injection skid. Sulphur
            pipeline operating procedures did not contemplate operation without
            monitoring capabilities from the DCS. Without the ability to monitor
            the pipeline, and a lack of prepared contingency in such a scenario,
            operators shut-in the sulphur pipeline. With electrically powered
            heat tracing inoperable the sulphur began to solidify.
          </p>
          <div class="well well-sm col-md-12 ">
            <p>
              <strong>Finding&nbsp;4.</strong> Factors contributing to
              solidification of sulphur and the formation of sulphur plugs
              include:
            </p>
            <div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
              <p>
                a) The inability to drain the pipeline.<br />
                b) The inability to continue operation after loss of power to
                the DCS.<br />
                c) Inoperable electrically powered heat tracing.<br />
                d) Higher heat loss at pipeline supports, pull-boxes and
                junction boxes, and other discontinuities.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            As similarly described in relation to Finding&nbsp;3, the inability
            to drain the sulphur pipeline, due to a lack of emergency power
            supply, was a contributing factor in the series of events that led
            to solidification of sulphur within the pipeline. Additionally,
            since operators could not maintain operation without the DCS, the
            decision to shut in the sulphur pipeline was also a contributing
            factor. As well, the electrically powered heat tracing was
            inoperable and unable to prevent solidification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pipeline supports, pull-boxes and junction boxes, and other
            discontinuities contributed to solidification of sulphur and the
            formation of solid sulphur plugs because these locations have higher
            thermal conductivity or varying insulation. The coincidence of
            sulphur plugs at these locations was confirmed by radiographic
            examination after the 9&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006 ruptures and by thermal
            imaging.

          <h4><a id="s4_2_2"></a>4.2.2 Corrective Actions Taken By Spectra</h4>
          <p>
            A dedicated 600&nbsp;kW emergency generator has been installed by
            Spectra since the incident which will provide power for the nitrogen
            injection skid, for black-starting one of the site's primary jet
            generators, and for plant battery charger supply, in addition to
            other emergency power system items.

            The procedure for a total power outage<sup>[16]</sup> was revised to
            provide clear and concise instructions for the sulphur pipeline.
            Specifically, a minimum flow rate of 1000&nbsp;tons/day is to be
            established from storage and if power is not restored within two
            hours, or storage is low, the pipeline is to be drained and purged.

            The Board is of the view that the corrective actions taken by
            Spectra have greatly reduced the risk of solidification of sulphur
            within the pipeline in the event of a total power loss. The Board
            has no additional decisions to make in this respect.

            <a id="s4_3_1"></a>4.3.1 Findings as to Cause and Contributing
            Factors
          </h4>
          <p>
            Overpressure was caused by two mechanisms, or a combination thereof:
            expansion of sulphur during phase change from solid to liquid and/or
            hydraulic shock. The overpressure mechanisms and their relevance to
            failure at 2.3&nbsp;km and 2.8&nbsp;km are explored further below.
          </p>
          <p>
            When liquid sulphur solidifies it contracts and effectively packs
            the pipeline. Upon remelting, the packed sulphur expands during the
            phase change and creates extreme localized pressures. Hydraulic
            shock is caused when a slug of solid sulphur releases and creates
            out-of-balance forces and pressure rarefaction<sup>[17]</sup>, or
            when liquid sulphur travels through a void in the pipeline and hits
            an obstruction such as a plug of solid sulphur, a turn in an
            expansion joint, or a closed valve.

          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;5.</strong> The overpressure at 2.8&nbsp;km was
            likely caused by expansion of sulphur during phase change from solid
            to liquid between plugs of sulphur.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overpressure at 2.8&nbsp;km was likely caused by expansion of
            sulphur during phase change from solid to liquid between plugs of
            solid sulphur. The pipe experienced significant wall thinning
            adjacent to the SECT conduit, where expansion from phase change
            would be greatest. The effects of overpressure by expansion of
            sulphur during phase change are cumulative with each successive
            overpressure. Expansion of the pipe can occur each time the pipeline
            is subjected to the remelt procedure. Lab results from examination
            of the failure at 2.8&nbsp;km showed no evidence of progressive
            failure; however, the pipe diameters at locations along the line
            expanded by up to 7% and are now at greater risk of cumulative
            effects.
          </p>
          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;6.</strong> The overpressure at 2.3&nbsp;km may
            have been caused by pressure or rarefaction wave, or hydraulic
            shock, resulting from the 2.8&nbsp;km rupture in combination with
            the expansion effects of melting sulphur.
          </p>
          <p>
            As reflected in finding&nbsp;6, the cause of overpressure at
            2.3&nbsp;km is not entirely certain. Thinning of the elbow wall
            adjacent to the failure may be indicative of localized overpressure
            associated with expansion of sulphur during phase change. However,
            this bulging did not occur adjacent to the SECT conduit. Spectra has
            suggested that hydraulic shock, as a result of out-of-balance forces
            and pressure rarefaction created by the 2.8&nbsp;km rupture, may
            have contributed to overpressure. This would explain the
            uphill/upstream displacement of the expansion joint at the
            2.3&nbsp;km rupture site.
          </p>
          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;7.</strong> The root cause of overpressure was
            an inadequate remelt procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the remelt procedure<sup>[18]</sup> was to return the
            sulphur pipeline to service after it had been inoperative for
            several days and the sulphur was totally or partially solidified.
            The procedure called for a series of controlled temperature
            increases and hold periods over a span of up to 70&nbsp;hours.

          </p>
          <p>
            In practice however, when the remelt procedure was initiated upon
            restoration of power, the controlled temperature increases and hold
            periods could not be achieved (the time-temperature profile is
            provided in Appendix&nbsp;VI). The uneven heating observed during
            the remelt procedure may have been a result of initiating the
            procedure when: temperatures varied greatly throughout the pipeline
            (between 52<sup>o</sup>C and 163<sup>o</sup>C); sulphur in the
            pipeline was at varying degrees of solidification; sulphur plugs and
            voids were present; there were heat sinks at discontinuities in the
            pipeline; or any combination thereof. Ultimately, the remelt
            procedure was unsuccessful and resulted in uneven temperatures and
            overpressure conditions that eventually ruptured the sulphur
            pipeline.

          <p>
            The procedure for remelting the sulphur pipeline was extensively
            revised<sup>[19]</sup>. The procedure now has a pre-condition for
            remelting, which is to ensure complete solidification of sulphur
            remaining in the pipeline by maintaining uniform temperatures below
            37.8<sup>o</sup>C (100<sup>o</sup>F) for a 24&nbsp;hour period. The
            new remelt methodology requires rapid heating of the heat tracing
            systems, which will melt a channel of sulphur immediately next to
            the heat tracing. This minimizes the volume of sulphur that will
            undergo phase change and expand. The sulphur pipeline is also to be
            melted in 7&nbsp;pre-planned sections. The procedure identifies
            large commitments of time, resources, equipment, and monitoring,
            required to remelt the pipeline, as well as the need for every
            remelt to be analyzed by a team prior to execution.

            In March of&nbsp;2007, while the new procedure was being used to
            remelt the sulphur pipeline, the pipeline did not remelt uniformly
            and experienced hydraulic shock<sup>[20]</sup>. As a result, an
            anchor and tie-rod assembly was damaged but the pipe did not
            rupture. Subsequently, a full remelt was achieved in April
            of&nbsp;2007 without further damage.

          <p>
            The Board has no additional decisions to make in this respect. The
            Board acknowledges that performing a remelt without occurrence of
            hydraulic shock is difficult, if not impossible to achieve.
            Extensive research and field trials by Spectra have resulted in a
            more effective remelt procedure. The Board also notes that other
            corrective actions taken as a result of this incident have greatly
            reduced the probability of sulphur solidifying within the pipeline,
            and therefore reduced the probability of having to perform a remelt
            procedure. Nonetheless, should the sulphur pipeline require a remelt
            again in the future, Spectra should undertake careful analysis and
            perform the remelt with great diligence.

          </h4>
          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;8.</strong> The immediate cause of failure at
            both the 2.3&nbsp;km elbow failure and the 2.8km pipe failure was
            stress exceeding the tensile strength of the material.
          </p>
          <p>
            The total loss of power, solidification of sulphur in the pipeline,
            and overpressure upon remelting, eventually led to ruptures at
            2.3&nbsp;km and 2.8&nbsp;km on the sulphur pipeline. Laboratory
            examination of the failed material at both locations revealed
            acceptable material properties and the cause of failure was
            determined to be stress exceeding the tensile strength of the
            material.
          </p>
          <p class="well well-sm ">
            <strong>Finding&nbsp;9.</strong> A crack in the heat affected zone
            of the weld joining the SECT conduit to the pipe was a contributing
            factor of the rupture at 2.8&nbsp;km.
          </p>
          <p>
            A crack in the toe of the weld joining the SECT conduit to the pipe
            at 2.8&nbsp;km contributed to the failure only by providing a site
            for the rupture to initiate. The cause of the crack which
            contributed to failure at 2.8&nbsp;km was investigated further.
            Spectra submitted to the Board a sample quality control (QC) package
            for joining of the SECT conduit to the pipe during fabrication. The
            QC package included welding procedure specifications, welder
            qualification, and non-destructive examination records that included
            100% NDE of tack welds by magnetic particle inspection. The sample
            record demonstrated effective NDE which identified linear crack
            indications and resulted in rejection and repair of welds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investigation of the cut-out from the pipe body failure at
            2.3&nbsp;km by Acuren revealed significantly higher hardness in the
            heat affected zone (HAZ) than in adjacent material, additional
            cracks at&nbsp;7 of 10&nbsp;adjacent tack welds detected by magnetic
            particle inspection, and a secondary crack in the root of the tack
            weld was revealed by cross-section of the failure surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            A number of conclusions can be drawn from these observations. The
            higher hardness measured in the HAZ than in adjacent material would
            suggest that hardness was pre-existing and a result of the welding
            process. Material with higher hardness could have provided stress
            concentration and a site for crack initiation. Also, since cracks
            in&nbsp;7 of the 10&nbsp;adjacent tack welds were detected by
            magnetic particle inspection and the QC process was demonstrated to
            be effective, it is possible that the cracks initiated some time
            after fabrication or during overpressure at the time of the remelt.
            What caused initiation of the secondary crack in the root of the
            tack weld is less certain, but highlights the need for strict
            adherence to the welding procedure specification to reproduce welds
            free of defects.

            Spectra has since performed a series of measurements to determine
            the degree of expansion along the sulphur pipeline. As well, Spectra
            performed a hydrostatic pressure test and compiled a brief
            qualitative risk assessment<sup>[21]</sup> to assess the integrity
            of the sulphur pipeline as it relates to&nbsp;MOP.

          <p>
            The results of measurements along the sulphur pipeline are compiled
            in two plots, provided in Appendix&nbsp;VII. Measurements of the
            outside diameter were plotted against distance in Figure&nbsp;VII-1,
            with the range of specification ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;106 for comparison.
            Expansion proved to be greatest in locations near the 2.3&nbsp;km
            and 2.8&nbsp;km ruptures and exceeded the range of the
            specification. Measurements of the wall thickness were also plotted
            against distance in Figure&nbsp;VII-2, with minimum and nominal wall
            thickness of specification ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;106 for comparison. All
            wall thickness measurements were greater than the minimum specified
            by ASTM&nbsp;A&nbsp;106.

          <p>
            On 17 and 18&nbsp;April&nbsp;2007, the sulphur pipeline was subject
            to a hydrostatic pressure test in accordance with ASME&nbsp;B31.3,
            CSA&nbsp;Z662, and Spectra's internal specifications. The test was
            deemed successful upon completion of an 8 hour strength test and a 4
            hour leak test. Pressure was maintained between the
            21&nbsp;375&nbsp;kPa (3100&nbsp;psi, or 2.02&nbsp;x&nbsp;MOP)
            minimum and the 22&nbsp;754&nbsp;kPa (3300&nbsp;psi, or

          </p>
          <p>
            The strength test achieved a minimum pressure of
            21&nbsp;526&nbsp;kPa (3122&nbsp;psi, or 2.03&nbsp;MOP). In terms of
            stress, the test produced a minimum hoop stress of 165&nbsp;MPa or
            69% SMYS. In comparison, the pipeline design pressure of
            10&nbsp;584&nbsp;kPa produces a hoop stress of 81&nbsp;MPa
            (34%&nbsp;SMYS).
          </p>
          <p>
            The risk assessment included integrity threats such as pipe defects,
            corrosion, geotechnical or third party, and operational. Spectra
            determined pre-existing or newly initiated cracking and hardness
            associated with the tack weld were not a threat to long term
            integrity. Spectra submitted that significant thinning and bulging
            from stress beyond the yield strength, and the high failure stress,
            were evidence that cracks and hardness have not degraded the
            original design of the pipeline. Further, the hydrostatic test
            indicated that all possible defects that remain survived the maximum
            operating pressure and safety factor of 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spectra determined the threat of internal corrosion was highly
            unlikely, however it is mitigated by corrosion monitoring units,
            which are monitored quarterly, and ultrasonic testing points.
          </p>
          <p>
            To mitigate threats concerning geotechnical issues or third party
            damage, Spectra conducts routine ground patrols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spectra determined operational upset to be the greatest risk to
            integrity of the sulphur pipeline. Operational upset refers to
            conditions outside of normal operation that could lead to
            solidification of sulphur in the pipeline, performing of remelt
            procedures, and hydraulic shock. To mitigate against these threats,
            Spectra made extensive revisions to operating procedures and
            increased protection and redundancy of electrical systems. In the
            event of serious operational upset, Spectra has committed to
            development of a specific testing program to determine the
            suitability of the pipeline for continued service, similar to
            actions taken prior to the April&nbsp;2007 return to service.

            <strong>Finding&nbsp;10.</strong> Failure of anchors and tie-rods
            was caused by out-of-balance forces associated with rupture and, or,
            hydraulic shock.

          <p>
            Failure of anchor and tie-rod assemblies during the
            9&nbsp;July&nbsp;2006 rupture was caused by out-of-balance forces
            associated with rupture and, or, hydraulic shock. Anchor and tie-rod
            assemblies were not designed to withstand the maximum out-of-balance
            forces associated with a pipeline rupture; they were designed to
            only withstand hydraulic hammer forces anticipated during
            operation<sup>[23]</sup>. The tie-rod assemblies were designed to
            withstand a maximum horizontal load of 65&nbsp;tonnes and the
            anchors were designed to withstand 5&nbsp;tonnes; however a review
            performed by Spectra determined the pipeline rupture could result in
            out-of-balance forces equal to 100&nbsp;tonnes<sup>[24]</sup>.

          <p>
            Failure of anchor and tie-rod assemblies during the March&nbsp;2007
            remelt was caused by hydraulic shock. During the hydraulic shock
            event, anchor and tie-rod assemblies sustained damage, however the
            pipeline did not rupture.

          <p>
            Spectra repaired all damaged anchors, tie-rods, supports and shoes
            prior to returning the sulphur pipeline to service. Spectra and its
            consultants reviewed design of anchor and tie-rod assemblies and
            determined that the design is acceptable for foreseeable operational
            dynamic events related to normal operation.

            Future Accidents
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Board has no additional decisions to make in this respect. The
            purpose of the anchors and tie-rods is to balance restraint of the
            pipeline with the flexibility to absorb forces associated with
            hydraulic shock. In the interest of maintaining that balance, the
            Board accepts Spectra's determination that the design does not need
            revision at this time.

            A summary of the findings as to the causes of the accident and
            factors contributing to it may be found in Appendix&nbsp;VIII. The
            Board is satisfied that causes and contributing factors have been
            appropriately identified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spectra has determined the greatest risk to integrity of the sulphur
            pipeline is operational upset. Spectra has made appropriate changes
            to procedures, equipment, and systems to mitigate these risks. In
            its current state, the sulphur pipeline is safe for normal
            operation. The Board has made two&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;decisions
            (summarized in Appendix&nbsp;IX) to further mitigate and minimize
            any remaining risks. Pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;12(1.1)(<em>c</em>)
            and subsection&nbsp;48(1.1) of the NEB Act, these decisions have
            been incorporated as conditions in Order SC-W102-01-2009
            (Appendix&nbsp;X).

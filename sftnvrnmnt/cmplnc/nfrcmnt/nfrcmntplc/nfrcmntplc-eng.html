            its primary concern. The CER reports to Parliament through the
            Minister of Natural&nbsp;Resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through its safety and environmental oversight mandate, the CER
            regulates:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the construction, operation, and abandonment of pipelines that
              cross international borders or provincial boundaries, as well as
              the related pipeline tolls and tariffs
            </li>
            <li>
              the construction and operation of international power lines and
              designated inter-provincial power lines
            </li>
            <li>
              the construction and operation of offshore renewable energy
              project and offshore power lines
            </li>
            <li>
              exports of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas, refined
              petroleum products, and electricity
            </li>
            <li>
              oil and gas exploration and production activities in specified
              areas that are not regulated under joint federal/provincial
              accords
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            CER inspection officers will verify and enforce compliance with
            regulatory requirements during all phases of a project, from
            application to construction, operation and maintenance, as well
            during temporary or permanent suspensions of a pipeline such as
            deactivation, decommissioning and abandonment. The CER also
            investigates matters of alleged non-compliance as a result of
            complaints, reports of high-risk activity or&nbsp;incidents.

          <h2 id="s2">Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            This policy document describes the CER’s approach to enforcing
            regulatory requirements under its mandate. This approach is based on
            the principle of a compliance and enforcement continuum, which
            includes ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and
            escalating matters of non-compliance for appropriate action
            when&nbsp;required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where non-compliance occurs, the CER will take necessary compliance
            and enforcement action to bring companies back into compliance,
            and/or deter any future non-compliance based on a graduated
            enforcement model. This document is also intended to provide
            guidance to CER staff, industry and the public on guiding
            principles, processes and tools supporting all CER enforcement
            actions.

          <h2 id="s3">Scope</h2>
          <p>
            Most of the CER’s responsibilities are set out in the Canadian
            Energy Regulator Act, Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA), and
            the Oil Gas and Operations Act (OGOA)<sup id="fn1-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a
              ></sup
            >, as well as their associated regulations. The scope of this
            document applies to the administration and enforcement of these Acts
            and regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) designates officers under the Acts
            to conduct compliance verification activities to ensure the safety
            of Canadians and protection of the environment, and in the case of
            the COGOA and the OGOA, on the conservation of resources. The CER
            primarily regulates pipeline companies that hold a regulatory
            authorization<sup id="fn2-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"

            from the&nbsp;Commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although some CER staff have delegated responsibilities under the
            Canada Labour Code (CLC), Part&nbsp;II, for the occupational health
            and safety of pipeline company field staff and contractors, this
            policy does not apply to enforcement taken under the CLC<sup

          <h2 id="s4">Guiding Principles</h2>
          <p>
            The CER applies the following guiding principles in implementing
            compliance and enforcement activities under its mandate:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              In order to prevent harm to people and the environment, the CER
              will use the most appropriate tool(s) available to obtain/promote
              compliance with regulatory requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              The CER implements a compliance and enforcement continuum to
              address non-compliance(s), which includes escalating matters of
              non-compliance for appropriate action when required.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where non-compliance occurs, the necessary compliance and
              enforcement actions will be used to bring companies back into
              compliance, and/or deter any future non-compliance.
            </li>
            <li>
              CER inspection officers will administer the Acts and regulations
              under its mandate in a manner that is fair, predictable and
              consistent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meeting the federal government’s direction for transparency, the
              CER makes information on its compliance and enforcement activities
              available to the public.

          <h2 id="s6">The Enforcement Framework</h2>
          <p>
            CER inspection officers verify compliance with legislation,
            regulations, and a variety of regulatory instruments throughout the
            lifecycle of a pipeline and/or project. This section provides an
            overview of how they implement various levels of regulatory action
            to correct non-compliances based on a continuum of compliance and
            enforcement activities.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Compliance verification</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Regulator conducts compliance activities to verify that
            regulated companies and third parties are complying with the Acts
            and regulations under its mandate, as well as the conditions of
            their certificate, order or permit and commitments made during
            project&nbsp;applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In doing so, the Regulator will undertake compliance verification
            through on-site inspections, audits, compliance meetings with
            regulated companies, and review of relevant documentation.
            Compliance is achieved when legal requirements are met and companies
            fulfill the expectations set by the Regulator.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
          <p>
            When non-compliances are observed, the NEB will follow up to correct
            the situation and ensure compliance is achieved. Enforcement is
            undertaken to promote compliance with the various Acts and related
            regulations. Enforcement is also a consequence to a non-compliance
            in order to deter future non-compliance and prevent harm.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_1">The Enforcement Toolkit</h3>
          <p>
            Should a person or company not comply with regulatory requirements,
            the Regulator may take compliance and enforcement actions. The CER
            has a variety of tools available to ensure compliance and avoid
            repeated occurrences of non-compliances. CER’s compliance and
            enforcement tools are not mutually exclusive (except for AMPs and
            prosecution<sup id="-fra-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#-fra"
                ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>4</a
              ></sup
            >), and more than a single tool may be employed to obtain or promote
            compliance, deter future non-compliance or to prevent harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following compliance and enforcement tools are available in the
            CER’s toolkit:
          </p>
          <h4 id="s6_1_a" class="mrgn-lft-md">
            a) Corrected Non-Compliance (CNC) and Notice of Non-Compliance (NNC)
          </h4>
          <p>
            A CNC and NNC are tools issued by an inspection officer to an
            CER-regulated company, individual, or third party when a
            non-compliance is observed during a compliance verification
            activity.
          </p>
          These tools are meant to resolve compliance issues with a company. If
          issues of non-compliance are corrected during the course of the
          inspection activity, and addressed to the officer’s satisfaction at
          the time of the inspection close out meeting, this will be documented
          in the inspection report as a CNC. If more time is required to address
          non-compliance(s), an inspection officer determines an effective
          corrective action and due date with an NNC pursuant to s.&nbsp;108 of
          the CER Act.
          <h4 id="s6_1_b" class="mrgn-lft-md">b) Inspection Officer Order</h4>
          <p>
            A CER or COGOA/OGOA Officer, on reasonable grounds, may issue an
            order under certain conditions specified in the Acts. An order is a
            statutory enforcement tool issued pursuant to section&nbsp;109 of
            the CER Act, subsection&nbsp;58(1) of COGOA or
            subsection&nbsp;110(1) of OGOA.
          </p>
          <p>
            The officer order will be used to ensure that necessary action is
            taken to rectify the situation within a timeframe specified by the
            officer. The order may require immediate suspension of work or
            cessation of the operation/activity, and/or require special measures
            or terms to be undertaken to address the non-compliance or hazard.
            An order will always be given in writing, but if circumstances
            warrant, an order may first be issued verbally. If an officer issues
            an order under the CER Act, s/he must report it back to the
            Commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the officer is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the
            order have been met, or that the situation has been remedied, he/she
            will inform the company, either verbally or in writing, that any
            suspended work or ceased operation/activity may resume.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orders issued by officers under COGOA and OGOA expire 72&nbsp;hours
            after they have been issued, unless they are confirmed by order of
            the Chief Safety Officer or Chief Conservation Officer, as the case

          <p>
            A recipient of an officer order may request a review by the
            Commission, pursuant to section&nbsp;71 of the CER Act,
            subsection&nbsp;58(5) of COGOA or subsection&nbsp;110(5) of OGOA.
            The request for review does not stay the order, and that means that
            the suspension of work or conditions of the order must be met until
            the Commission decides otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances, additional enforcement measures may also be
            used subsequent to the order being issued to deter future
            non-compliance. Failure to comply with an officer order is a
            punishable offence and can lead to an escalation of enforcement
            responses.

          <p id="s6_1_c"><strong>c) Warning Letter (WL)</strong></p>
          <p>
            A Warning Letter (WL) is a non-statutory administrative enforcement
            tool intended to elevate compliance matters to the attention of
            senior company officials (typically, the designated Accountable
            Officer) or third parties in order to generate the necessary action
            to return to compliance if the non-compliance has not been
            addressed. If the matter has already been addressed, a WL will be
            used to inform recipients of the seriousness of the issue, and of
            possible escalation of further action should the non-compliance
            re-occur.

            d) Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)
          </h4>
          <p>
            An Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP) is a statutory financial
            penalty imposed on individuals or persons other than an individual
            (e.g. companies) in response to a contravention of, or failure to
            comply with, specified provisions in the CER Act and COGOA, and
            their associated regulations. All potential violations are listed in
            the Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations under the CER Act
            and COGOA. An&nbsp;AMP can be used instead of, or in conjunction
            with, other enforcement tools depending on the circumstances that
            lead to the non-compliance and the nature/severity of
            the&nbsp;violation.
          </p>
          <p>
            AMPs will be used when compliance has not been obtained using other
            compliance and/or enforcement tools, harm is caused or is likely to
            be caused by the non-compliance, or in any other situation where it
            is deemed the best way to promote compliance by deterring future
            non-compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the Acts, the CEO has designated an AMP Officer to issue
            notices of violation, which is the form used to issue the AMP.
          </p>
          <p>
            The recipient of a Notice of Violation has the right to have either
            the facts of the violation, or the amount of the penalty, or both,
            reviewed under section&nbsp;125 of the CER Act or section&nbsp;71.2
            of COGOA. If a review is requested within the specified timeframe, a
            Panel is appointed to conduct the review.

          <p>
            If other enforcement tools are not achieving the desired result of
            obtaining compliance, and/or there are specific safety and
            environmental concerns to address, then the matter may be referred
            to the Commission for consideration of an order or a letter of
            direction.

          <p>
            Commission orders are statutory and may be issued at any time and
            may contain direction for the company to take any measure(s) the
            Commission feels is necessary to address any safety and/or
            environmental issues or non-compliances. Letters of direction may be
            used when the Commission requires companies to take specific action,
            or stop activity, with respect to a non-compliance, without needing
            to impose any terms or conditions.

          <p>
            If the Commission has lost confidence in a company’s ability to
            operate safely and in a manner that protects people and the
            environment, or if any term or condition of a certificate, permit,
            or operating license is not complied with or has been contravened,
            the Commission may vary, revoke or suspend the company’s

          <p>
            Through a “<strong>Show Cause</strong>” hearing process, the company
            will be given the opportunity, according to the principles of
            natural justice, to present evidence, either orally or in writing,
            regarding why such measures are not necessary. Should the company
            wish to restore operation of its pipeline or related facilities
            following a revocation or suspension, it can make an application to
            the Commission and will be required to demonstrate its capability to

            the environment.

            and the regulations under these Acts. Any person found guilty of
            such contraventions could be subject to fines and/or
            imprisonment.&nbsp;The prosecution of offences under both of the
            Acts or its associated regulations is carried out by the Public

            Commission orders or decisions may be made a rule, order or decree
            of the Federal Court or of a superior court of a province, per
            section&nbsp;64 of the CER Act, for the purposes of enforcement.
            This introduces a wider range of enforcement options, including the
            possibility of a criminal proceeding for contempt of court

            Considerations in the Application of Enforcement Tools
          </h3>
          <p>
            When selecting the most appropriate action to take, the CER’s
            responses to non-compliances will be fair, predictable, consistent,
            timely and transparent based on the following considerations:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              <strong>Nature of the non-compliance:</strong> enforcement
              responses will depend on the seriousness and severity of the harm,
              or potential harm, to the public and the environment; the intent
              and negligence on the part of the company or individual; the level
              of cooperation received to achieve compliance or mitigate the
              situation; and the history of past violations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Achieving the desired outcome:</strong> the most
              appropriate tool(s) will be used to meet the desired result of
              compliance with regulatory requirements within the shortest
              timeframe, and may result in an escalation of enforcement
              responses if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Applying consistent enforcement:</strong> when deciding
              what enforcement action to take, the CER will consider previous
              compliance history, due diligence on the part of the violator, and
              consider how similar situations were resolved in the past.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The CER’s tools will form part of the CER’s records when planning
            future CVAs and in determining what enforcement action should be
            taken in the future should there be re-occurring non-compliances by
            the company.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_3">Graduated Enforcement Response Model</h3>
          <p>
            Compliance and enforcement actions are implemented on a continuum,
            and may escalate depending on the nature and severity of the
            non-compliance, the exercise of due diligence in preventing the
            non-compliance and level of cooperativeness to achieve compliance
            based on the following graduated enforcement response model:
          </p>

            <ul class="lst-spcd">

            </ul>
          </details>
          <p>
            When non-compliances are identified, CER staff will apply the
            enforcement considerations when assessing the non-compliance, and
            determine the best course of action. Although the usual process that
            is followed for routine non-compliances is a step-by-step approach
            that begins with CNCs/NNCs, matters will be escalated for
            consideration of more aggressive enforcement action based on the
            nature and severity of the non-compliance. Files that are referred
            to the Enforcement team will be investigated to determine whether
            further action is warranted, and the most appropriate tool to use
            depending on the circumstances of the non-compliance or violation.
            Each case file is individually assessed and if there is a situation
            with egregious circumstances, the CER will escalate its response
            accordingly.

                  The Oil and Gas Operations Act is a territorial statute which
                  identifies two regulators. The CER is the regulator of the
                  onshore part of the ISR that is in the Northwest Territories
                  (until 31 March 2034), and the OROGO (Office of the Regulator
                  of Oil and Gas Operations) is the de facto regulator in the
                  rest of the Northwest Territories.

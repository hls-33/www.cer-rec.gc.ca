Facsimile 403-699-1998</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Fiedorek:</p>
<p><strong>Westcoast Energy Inc. carrying on business as Spectra Energy Transmission (Westcoast)<br>
Safety Order SG-W102-002-2015 (Safety Order)</strong></p>
<p>On 9&nbsp;March 2015, the Board (Board or NEB) issued a letter advising Westcoast that Condition&nbsp;1&nbsp;(a) and&nbsp;(b) of the Safety Order remained outstanding, since the information submitted by Westcoast was insufficient to demonstrate, through a root cause analysis, where the breakdowns or failures occurred in the implementation of Westcoast’s management system or how and by what date Westcoast would correct these breakdowns or failures. Therefore, the Board directed Westcoast to complete and file with the Board a template correlating cited non-compliances with immediate and basic root causes and management system deficiencies by 22&nbsp;April 2016. On 15&nbsp;April 2016, the Board granted Westcoast an extension for this filing from 22&nbsp;April 2016 to 10&nbsp;June 2016.</p>
<p>As directed, on 10&nbsp;June 2016, Westcoast submitted a template to the Board that identified, through a root cause analysis, where breakdowns or failures occurred in the implementation of its management system. Westcoast also specified how and by what date it would correct the management system breakdowns or failures it identified in its analysis (Westcoast’s Analysis). Appendix&nbsp;A of Westcoast’s Analysis set out the commitments, deliverables and schedules to implement the preventive actions. Appendix B of Westcoast’s Analysis contained a detailed analysis of the Board’s Notice of Non-Compliance’s (NNC) and developed Corrective Action and Preventive Action and associated implementation plans. In addition, Westcoast developed systematic actions to specifically identify and correct failures within its management systems that have contributed to the NNCs.</p>
<p>The Board has reviewed Westcoast’s Analysis and is of the view that Westcoast has satisfied Conditions&nbsp;1(a) and&nbsp;(b) of the Safety Order.</p>
<p> However, in reviewing Westcoast’s analysis, the Board has identified additional management system deficiencies, as set out in Tables&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 of Schedule&nbsp;A to this letter, that require additional analysis and potential Systematic Actions development by Westcoast. </p>
<p>The Board is of the view that Westcoast’s management system analysis and proposed systematic actions do not explicitly reflect all of the systematic changes that should have been identified through its analysis of the NNC causes and Corrective Actions and Preventive Actions. The Board has identified three management system components that require explicit Systematic Actions to appropriately address Westcoast’s management system breakdowns or failures:</p>
<p><strong>1. Inspection, Measuring and Monitoring (IMM)</strong></p>
<p>The Board notes that its review of the information submitted by Westcoast identified that, of the 97&nbsp;Preventive Actions, 47 include requirements for individual actions to address inspection issues. Further, 31 of the 34&nbsp;common NNC groups have inspection related preventive actions. </p>
<p>The Board notes that Westcoast has not identified a need to address apparent IMM management system process deficiencies by identifying and implementing specific Systematic Actions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Management Review and Oversight</strong></p>
<p>In conducting its review of Westcoast’s Analysis, the Board notes that Westcoast has not attributed any of the causes or systematic deficiencies to actions taken or not taken by its management team, in particular, its Senior Management. The Board is of the view that Senior Management is accountable for ensuring that its companies are compliant, safe and that they protect the environment. In the Board’s view, to prevent re-occurrence of non-compliances, and to ensure safety and environmental protection across all of its facilities, Westcoast’s Senior Management should have been aware of the results of the Board’s compliance verification activities and ensured that these results were communicated across the company and that timely Corrective Actions and Preventive Actions were developed and implemented.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Board is directing Westcoast to examine and analyze the role played by Senior Management in contributing to these NNCs and to develop Corrective, Preventive and Systematic Actions to address deficiencies in management oversight. Westcoast’s Senior Management shall establish Management Review and Oversight management system processes that ensure that the company is operating in compliance and to ensure safety and environmental protection.</p>
<p><strong>3. Quality Assurance Programs </strong></p>
<p>Section&nbsp;10 of the <em>National Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations</em> provides:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>a company shall develop, implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance programs in respect of the design, construction, operation and abandonment of its processing plant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quality Assurance (QA) requirements are key and normal components of any management system approach. In the Board’s view, appropriately designed Quality Assurance Programs include inspection and audits of operational activities to review implementation of company requirements, regulatory compliance and general safety, environmental protection and security conditions. The systemic deficiencies identified by NEB Inspectors should have been identified and corrected through Westcoast’s existing Quality Assurance Programs. </p>
<p>The Board notes that Westcoast has not identified a need to address apparent QA management system process deficiencies by identifying and implementing specific Systematic Actions. Westcoast was directed to consider Quality Assurance activities in Schedule&nbsp;“A” of the Safety Order.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Board directs Westcoast to analyze and develop specific Systematic Actions for these three management system components, as set out in Table&nbsp;2 of Schedule A to this letter. The analysis shall utilize the same process and format as directed previously by the Board and the Systematic Actions shall be submitted for approval as part of Westcoast’s 31 October 2016 quarterly update to the Board.</p>
<p>With respect to the target dates Westcoast submitted for completion of its Corrective Actions, Preventive Actions and Systematic Actions, the Board does not find certain target dates to be reasonable in the circumstances. For example, requesting another year to integrate all hazard identification activities, train workers on the process and then create a comprehensive inventory is unreasonable given that one year has already passed since the Safety Order was issued. In the Board’s view, Westcoast should have already had a robust hazard inventory to use as a starting point. The current proposed target date leaves potential hazards uncontrolled, creating an unreasonable amount of risk to the health and safety of all workers. Accordingly, the Board directs Westcoast to amend certain target dates as set out in Table 3&nbsp;of Schedule&nbsp;A to this letter. For clarity, the Board understands the target dates to be implementation dates for the committed activities and will monitor them as such.</p>
<p> Westcoast has previously identified that it utilizes a single management system applicable to its <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em> (OPR) and PPR regulated facilities. The Board expects Westcoast’s Accountable Officer to review and verify all correspondence with respect to quarterly reporting. Westcoast may also establish and implement single processes or programs applicable to all NEB regulated facilities provided they meet the requirements of both sets of regulations as Westcoast implements its Corrective Actions, Preventive Actions and Systematic Actions.</p>
<p>In accordance with Condition 1(e) of the Safety Order, Westcoast advised in its 30 September 2015 submission to the Board that it would be filing quarterly updates on the status of Corrective Actions identified in its analysis on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>31 October 2016</li>
<li>31 January 2017</li>
<li>30 April 2017</li>
<li>31 July 2017</li>
<li>31 October 2017</li>
<li>31 January 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>The Board will be closely assessing the quarterly updates to verify that Corrective Actions have been implemented by the specified implementation dates, as applicable. The Board will determine whether the individual actions are adequately and effectively implemented during future compliance activities that will be scheduled by the Board. </p>
<p>Closure of the Corrective Actions, Preventive Actions and Systematic Actions will be based on the Board’s assessment of the outcomes of Westcoast’s actions, as measured against Westcoast’s commitments and associated implementation dates, taking into consideration any applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>The Board has asked NEB technical staff to be available to meet with Westcoast to respond to any questions relating to the new directives contained in this letter. Please contact Ryan Wells, Compliance Program Manager, Programs and Evaluation at 403-909-4655 to schedule a follow-up meeting, if needed. </p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>

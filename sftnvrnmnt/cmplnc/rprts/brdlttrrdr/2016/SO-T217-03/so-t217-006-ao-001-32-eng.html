20 September 2016</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;John&nbsp;Ferris<br>
President and CEO<br>
Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc.<br>
45 Vogell Road, Suite 310<br>
Richmond Hill, ON &nbsp;L4B&nbsp;3P6<br>
Facsimile 905-770-1639</p>
<p>Dear Mr.&nbsp;Ferris:</p>
<p><strong>Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc. (TNPI) </strong><br>
<strong>Safety Orders SG-T217-04-2009, SG-T217-01-2010, and SO-T217-03-2010</strong><br>
<strong>Amending Safety Order AO-001-SO-T217-03-2010</strong><br>
<strong>Overpressure and Pipeline Exposure Incidents</strong></p>
<p>For the reasons explained below, the National Energy Board (the Board) has decided to replace the existing Safety Orders SG-T217-01-04-2009, SG-T217-01-2010 and SG-T217-01-2010 (Safety Orders) with the attached Amending Safety Order AO-001-SO-T217-03-2010 (Amending Safety Order).</p>
<p>In 2009 and 2010, the National Energy Board (Board) issued the above three Safety Orders to TNPI, to address the causes of a number of pipeline releases and overpressure incidents on TNPI’s pipeline system. The orders directed TNPI to reduce the maximum operating pressure (MOP) of its pipeline system, in order to immediately provide the equivalent level of public safety that would be provided by a new pipeline. TNPI was also directed to make improvements that would ensure that the pipeline system could operate at the same level of safety over several years.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, TNPI has made improvements to the operation of its pipeline system. Nonetheless, overpressures have still occurred. An overpressure is when the pipeline’s operating pressure is higher, even for a very short period of time, than the maximum pressure authorized by the Board. On liquid pipelines, overpressures are most often the result of transient waves in the pipeline system caused by opening and closing valves. Pipeline systems are required to have effective overpressure systems (typically pressure-limiting controllers and/or pressure-relieving valves) to ensure that the pipeline will remain within its approved pressure range.</p>
<p>Operating a pipeline within its approved pressure range is one of the many checks and balances required by modern regulations to provide public safety and protection of the environment. After considering all of the facts surrounding the operation of the TNPI pipeline system, the Board has decided that TNPI should do more to ensure that overpressures cannot occur. Therefore the Board is directing TNPI to further reduce its maximum operating pressure by 10%. This action provides an immediate improvement in the safety of the pipeline system and addresses immediate concerns related to TNPI’s ability to control overpressure occurrences. The Board is also directing TNPI to implement a number of longer term actions, such as computer simulations of all of the ways its system can be operated, to ensure that TNPI identifies the root causes of its overpressure incidents and solves them.</p>
<p>The Board is satisfied that the pipeline continues to operate safely under the current pressure restrictions, and is likewise satisfied that the added safety factor provided by the additional pressure restriction will protect the pipeline system from the effects of any additional overpressures, while TNPI develops and implements a long term solution to resolve its overpressure hazard.</p>
<p>As part of its public interest considerations, the Board notes that TNPI’s pipeline system serves Ontario and Quebec as the system supplies fuel to major international airports and fuel outlets. The Board also notes that safety of people and the environment is our top priority. The Board is satisfied that this Amending Safety Order will provide additional protection, and consequently processes to consider a possible suspension of TNPI’s authority to operate are not required at this time.</p>
<p><em>Overview of the Amending Safety Order</em></p>
<p>The Amending Safety Order aggregates the outstanding requirements and undertakings related to the previous Safety Orders; updates the undertakings for compliance with new regulations and standards<sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>; and provides additional requirements intended to address TNPI’s ongoing non-compliances related to its overpressure system and watercourse crossing management. The Amending Safety Order directs TNPI to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement further pressure restrictions on its pipeline system;</li>
<li>File annual fitness for service assessments for its pipeline system;</li>
<li>Conduct and validate a hydraulic analysis, and develop and implement corrective and preventive measures;</li>
<li>Assess and optimize its overpressure protection system;</li>
<li>Reassess its overpressure incidents;</li>
<li>Conduct engineering assessments in accordance with the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 Clause&nbsp;10.1;</li>
<li>Implement a facility and pipeline integrity management program on its pipeline system compliant with sections&nbsp;6.1 to 6.5 and section&nbsp;40 of the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR); and</li>
<li>Develop and implement a water-crossing management program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conditions 1, 2 and 3 of the Amending Safety Order require TNPI to immediately restrict the operating pressure for its pipeline system and, within 60 days, report to the Board with the operating information specified by the Conditions. As the pipeline sections listed in Schedule A (Condition 1) were not under a pressure restriction, the restriction applied to these pipeline segments is 10%. The remaining pipeline segments listed in Schedules B and C (Conditions 2 and 3) are currently under a 20% pressure restriction, so the new pressure restriction will be 30% (i.e. 20% previous restriction + 10% new restriction). For the pipelines listed in Schedules B and C, TNPI must file an annual Fitness for Service Assessment. Annual Fitness for Service Assessments are not required for the pipelines in Schedule A, as TNPI demonstrated that they are fit for service when it applied to the Board for removal of the original pressure restriction.</p>
<p>Future requests for a return to full pressure for remaining sections of the pipeline must include fitness for service assessments. These requests can rely on the information filed for Conditions 6a and 6b in the Montreal to Farran’s Point Application, as the information regarding undertakings is common to the entire pipeline system.</p>
<p>TNPI has reported eleven overpressure incidents on its pipeline system since Safety Order SO T217 03 2010 was issued in October 2010 and has submitted a corrective action plan with respect to those incidents. The Board is of the view that the recurrence of overpressure incidents demonstrates that TNPI has not yet effectively resolved its overpressure hazard. As set out in Condition 4 of the Amending Safety Order, the Board requires TNPI to conduct a hydraulic analysis, assess and optimize its overpressure protection system.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Board is not satisfied that TNPI has addressed all possible causal factors related to its overpressure incidents, particularly with respect to management systems and organizational factors. Condition 5 of the attached Amending Safety Order requires TNPI to review its past overpressure incidents from this perspective and implement identified corrective and preventative measures.</p>
<p>The Amending Safety Order also addresses pipeline watercourse crossings. As noted in Safety Order&nbsp;SG-T217-01-2010, the Bronte Creek incident site requires remediation. The Board has included Condition 6 in the Amending Safety Order to update the requirement for TNPI to provide a Remedial Action Plan commensurate with the expectations of the NEB’s Remediation Process Guide, including the requirement for adequate stakeholder consultation. Condition 4.d. is included in response to the recent pipeline exposure incident INC2016-065 at a pipeline watercourse crossing. Condition 4.d. requires TNPI to develop and implement a water-crossing management program for its pipeline system.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the Amending Safety Order and the requirement for clear tracking and reporting, Condition 7 of the Amending Safety Order requires TNPI to retain an independent third party to track and report on TNPI’s progress in completing these requirements.</p>
<p><em>Additional Duty of Accountable Officer</em></p>
<p>In addition to the requirements of the Amending Safety Order, TNPI’s Accountable Officer is directed to file with the Board, by 31 December 2016, a report outlining how TNPI has met the requirements of the OPR sections&nbsp;6.5(1) (v), (w) and (x), and make available for the Board’s review TNPI’s required management system process and records to demonstrate that it has met the above requirements. These sections of the OPR require TNPI to establish and implement a process for evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of its management systems, establish and implement a quality assurance program for its management system, and establish and implement a process for conducting an annual management review of its management system.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>TNPI is reminded that failure to comply with the requirements of this letter and Amending Safety Order may result in an escalation of enforcement actions by the Board, up to and including suspension of TNPI’s authority to operate.</p>
<p>The Board has also taken the step of ensuring the shareholders of TNPI are aware of these matters by copying the Chief Executive Officers of the respective corporate owners of the TNPI system.</p>

<p class="text-center mrgn-tp-lg"><strong>Appendix A to Board letter dated 20 September 2016</strong></p>
<p class="text-center ">Dissent of Member Richmond and Member Ballem</p>
<p>TNPI has had six years to comply with numerous Safety Orders issued by the Board, but they have failed to fully comply. We are not confident that yet another similar Safety Order will guarantee that the changes necessary to make the pipeline as safe as possible will actually be made this time. We agree with the Majority that <strong><em>if</em></strong> and <strong><em>when</em></strong> all of the measures described in the Amending Safety Order are implemented, the pipeline system will be as safe as possible. However, until those safety measures are fully implemented, it would have been our preference to have the pipeline system shut down in the interim because TNPI’s current operational controls do not meet the requirements of the <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em> or CSA Z662-15.</p>

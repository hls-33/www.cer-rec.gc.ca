          <p>
            The safety of Canadians and protection of the environment is
            paramount for the National Energy Board (Board or NEB) when
            considering the performance of its regulated companies. The NEB
            requires regulated companies to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and
            manage any incidents associated with their operations. The Board
            holds these companies accountable for safety and environmental
            outcomes in the public interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report documents the Board’s assessment of Enbridge’s
            operations and initiatives in pipeline integrity, emergency response
            management, and control center operations. Details of the Board’s

          </p>
          <p>
            In July&nbsp;2012, Enbridge publicly announced a variety of
            improvements it was making to its pipeline control and control
            center operations. These improvements were initiated both prior to
            and as a result of the pipeline rupture near Marshall, Michigan in
            July&nbsp;2010 (the Marshall incident). In August and
            September&nbsp;2012, the NEB inspected Enbridge’s Control Room
            operations in order to assess Enbridge’s compliance with the
            relevant requirements of the
            <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999</em> (OPR-99). The Board’s
            inspection and assessment included a review of Enbridge’s:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pipeline Control and Leak Detection System;</li>
            <li>Pipeline Integrity Management Program;</li>
            <li>Emergency Procedures Program and Public Awareness;</li>
            <li>
              Management system processes, as required under the OPR-99 and
              CSA-Z662,<sup><a href="#ftn1back" id="ftn1">[1]</a></sup> to
              provide for the protection of people, property and the
              environment; and
            </li>
            <li>Safety Culture.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Through its review, the Board found that issues related to
            management systems, human factors<sup
              ><a href="#ftn2back" id="ftn2">[2]</a></sup
            >
            and team performance in the Enbridge control room directly
            contributed to the severity of the Marshall incident. Had the
            rupture been identified and acted upon earlier, the volume of the
            release and resulting impacts would have been greatly reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the course of its inspection, the Board did not identify
            non-compliances with its regulations that would pose an immediate
            hazard to public safety or the environment. The Board notes that
            Enbridge has initiated a broad range of improvement actions.
            Enbridge’s leadership has undertaken efforts to improve its safety
            culture starting with a commitment from the top of the organization,
            which is an important part of safety culture advancement. Enbridge
            has also begun implementing an integrated management system. This is
            consistent with the Board’s expectations for an effective management
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of Enbridge’s reported improvements are multi-year initiatives
            that had not been fully implemented at the time of the verification.
            The Board will continue to monitor and assess all of Enbridge’s
            reported improvements until they are fully implemented.
          </p>
          <p>
            Concurrently with the release of this report the Board is issuing an
            Order SO-E101-003 -2013 to address the outstanding issues identified
            in the Board’s inspection. The Board will continue to monitor the
            implementation and effectiveness of Enbridge’s programs and
            management system through targeted compliance verification
            activities.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s2">Introduction and Background</h2>
          <p>
            Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership (“EELP”), a United States (US)
            entity, sustained a rupture on its pipeline, identified as Line 6B,
            in Marshall, Michigan, US, on 25&nbsp;July&nbsp;2010 at
            15:58&nbsp;PM MST. The rupture resulted in the release of
            approximately 3.2 million litres of crude oil products. The product
            saturated the surrounding wetlands and flowed into the Talmadge
            Creek and eventually into the Kalamazoo River. At the time, EELP’s
            Line 6B was operated by its Canadian affiliate, Enbridge Pipelines
            Inc. (“Enbridge”).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Enbridge control center, located in Edmonton, Alberta, received
            a series of alarms and observed an unusual pressure drop during the
            shutdown phase. Enbridge incorrectly attributed the alarms to column
            separation.<sup><a href="#ftn3back" id="ftn3">[3]</a></sup> Over the
            course of the next 17&nbsp;hours, Enbridge repeatedly misinterpreted
            a series of alarms, did not follow approved procedures, and
            attempted to re-start the line twice while still unaware of the
            rupture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge continued its attempt to resolve the suspected column
            separation on Line 6B when, at 11:17&nbsp;AM EDT on
            26&nbsp;July&nbsp;2010, the control room center was notified of the
            rupture via a telephone call to their emergency line. Enbridge then
            isolated the rupture site from the remainder of the pipeline at
            11:18&nbsp;AM&nbsp;MST.
          </p>
          <p>
            These actions and the ineffectiveness of the initial containment
            efforts resulted in a large volume of oil escaping the rupture.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 10 July&nbsp;2012, the US National Transportation Safety Board
            (NTSB) released its Pipeline Accident Report regarding the Enbridge
            rupture at Marshall. According to the NTSB report, the rupture and
            prolonged release was attributed to “pervasive organizational
            failures” at Enbridge that included deficient pipeline integrity
            management procedures, inadequate training of control center
            personnel, insufficient public awareness and education programs, and
            an ineffective emergency response.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to the completion of the NTSB investigation, Enbridge
            publically disclosed that it implemented operational and procedural
            changes in&nbsp;2010 and&nbsp;2011, based on its own internal
            investigation into the Marshall incident. These changes involved
            pipeline and facility integrity, leak and pipeline control, control
            center operations, public awareness and emergency response, and
            safety culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notified Enbridge by way of letter dated
            26&nbsp;July&nbsp;2012 that an inspection of its Edmonton control
            center operations would be conducted on 8 and
            9&nbsp;August&nbsp;2012 to assess its compliance with the OPR-99.
            Further to the August inspection, a supplementary inspection of
            Enbridge’s control room was conducted on
            12&nbsp;September&nbsp;2012. The principal purpose of the
            supplementary inspection was to observe the practical aspects of
            Enbridge’s control room operations.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s3">Pipeline Control and Leak Detection</h2>
          <p>
            Enbridge has implemented various operational and procedural changes
            based on its own internal investigation and in direct response to
            the Marshall incident. The NEB’s review of Enbridge’s pipeline
            control and leak detection area was designed to assess if the many
            improvements reported by Enbridge regarding control room management
            and leak detection are effective. This was done to confirm whether
            Enbridge can operate its pipeline systems safely and avoid a
            Marshall-type incident in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Marshall incident, two Enbridge pipelines regulated by
            other jurisdictional authorities have experienced large leaks. In
            both cases, these leaks were detected by control room staff within
            an acceptable timeframe and resulted in the lines being shut down
            immediately. In addition, demonstrations of a simulated abnormal
            operation observed by the Board were dealt with in accordance with
            Enbridge’s procedures. Based on improvements made and observations
            by the NEB of simulations, it is the Board’s view that Enbridge
            control center staff now have the tools necessary to avoid previous
            mistakes related to pipeline incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB also conducted an analysis and review of reported
            over-pressure incidents occurring on low pressure piping within
            Enbridge facilities. The Board sought to determine if any aspects of
            control room operations contributed to the incidents or if the
            incidents could have been prevented by enhancing control room
            operations. The assessment determined that control room operations
            were not a direct contributing factor to the incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board finds that Enbridge is in compliance with the requirements
            of the OPR-99. In order to promote continual improvement, Enbridge
            should also consider making improvements to enhance pipeline system
            control and leak detection capabilities, while reducing the time for
            diagnosing the leak or column separation and responding to a
            rupture. These improvements would include, but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Establishing processes and procedures that would treat a pipeline
              rupture (defined as an abrupt and uncontrollable release)
              differently than a leak (defined as a gradual and controllable
              release);
            </li>
            <li>
              Evaluating shutdown procedures to minimize column separation and
              automating the announcement and analysis process if a column
              separation is detected; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilizing some SCADA<sup
                ><a href="#ftn4back" id="ftn4">[4]</a></sup
              >
              screens to display the high consequence areas or critical
              locations along the pipeline route, so that operators are able to
              pay particular attention to them in the event of a rupture or a
              leak.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="s4">Pipeline Integrity Management Program</h2>
          <p>
            Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to
            incorporate integrity management programs into their day-to-day
            operations. These programs include the tools, technologies and
            actions needed to ensure that pipelines are safe and remain that way
            over time. Integrity management programs help pipeline companies
            predict and prevent failures before they happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the Control Room inspection of 8 and
            9&nbsp;August&nbsp;2012, the Board is satisfied with the incremental
            improvements and initiatives Enbridge has made to its integrity
            management program, both prior to and after the Marshall incident.
            These improvements are reflected in changes made to Enbridge’s
            organizational structure, setting performance goals, increasing
            condition monitoring and associated spending, and various integrity
            verification processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge has already completed some improvements, such as sharing
            information amongst its asset management teams to better understand
            how integrity and operating conditions can impact safety and
            reliability. Other improvements, such as seeking to improve in-line
            inspection (ILI) performance with industry participants and vendors,
            will be an ongoing endeavour. Additional improvements, such as
            assessing the condition of individual pipelines based on a holistic
            approach to multiple integrity threats, are still being implemented.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board will conduct further verification activities to confirm
            that Enbridge’s improvements are being proactively implemented in an
            expedient manner on a system-wide basis. The Board will also verify
            whether these improvements were being periodically reviewed by
            Enbridge to assess their effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            As further verification of the implementation of these various
            initiatives is required, the Board has ordered Enbridge to file a
            table that clearly identifies all the integrity management system
            and program changes undertaken since July&nbsp;2010. In this table,
            Enbridge must describe how each change will lead to improvements in
            safety and integrity, identify the performance metrics, and indicate
            the current stage of completion for each improvement. If not yet
            fully implemented, Enbridge must provide the expected date(s) of
            full implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has also ordered Enbridge to file its management review of
            its Pipeline Integrity Management Program with the Board. This
            review must demonstrate senior management’s leadership and
            engagement in assessing opportunities for improvement, and assess
            the need for changes to the Program in order to achieve its
            objectives.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s5">Emergency Management Program</h2>
          <p>
            The Board requires pipeline companies to anticipate, prevent, manage
            and mitigate potentially dangerous conditions associated with their
            facilities. As part of this requirement, each regulated company must
            provide up-to-date emergency response plans for the Board’s review
            and which outline the company emergency management procedures to be
            followed during an incident. The procedures must address emergency
            management, worker and public safety, and environmental protection.
            In addition, companies are required to develop a training program
            and conduct exercises to verify their capabilities in responding to
            incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of the control room inspections conducted in August and
            September&nbsp;2012, the NEB has confirmed Enbridge’s intent and
            commitment to improve its emergency response and public awareness
            programs. Enbridge has begun taking actions to redevelop its
            Emergency Management Program as a result of the Marshall incident.
            This includes a third-party assessment of its emergency response
            capability, state of readiness to respond to an emergency, and its
            ability to successfully contain potential spills. Actions being
            implemented as a result of the capability assessment, completed in
            December&nbsp;2012, will not be in place until a review of the
            findings is conducted and corrective actions are determined by
            Enbridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Board’s inspections, no non-compliances were identified
            related to Enbridge’s emergency management program. The Board notes
            that Enbridge Control Center Operations staff are trained in
            emergency management procedures and participate in emergency
            management exercises. Many of Enbridge’s completion targets are set
            for&nbsp;2013. As a result, the Board will continue to monitor and
            evaluate the adequacy of Enbridge’s improvements related to its
            emergency response program until they are fully implemented. An
            assessment of the adequacy and implementation of Enbridge’s revised
            emergency response program will occur during Board compliance
            verification activities planned for&nbsp;2013, including an
            assessment of Enbridge’s emergency response exercises.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has ordered Enbridge to notify the Board at least
            60&nbsp;days prior to conducting an emergency response exercise
            in&nbsp;2013-2014. In the notification, Enbridge must describe the
            exercise scenario, the participants to be invited, and the elements
            of the company’s emergency response program to be tested, along with
            the date, time and location of the exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has also ordered Enbridge to file with the Board, in
            accordance with Section 32 of the OPR-99, any reference material
            that will be used by Enbridge’s staff during an emergency response.
            This includes any guidebooks that may be used that are not otherwise
            found in Enbridge’s Emergency Procedures Manual (Book&nbsp;7). This
            also includes any on-call procedures that may be used to initiate an
            emergency response that are not found in Book&nbsp;7.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s6">Management System Processes</h2>
          <p>
            Management systems set out policies, processes and procedures for
            the planning and execution of an organization’s core business to
            manage the safety of people and protection of the environment
            throughout the lifecycle of a pipeline system. The Board expects a
            pipeline company’s approach to operations to be systematic,
            comprehensive and proactive in managing risks. This approach should
            be integrated into a company’s overall management system. The safety
            component of the management system should articulate the
            organization’s commitment and approach to safe operations throughout
            all aspects of its business.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board found that a number of management system shortcomings
            contributed to the ineffective response by control room staff to the
            Marshall incident. The use of an unapproved, draft procedure
            indicated weaknesses in Enbridge’s document management process.
            Also, the control room’s organizational structure, roles and
            responsibilities, and lines of authority for decision-making were
            unclear. There was also evidence of insufficient training related to
            various positions within the control room at the time of the
            Marshall Incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Marshall Incident, Enbridge has placed significant
            emphasis on organizational restructuring, new control room
            infrastructure, procedures, training, and communication with
            stakeholders. During the inspection activities in the fall
            of&nbsp;2012, the Board noted that Enbridge has moved to an
            integrated management system (EIMS) to provide cohesion and
            standardization to 14 management systems. Enbridge has subsequently
            informed the Board that they have added two management systems
            within the EIMS for a total of&nbsp;16. Although the EIMS is still
            being implemented, its content is consistent with NEB expectations
            for an effective management system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Enbridge Pipeline Integrity Group has been restructured to
            include a Vice President of Integrity, an integrity reliability
            section, and a Quality Management System position. The Integrity
            Management Program (IMP) also now includes a continual improvement
            review step. The Board expects that the review step will include
            senior management involvement and feedback to the CEO. Alignment of
            the IMP with other programs should be as much of a priority as
            aligning the IMP with the EIMS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge also advised the Board that it is currently incorporating
            processes identified in the NEB Proposed Regulatory Change on
            Management Systems to create a Pipeline Control Management System
            (PCMS). The PCMS has the potential to provide long-term stability
            and continual improvement for the Control Center. Once the PCMS is
            fully implemented, the NEB will evaluate its integration with
            Enbridge’s Control Room Management Plan in a future compliance
            activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board finds there are no immediate areas of concern with regards
            to Enbridge’s management system. In order to promote continual
            improvement, Enbridge should review the observations and conclusions
            made by the Board in this report regarding management systems and
            incorporate those findings into its own internal processes and
            programs that relate to management systems. The Board will continue

            that the changes are fully implemented.

          <h2 id="s7">Safety Culture</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB requires its regulated companies to promote a positive
            safety culture in order to effectively manage threats to safety.
            Overall, safety management is made up of several different
            strategies and activities designed to eliminate or reduce risk to
            the public, workers, the environment and assets. Safety culture
            initiatives identify and manage cultural influences that have the
            ability to either support or detract from this outcome. An effective
            safety culture also includes but is not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>leadership commitment and adequate resourcing;</li>
            <li>
              effective communication between employees and management about
              potential hazards in the workplace;
            </li>
            <li>employee involvement in safety-related activities; and</li>
            <li>
              processes and procedures to ensure continual improvement and
              learning from previous occurrences.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Board expects safety culture programs within its regulated
            companies to apply to both worker health and safety, and process
            safety. Process safety focusses on preventing catastrophic incidents
            associated with the use of chemicals and petroleum products.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of its inspection and assessment, the NEB sought to obtain
            information regarding the current culture of safety of Enbridge,
            with specific focus on the Control Center Operations. To gather
            information, the NEB conducted meetings with Enbridge management and
            staff, and reviewed documents related to Enbridge’s internal safety
            perception surveys and related follow-up action items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several safety-related gap analyses, workshops, and work plans were
            completed by Enbridge following the Marshall incident. In several
            instances, action items have been or are in the process of being
            implemented. Enbridge’s leadership is also undertaking efforts to
            improve its culture of safety, including the creation of a
            director-level position directly responsible for safety culture.
            This level of commitment is a critical part of any safety culture
            advancement. The senior managers, managers, and staff that met with
            the NEB during the August inspections consistently demonstrated a
            high level of commitment to operational safety over other competing
            pressures, such as production.
          </p>
          <p>
            Employee safety culture perception surveys focussing on leadership,
            structure, processes and actions, have been conducted and the
            results have informed future action plans. These surveys are
            designed to measure employee perception of several indicators, which
            may be related to safety culture. They may also identify gaps in
            perception across levels of personnel (i.e., senior managers and
            frontline staff). While these perception surveys can be useful, they
            may not provide accurate intelligence about system, process, or
            cultural deficiencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Board notes Enbridge is still at the early stages of
            implementation, it is encouraged by the initiatives taken by the
            company in the area of safety culture. The Board’s review of
            documentation including presentations and safety action plans, found
            that Enbridge did not always interpret the term “safety culture” to
            include process safety outcomes. Process safety management has
            already received some heightened attention in the Liquid Pipelines
            Group, however the Board found that its relationship to safety
            culture may not be consistently understood or applied across all
            departments in the business unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has ordered Enbridge to conduct a safety culture
            assessment based on a validated tool designed for that purpose.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s8">Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            The Board expects regulated companies to promote a positive safety
            culture as part of their management systems. As a part of this,
            companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
            improvement in safety, security, and environmental protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of the Board’s August and September inspections, the
            Board did not identify any non-compliances with its regulations that
            would pose an immediate hazard to public safety or the environment.
            The Board notes the role of human factors in the sequence of events
            in the Enbridge control room on 25 and 26&nbsp;July&nbsp;2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Marshall incident, Enbridge initiated a broad range of
            actions to improve the operation of its control room. Some of these
            have come as a direct result of Enbridge’s and the NTSB’s
            investigations into the Marshall incident, while the initiation of
            other improvements preceded the rupture. Enbridge is in the midst of
            implementing all of its corrective actions, with full implementation
            of most changes expected in&nbsp;2013. When these improvements have
            been implemented, the Board will assess their effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            This compliance activity was not an audit, and while many programs
            were reviewed, an assessment of each element of Enbridge’s
            management system was not conducted. As a result, and in order to
            evaluate the effectiveness of Enbridge’s plans, the Board is also
            ordering Enbridge to undertake a third-party audit to fully examine
            the company’s management system, any human factors associated with
            control room operation, and the safety culture of the organization
            as a whole. The NEB will set the parameters of the audit and the
            third-party auditor will report directly and be fully accountable to
            the Board.

                  The Pipeline Control Systems and Leak Detection (PCSLD)
                  department is now under a single director, to whom the
                  Pipeline Control System manager and Leak Detection manager
                  report. The new organization elevates the importance of leak
                  detection capabilities and creates a single point of
                  accountability in relation to pipeline control system
                  capabilities and leak detection. Additional control centre
                  staff have been hired and trained in their respective
                  subjects, using the new draft control room management
                  procedures.

                <p>
                  Significant improvements have been made by Enbridge in
                  organization structure, procedures, training, infrastructure
                  upgrades, infrastructure, information management support and
                  system effectiveness. Enbridge has implemented a Quality
                  Management System for leak detection activities to meet the
                  leak detection program’s objectives. This is also intended to
                  provide better information for annual management review.

                  Enbridge has implemented a new leak detection escalation
                  process, shift change transitions, analysis and communication
                  procedures, as well as a quality management system to ensure
                  that critical work activities meet pre-defined quality
                  objectives. Enbridge revised its leak detection escalation
                  process so that any confirmed column separation is treated as
                  a leak trigger. When the number of leak triggers reaches three
                  (3), the control room operator is required to shut down the
                  pipeline. Enbridge’s leak detection analysis training program
                  has been improved through on-the-job and additional
                  simulator-based training. The improved training program
                  includes common root causes of MBS alarms, a staff readiness
                  assessment, and improved communications with Control Centre
                  Operations (CCO) personnel. Some of these revised procedures
                  had not yet received management approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, Enbridge’s Leak Detection Department is
                  developing tools using advanced computer systems to help its
                  control room operations staff reliably analyze abnormal
                  operating conditions such as column separation and potential
                  leaks.

                  The Mass Balance System (MBS) is computer program that
                  estimates the pipeline imbalance using pressures and flow
                  rates. It estimates the sectional imbalance using the measured
                  flow rates and calculated line pack changes in a section of
                  the pipeline using the pipeline pressure and liquid
                  properties. The line pack calculations are based on a
                  transient modeling technique using pressure and commodity
                  movement data received from the host SCADA on a real-time
                  basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An MBS analyst is required because the MBS system is very
                  complex, requires extensive training, and the operators are
                  already busy performing other operational tasks. The real-time
                  data and model results can be displayed in various formats;
                  distance plots, time plots and tabular (reports) format as
                  well as custom displays. An MBS analyst can access multiple
                  displays, including but not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Pressure/flow profile plot - the operators can also access
                    these profiles;
                  </li>
                  <li>Section imbalance trend plots;</li>
                  <li>Flow trend plot;</li>
                  <li>Pressure trend plot; and</li>
                  <li>
                    Pump station suction and discharge pressure trend plot.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  When an operator reports an MBS alarm, the MBS analyst first
                  accesses multiple data and information sources during
                  comprehensive analysis following detailed documented
                  procedures. The analyst has to finish assessing the alarm
                  within 10&nbsp;minutes in order to satisfy the 10-minute
                  pipeline shut-down rule. The analyst checks the imbalance plot
                  of the suspected section, and then reviews the flow trend plot
                  to determine the start time of the imbalance. Subsequently,
                  the analyst checks the pressure and station pressure trends,
                  among other displays, to determine if the alarm is valid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Enbridge’s leak statistics indicated that the number of false
                  alarms for Line&nbsp;2 are much larger than that for
                  Line&nbsp;4, even though both lines transport similar crudes
                  and their pipeline configurations are similar, with the
                  exception of the drag reducing agent (DRA) operation in Line
                  2. Enbridge indicated that the false alarm rate has dropped
                  since July&nbsp;2012, with the improved hydraulic calculations
                  using a new DRA correlation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A leak within a pump station can be detected by looking at
                  disparity alarms caused by sudden pressure drops, throttling
                  change, and/or change in control. Two suction and discharge
                  pressure transmitters are installed at all mainline pump
                  stations and holding pressure points:  Each of the suction and
                  discharge pressure transmitters are installed closer to the
                  pipeline side, and another set of suction and discharge
                  pressure transmitters are also installed closer to the pump
                  units. The two main purposes of such a setup are to make the
                  station pressures available at all times and to detect
                  potential abnormal conditions, such as leaks within the pump
                  stations.

                  The Board observed that the above plots are displayed
                  separately and reviewed sequentially. If the four trend plots
                  are displayed on one large screen, the review process could be
                  faster and the relationships between trend plots could be
                  analyzed more accurately.

                  Enbridge has established a leak detection equipment design
                  standard to ensure that leak detection performance standards
                  are met. The equipment standard specifies flow, pressure and
                  temperature measurements in terms of meter types and
                  installation locations. Assessments for instrumentation
                  additions and upgrades have been completed to improve the
                  performance of the leak detection system. For example, flow
                  and pressure measurement devices have been classified as
                  critical, and therefore flow measurement will be installed at
                  every pump station. Two redundant pressure transmitters are
                  already installed at most pump stations. The leak detection
                  maintenance management program has also been internally
                  reviewed and improved.

                  In addition, Enbridge has made several improvements to its
                  MBS. Enbridge is implementing dynamic alarm thresholds to
                  reduce false alarms during transient conditions and to improve
                  leak sensitivity during steady state conditions. Enbridge’s
                  Leak Detection Department has developed system effectiveness
                  metrics, which include improvements to leak detection systems
                  as a scorecard, applications of API&nbsp;1130 testing and
                  API&nbsp;1149 leak sensitivity analysis. The API&nbsp;1130
                  testing program covers on-going simulated and/or actual fluid
                  withdrawal tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Enbridge has initiated several projects to assess if further
                  improvements to leak detection performance can be achieved
                  through new technologies such as acoustic wave and in-line
                  technology.

                  The US Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration
                  (PHMSA) audited Enbridge’s control room management in
                  December&nbsp;2011 and January&nbsp;2012. Enbridge stated that
                  it has enhanced the CCO CRM Plan and associated processes. The
                  CRM plan clearly defines roles and responsibilities of the
                  pipeline operator, shift supervisor, senior technical advisor,
                  leak detection analyst and technical support staff during
                  normal, abnormal and emergency operations. Also, the CRM plan
                  defines the actions that these control room staff are
                  prohibited from taking. PHMSA issued a Notification of
                  Amendment (NOA) on July&nbsp;06,&nbsp;2012. Enbridge submitted
                  its response addressing the issues identified by PHMSA on
                  August&nbsp;08,&nbsp;2012.

                <p>
                  The CCO CRM Plan was written to meet the US regulator’s
                  requirements. It has some basic management system elements,
                  but is not a complete management system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Enbridge advised the Board that it is currently incorporating
                  processes identified in the NEB Proposed Regulatory Change on
                  Management Systems (PRC-2011-01) to create a Pipeline Control
                  Management System (PCMS) program. The PCMS has all expected
                  management system elements identified and linked to Enbridge’s
                  Integrated Management System. However, the program development
                  is in progress with a completion targeted for the end
                  of&nbsp;2012.

                  Enbridge has reviewed its existing CCO procedures and
                  identified issues and opportunities, conducted benchmarking
                  and best practices research, and revised or otherwise

                  The outgoing operators are required to fill out a new shift
                  change form, and the form should be signed by both the
                  outgoing and incoming operators. A review of random samples of
                  the shift change logs revealed the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The time for shift changes range from 5&nbsp;minutes to
                    31&nbsp;minutes, depending on the number of operational
                    changes in the pipeline.

                  <li>
                    All forms that were reviewed were signed off by the outgoing

                </ul>
                <p>
                  Most operators reviewed the documentation and checked it off,
                  but some did not. The supervisor did not seem to realize that
                  some of the documentation was not checked off, so it was not
                  clear if the operator did not review the documentation or
                  whether they had reviewed it but forgot to check it off. The
                  Board will further assess the implementation effectiveness of
                  shift change procedures.

                    monitoring and control of information on SCADA. The Enbridge
                    existing SCADA screen displays did not consistently use
                    color as specified in API&nbsp;1165 to provide information
                    to the controller. Should the SCADA system be expanded or
                    replaced or another SCADA system added, Enbridge stated they

                    controlling liquid pipeline pressures and/or flows,
                    monitoring the leak detection system, operation of remote

                    Leak Detection Analyst - qualified to analyze an MBS alarm
                    and determine if it is valid. This position was previously
                    called the “MBS Analyst”.

                  <li>
                    Shift Supervisor - this position was previously called
                    “Shift Lead”, but now the Shift Supervisor does not have any
                    technical roles or responsibilities. The roles and
                    responsibilities of the Shift Lead have been reallocated
                    between the Shift supervisor and the Senior Technical
                    Advisor.

                  <li>
                    Technical Support Staff - individuals including CCO
                    Technical Services Coordinators and Advisors, CCO Projects
                    Specialists, Coordinators and Advisors. Under the new roles,
                    these positions should not be directly involved in
                    operations.

                  On each shift, one shift supervisor and one senior technical
                  advisor are assigned as a pair to each of pipeline operation
                  and terminal operation. The pipeline operator and terminal
                  operator share certain data such as pump order, but the
                  pipeline operator does not have the authority to control
                  terminals and the terminal operator does not have the
                  authority to control the pipeline.
                </p>

                  Before the Marshall incident, staff’s roles and
                  responsibilities in the CCO were not well-defined. Now, they
                  are documented in the CRM Plan, and all staff must be trained
                  and aware of them. Staff members were involved in developing
                  the new roles and responsibilities as well as the revised
                  procedures. During the inspection, Enbridge operations staff
                  commented that their roles and responsibilities are now more
                  specific and clear and that formalizing procedures and
                  clarifying roles/responsibilities help them operate the
                  pipeline more effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  New staff must complete five (5) phases of training, each of
                  which consists of multiple module training sessions. The modes
                  of training include classroom training, a written module-based
                  self-training, simulator-based training, and on-the-job
                  training. The training simulations are realistic. For example,
                  pump station and unit simulation training includes the PLC
                  logic and pump curves in order to simulate the station
                  operation realistically. From Phase 2 training and onward,
                  each trainee begins to work with a mentor on a live pipeline
                  system. The terminal operators receive different console
                  training than the pipeline operators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the Marshall incident, the training curricula has been
                  enhanced, particularly in the area of abnormal operating
                  conditions. Pipeline rupture scenarios related specifically to
                  pipeline shutdowns were not part of standard training
                  previously, but now they are included in the standard training
                  curricula.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trainees have to undertake a written examination at the
                  completion of each module, and their proficiency and
                  competency are evaluated at the completion of each phase. The
                  trainees in Phase 5 are expected to take both written and oral
                  tests. At a minimum, the operators are required to be
                  re-certified in every three years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To promote communication, cross-training is also provided for
                  those who work together. One example is the operator and
                  senior technical advisor. The cross-training can be on an
                  individual or team basis. The operators are cross-trained on
                  up to three (3) consoles. Since the Marshall incident, the
                  staff work load has been measured and rebalanced.

                    design and construction of a new Control Centre in Edmonton,
                    Alberta.&nbsp; The new Centre was opened in
                    December&nbsp;2011 and enhances the work environment for its
                    operators and allows greater interaction and support for
                    24x7 hour operations.</em

                  Special features of the control centre include noise
                  suppression, indirect lighting that changes the brightness
                  according to the circadian cycle, and adjustable consoles to
                  allow for both sitting and standing positions. A working group
                  was implemented to improve fatigue management for the control
                  centre staff. To manage fatigue, particularly from 2:00am to
                  6:00am, gym and exercise facilities are made available. A
                  kitchen facility is also stocked with food. In addition, first
                  aid kits and fire extinguishers were visible at several
                  locations.

                <p>
                  The consoles used by the operators are situated on the right
                  and left hand sides of the center row. The pipeline operator
                  consoles and terminal operator consoles are arranged side by
                  side for clear communication via sharing certain common
                  information such as pump orders. The senior technical advisors
                  work in the center row, in order to be easily accessed by the
                  operators. The shift supervisors, leak detection analysts, CCO
                  engineers, and other support staff are situated on the outer
                  sides of the control center. The offices of both the pipeline
                  and terminal control centre managers are located adjacent to
                  the operator consoles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The operators usually operate two pipeline systems. In order
                  to minimize the impact of a power outage, two
                  geographically-separated pipelines are paired for one
                  operator. Enbridge has also added operators in order to
                  balance the workload.

                  Enbridge’s stated goal is “zero failures and leaks”. An
                  objective of this goal is to prevent leaks and if an incident
                  occurs it is to be detected and responded to quickly. A set of
                  lagging and leading performance measures were provided by
                  Enbridge to support this objective.

                  teams to better understand how integrity and operating
                  conditions can impact safety and reliability. Other
                  improvements, such as seeking to improve in-line inspection
                  (ILI) performance with industry participants and vendors, will
                  be an ongoing endeavor. Additional improvements, such as
                  assessing the condition of individual pipelines based on a
                  holistic approach to multiple integrity threats, are still
                  being implemented.

                  inspections by Enbridge. A substantial increase in inspections

                  Enbridge has determined that additional/enhanced emergency
                  response training is needed to ensure a state of readiness to
                  respond. Enbridge staff has already begun training in various
                  areas that support emergency response. Enbridge has committed
                  to training staff that are expected to respond to emergencies
                  with appropriate and adequate Incident Command Systems (ICS)
                  training. At a minimum, all response staff will have
                  ICS&nbsp;100/200 training, followed by ICS&nbsp;300 training.
                  Currently, more than 600 Enbridge staff
                  have&nbsp;ICS&nbsp;100/200 training and more than 200 have
                  additional ICS&nbsp;300 training. Future training will be
                  enhanced with additional role-specific training, ICS&nbsp;320
                  and Incident Action Plan (IAP) software training. Other
                  training available for response staff is Exercise Design and

                  IAP software has been purchased from The Response Group (TRG)
                  to assist in the management of incident response. The software
                  has real-time information capability and supports Enbridge’s
                  emergency response plan specifics. The IAP software supports
                  the ICS. In the event that the software or internet access
                  needed to use the software is unavailable, “go kits” with hard
                  copies are available for deployment.

                  Through a consultation process with emergency responders and
                  others, Enbridge has re-evaluated its emergency response
                  equipment needs. Enbridge plans to purchase additional
                  emergency response equipment across the system. The equipment
                  will be compatible across all regions to ensure continuity.
                  This will also ensure that staff who respond to emergencies
                  are familiar with response equipment. Enbridge filed its
                  updated Emergency Procedures manual (Book 7) with the Board at
                  end of November&nbsp;2012.

                  Enbridge’s Operating and Maintenance Procedures (“OMPs”)
                  contain most elements expected in a Management System.
                  Enbridge has engaged an independent third party to conduct a
                  review of the OMPs and to assist with refinements and
                  development of all of its 16 management systems. As part of
                  that process the adequacy and effectiveness of the emergency
                  preparedness and response capabilities will be conducted as
                  part of the Emergency Readiness and Response System.

                  Enbridge contracted TRG to conduct a third party capability
                  assessment to determine Enbridge’s emergency response
                  capability, state of readiness to respond to an emergency, and
                  the ability to successfully contain potential spills. Further
                  assessment will be focused on areas of greatest consequence.
                  The review is expected to be completed by the end
                  of&nbsp;2012. Various methods are being used to conduct the
                  assessment, such as phone interviews and face to face
                  interviews with staff. The results of the assessment will be
                  used to identify areas for improvement, which will then be
                  addressed through corrective action plans.

                  Enbridge has developed an Emergency Response Advisory Team
                  (ERAT). The focus of this group is to share information on
                  responses, training, exercises and lessons learned regarding
                  emergency response in each region. The team consists of
                  members across Enbridge in Canada and the United States.
                  Enbridge’s goal is to have a monthly call-in meeting and to
                  meet face-to-face each quarter.

                  Enbridge has developed an Enterprise Emergency Response Team
                  (E3RT). The focus of this team is to receive role-specific
                  training that can be applied to worst-case scenario events.
                  The objective of the E3RT is to be able to respond cohesively
                  across the Enbridge enterprise. This will enhance additional
                  support during an emergency beyond regional boundaries.
                  Members of the team have a minimum of ICS&nbsp;300 training. A
                  minimum of three Enbridge employees have been trained to
                  fulfill critical roles. This will ensure adequate resources
                  are available in worst-case scenario events.

                  A new position, Director, Safety Culture, has been created and
                  staffed, which indicates an awareness of the importance to
                  advance this safety area. The position is based in the US and
                  has responsibility for all of North America. There are no
                  additional resources (departmental team members) dedicated to
                  support the initiative. Deficiencies noted during this review
                  suggest that the organization would benefit from greater
                  collaboration and oversight being provided by more than a
                  single subject matter expert/advocate.

                  Process safety management is receiving heightened attention in

                  management to safety culture has not been applied consistently
                  across all departments in the business unit. For example, the
                  project charter for the Control Center Safety Culture
                  Improvement Team states that its purpose is to seek an injury
                  and incident-free workplace, with its scope defined as
                  focusing on “safety and health of CCO and field employees

                  Enbridge has contracted DuPont to conduct internal safety
                  culture perception surveys designed to measure employee
                  perception of several indicators, which may be related to
                  safety culture (as defined by DuPont). It is important to note
                  that these surveys identify gaps in perception across levels
                  of personnel (i.e., senior managers and frontline staff) and
                  may or may not provide accurate intelligence about actual
                  system, process, or cultural deficiencies.

                  Several areas requiring improvement were noted when compared
                  to other high performing company scores (identified by DuPont
                  and based upon occupational health and safety performance such
                  as injury frequency rates and other onsite assessments not
                  detailed in the documents provided). However, it should again
                  be noted that these comparisons may or may not be meaningful
                  based on the selection criteria used by DuPont. Action items
                  were identified for each department based on the results of
                  the survey. Implementation plans have been developed for these
                  action items and in many cases, implementation is well
                  underway. The next perception survey is scheduled
                  for&nbsp;2013 in order to assess any changes
                  post-implementation.

                  Documents, action plans, and presentations related to safety

                  and application of the term “safety culture”. In many
                  instances, it appears to be viewed in the context of
                  occupational health and safety only. In others cases, it is
                  noted as also including process safety management and

                  initiatives based on hazards and risks associated with

          <h2 id="s1">Chapter&nbsp;1 - Summary</h2>
          <p>
            On 24&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012, a release of 90&nbsp;m&sup3; of crude
            oil into the secondary containment of Tank&nbsp;121 at Trans
            Mountain Pipeline ULC’s (TMPU) Sumas Terminal in Abbotsford, BC
            occurred. The investigation revealed that the leak occurred after a
            gasket in a flange pair of the Tank&nbsp;121 roof drain system
            failed under excessive pressure caused by water freezing in the roof
            drain system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although TMPU had a new procedure requiring the tank roof drain
            valve to normally be closed, the tank roof drain valve was open at
            the time of the incident. This was a contributing factor to the
            incident. The investigation found that TMPU’s management of the
            procedural change to the normal drain valve position was inadequate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leak was detected later than it should have been. This can be
            attributed to the fact that the Control Centre Operator (CCO) did
            not follow TMPU’s procedures on two occasions when setting and
            responding to the alarms and failed to recognize the leak situation.
            The investigation found that there were improper alarm settings in
            TMPU’s new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system
            and this may have contributed to the CCO’s inadequate response to
            the alarms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The safety of Canadians and protection of the environment are the
            National Energy Board’s (NEB or Board) top priorities. The Board
            requires pipeline companies to anticipate, prevent, manage and
            mitigate potentially dangerous conditions associated with their
            pipelines. TMPU has identified corrective actions to address all of
            the findings of cause and contributing factors identified in this
            investigation report. The Board is satisfied that these actions are
            appropriate to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the
            future.

          <h3 id="s3_1">3.1 Incident Description</h3>
          <p>
            Early in the morning of 24&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012, a release of
            crude oil from Tank&nbsp;121 at TMPU’s Sumas Terminal in Abbotsford,
            BC occurred (see Maps&nbsp;1, 2 and&nbsp;3 in
            <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>). Approximately 90&nbsp;m&sup3;
            of crude oil was released within the secondary containment of
            Tank&nbsp;121. At 06:50&nbsp;PST a TMPU operator arrived on site,
            discovered the rele<sup id="fn1-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a
              ></sup
            >ase and closed the Tank&nbsp;121 roof drain valve to stop the
            release. The company incident response was initiated and an Incident
            Command Post (ICP) was established at the nearby Sumas Pump Station.
            The NEB was notified &nbsp; 08:16. Soon after receiving the
            notification, the NEB’s Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was
            activated. NEB staff arrived at the TMPU ICP at&nbsp;17:00 on
            24&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012. The emergency phase of the incident was
            terminated at&nbsp;12:50 on 25&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012 when the last
            free oil was removed from the secondary containment. No one was
            injured during the incident and environmental consequences were
            limited to the contamination of the secondary containment gravel and
            air emissions. The secondary containment liner prevented the oil
            from migrating outside the secondary containment. Figure&nbsp;1
            shows the oil release in the secondary containment of Tank&nbsp;121
            after most of the free oil had been recovered. A foam blanket covers
            the remaining oil and the darkened gravel shows the original extent
            of the spill.

            3.2 Sequence of Events Leading to the Discovery of the Spill
          </h3>
          <p>
            According to TMPU’s Investigation Report, for several consecutive
            days prior to the incident, the Abbotsford area experienced
            unusually cold weather conditions, with temperatures reaching a low
            point on 18 January with a temperature of -14.8&nbsp;°C. During that
            period, Tank&nbsp;121 was inactive and the crude oil level was at a
            low operating level of 1.2&nbsp;metres. For five and a half days,
            the temperature of the crude oil fell below zero degrees Celsius,
            varying between 0&nbsp;°C and -1.7&nbsp;°C. On
            23&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012, between the hours of&nbsp;20:37
            and&nbsp;22:26, Tank&nbsp;121 received a scheduled delivery of
            3400&nbsp;m&nbsp; of crude oil. During this receipt of oil, the
            level of oil increased from&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;m to&nbsp;7.0&nbsp;m and
            the temperature of the crude oil in the tank increased
            from&nbsp;-0.1&nbsp; °C to&nbsp;9.7&nbsp;°C.
          </p>
          <p>
            Via a SCADA System, the Sumas tanks are monitored 24&nbsp;hours,
            seven days a week by TMPU’s Control Centre in Edmonton, AB. The
            SCADA system is monitored by a CCO. The SCADA log for Tank&nbsp;121
            recorded the following events the night of the incident:

            Air monitoring was conducted throughout the response. TMPU’s
            personnel were assigned to monitor air quality (LEL, O<sub>2</sub>,
            H<sub>2</sub>S, benzene and total volatile organic compounds (VOCs))
            adjacent to the containment area as well as around the perimeter of

            and provided regular field screenings of ambient air in locations
            within the neighborhood surrounding the Sumas Terminal for potential
            contaminants resulting from the release and clean-up of crude oil.
            Eight locations close to residential areas and an elementary school
            were monitored. Data was collected for H<sub>2</sub>S, benzene,
            total VOCs and LEL, as well as O<sub>2</sub>, carbon monoxide, and

          <p>
            In February&nbsp;2012, TMPU emptied and cleaned Tank&nbsp;121 in
            order to enter it and investigate the cause of the failure of the
            tank roof drain system. Representatives of the roof drain system
            vendor were on site for the inspection of the roof drain system. As
            shown in Figure&nbsp;2 below, the Tank&nbsp;121 roof drain system is
            a Pivot Master-type drain system made of a sump attached to the
            floating roof and steel pipes with flexible joints to carry the roof
            accumulated water down through and out at the bottom of the tank. A
            drain valve located just outside the tank wall on the roof drain
            system allows the water to drain into the secondary containment when
            open.

          <p>
            TPMU visually inspected the roof drain system and identified that
            the leak resulted from a failed gasket located in the flange pair
            indicated by the red arrow in Figure&nbsp;2. This joint was
            disassembled and the failed gasket is shown in Figure&nbsp;3 below.
            TMPU determined that the gasket appeared to have been damaged by
            excessive pressure, likely caused by freezing. TMPU explained in its
            investigation report that the combined effect of the unusually cold
            weather and low level of oil in Tank&nbsp;121 in the two weeks
            preceding the leak may have caused water to freeze in the roof drain
            system (see section&nbsp;3.2 for more details on the weather). TMPU
            indicated that temperature variations throughout the days and within
            the tank are suspected to have caused cycles of water freezing and
            melting on the tank roof and in the roof drain system, which led to
            the accumulation of water and ice in the roof drain system even
            though the roof drain valve was open and the drain sloped to prevent
            water accumulation. The freezing of water in the roof drain system
            would have resulted in excessive internal pressure in the roof drain
            system causing the gasket to fail while preventing the oil from
            leaking outside the roof drain system. Tank&nbsp;121 received the
            3400&nbsp;m&sup3; of oil on 23&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012, thereby
            increasing the temperature of the tank content
            from&nbsp;-0.1&nbsp;°C to 9.7&nbsp;°C. This would have melted the
            ice in the roof drain system and therefore allowed the oil in the
            tank to enter the roof drain system where the gasket was damaged.
            Because the drain valve of the roof drain system was open, the oil
            could then flow into the Tank&nbsp;121 secondary containment.

          <p>
            TMPU has determined that no other factors contributed to the failure
            of the flanged joint aside from excessive pressure resulting from
            ice expansion within the piping system. Also, TMPU confirmed that no
            other damage was identified during the visual inspection of the roof
            drain system of Tank&nbsp;121. The failed gasket was replaced and
            the roof drain system was pressure tested to confirm its integrity
            prior to returning Tank&nbsp;121 to service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tank&nbsp;121, which was built in&nbsp;1963, is inspected according
            to the American Petroleum Institute (API) standard&nbsp;653,<em>
              Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and Reconstruction</em
            >, which is the mandatory inspection standard for steel storage
            tanks as per CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 clause&nbsp;10.9.2.1. Tank&nbsp;121
            was last inspected in&nbsp;1995, at which time the current roof
            drain system was installed. TMPU explained that the gasket, which
            met the American Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
            standard&nbsp;B16.21,
            <em>Non-Metallic Flat Gaskets for Pipe Flanges</em>, and TMPU’s
            <em>Bolted Flange Joint Assembly</em> standard, can be considered as
            highly reliable for this type of application. TMPU confirmed that it
            has not experienced any other roof drain gasket failures on its
            systems.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, based on the following facts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The combination of cold weather (significantly below the freezing
              point)  and of the low level of oil in Tank&nbsp;121 in the days
              preceding the leak resulted in the oil in Tank&nbsp;121 reaching
              temperatures below&nbsp;0°C for more than five days, up until the
              receipt of oil on 23&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012;
            </li>
            <li>
              The leak appeared just after filling the tank with warmer oil
              during the night of&nbsp;23 to 24&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012;
            </li>
            <li>
              The damage to the gasket shown in Figure&nbsp;3 appears to have
              been caused by excessive pressure, as determined by TMPU’s
              investigation;
            </li>
            <li>
              The roof drain system does not normally operate under high
              pressure, the only pressure being the hydrostatic head of liquid
              in the tank or of the water that could accumulate in the roof
              drain system if the valve was closed;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            and because there is no evidence of other possible failure
            mechanisms, the Board agrees with TMPU’s conclusion that the
            mechanism of failure of the roof drain gasket appears to be
            excessive internal pressure caused by freezing of water in the roof
            drain system.

            A factor that contributed to the release of crude oil into the
            Tank&nbsp;121 secondary containment is that the drain valve of the
            roof drain system was open at the time of the incident. The fact
            that the drain valve was open allowed the oil, which could flow
            through the failed gasket of the roof drain system, to enter the
            secondary containment.

            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>
            Due to the high and often intense level of rainfall at the Sumas and
            Burnaby terminals, the roof drain valves were normally kept open to
            allow the water accumulating on the tank roofs to drain continually.
            This practice is different than TMPU’s practice at locations where
            freezing conditions are frequent and where the roof drain systems
            are isolated and winterized to prevent freezing damage. At the
            Burnaby and Sumas terminals, the significant rainfalls of the milder
            winters require these roof drain systems to be operational year
            round.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, prior to this incident, TMPU had identified the need
            to change its procedure regarding the drain valve position. On
            24&nbsp;November&nbsp;2011, a Facility Modification Request change
            management procedure was initiated to change TMPU’s procedure for
            water removal from external floating roofs to require the roof drain
            valves at these locations to be kept normally closed. This change
            would require more time and attention from terminal staff to manage
            the rain water accumulation, but it would also provide protection
            against a roof drain failure. The change was approved by TMPU on
            1&nbsp;December&nbsp;2011. A work order was issued on
            12&nbsp;December&nbsp;2011 to update the procedure and was completed
            on the same day. However, this change to the procedure was not
            formally communicated to field personnel. TMPU indicated that
            normally an email notification is made to inform the key
            stakeholders of the revisions made to a procedure, but this was not
            completed for this change. Even though the Sumas Terminal field
            supervisor was aware the procedure was being considered for change,
            he was not advised that the change had been made and, therefore,
            field staff continued to keep the roof drain valve normally open as
            per the previous procedure. Neither the Facility Modification
            Request change management procedure, nor the work order process in
            place at that time, required that field personnel be notified of the
            procedural change. The process that TMPU used to manage the change
            to the roof drain valve position was inadequate because it did not
            have a requirement for ensuring that the change would be
            communicated to field personnel, who were directly affected by such
            a change. In addition, the fact that TMPU’s field personnel were not
            informed of the new procedure is a non-compliance with the
            <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations 1999</em> (OPR-99) section&nbsp;28,
            which states:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >“A company shall inform all persons associated with operation
              activities on the pipeline of the practices and procedures to be
              followed and make available to them the relevant portions of the
              operation and maintenance manuals.”</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            It is reasonable to expect that field staff should have been
            informed of the change shortly after 12&nbsp;December&nbsp;2011 and
            that the new procedure would have been implemented before the
            incident occurred.

            4.3.1 CCO Activation of and Response to the Creep Alarms
          </h4>
          <p>
            A factor that contributed to the amount of crude oil released into
            the Tank&nbsp;121 secondary containment area is that the leak was
            not detected as quickly as it should have been. A first operational
            error  happened when the CCO, who was monitoring the Sumas Terminal
            during the night shift at TMPU’s control centre in Edmonton, did not
            set the creep alarm on the Legacy System within 15&nbsp;minutes
            after completing the receipt of crude oil into Tank&nbsp;121 as per
            TMPU’s procedure&nbsp;<em>5.2 SCADA System Creep Alarms</em>. The
            operator did set the creep alarm on the Test System right after
            completing the receipt into Tank&nbsp;121, but TMPU’s verbal
            instructions were that the Legacy System was to remain the basis for
            operations until the transition to the new Test System was
            completed. The CCOs were to familiarize themselves with the new
            system, and when comfortable, begin issuing duplicate commands on
            the new system to confirm operational consistency with the Legacy
            System. The night shift CCO set the creep alarm on the Legacy System
            at 01:11 on 24&nbsp;January, 2hr&nbsp;45&nbsp;min after completing
            the receipt of crude oil at Tank&nbsp;121, which happened
            at&nbsp;22:26 on 23&nbsp;January.

            The night shift CCO failed to follow TMPU’s procedures by not
            setting the creep alarm on the Legacy System within 15&nbsp;minutes
            of completing the receipt of crude oil in Tank&nbsp;121. This is a
            non-compliance with subsection&nbsp;4(2) of the OPR-99, which
            states:

                Tank&nbsp;121. The fact that the CCO did not follow TMPU’s
                procedures is a non-compliance with the OPR-99

          <p>
            As described in section&nbsp;3.2, the night shift CCO received three
            alarms, two from the Legacy System and one from the Test System,
            between 02:39 and 04:11. Each time, the night shift CCO failed to
            recognize the possible leak situation when viewing the Tank&nbsp;121
            volume trend. <a href="#nnx2">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> shows the
            Tank&nbsp;121 level and volume trends and, at 02:39, when the night
            shift CCO received the first alarm, the level and volume trends show
            a noticeable drop of level and volume from the time the receipt of
            oil was completed. The night shift CCO had access to both the volume
            and level trends for the Tank&nbsp;121, which both show similar
            trends, but the night shift CCO only viewed the volume trends from
            the Legacy and Test systems. TMPU indicated that the volume trend
            was adequately displayed and the night shift CCO did notice the
            trend but, considering the initial volume change as relatively
            small, the night shift CCO interpreted the cause as a weather event,
            not a possible leak. The night shift CCO also had access to the
            analog (number) value information for the level or volume of
            Tank&nbsp;121, but the night shift CCO did not use this information.
            The SCADA settings allow a change to be made to the volume scale to
            make it more pronounced, however this scaling feature was not used
            by the night shift CCO.

            The night shift CCO again failed to follow TMPU’s procedures by
            deciding that the alarms were false alarms, without sending a field
            technician to verify on site. TMPU’s procedure&nbsp;2.2.3.5&nbsp;<em
              >Unexpected Tank Level Deviation</em
            >
            requires that a level deviation that can’t be explained as normal
            operations must be investigated by a field technician. In this case,
            the CCO assumed the creep alarms, which are a notification of a tank
            level deviation, were caused by high winds but he did not send a
            field technician to investigate. TMPU confirmed that high winds are
            a potential cause for false creep alarms but that this situation is
            not known to be a normal operating condition. TMPU has no
            instrumentation to measure and record wind information at the Sumas
            Terminal and the CCO had therefore no ability to determine the wind
            conditions at the Sumas Terminal without having someone verify on
            site. If the night shift CCO had followed TMPU’s
            procedure&nbsp;2.2.3.5 <em>Unexpected Tank Level Deviation</em>, the
            leak could have been stopped earlier as a technician would have been
            sent on site after the first alarm.

                the tank levels to determine the cause of the creep alarms which
                could not be explained by normal operations. The fact that the
                CCO did not follow TMPU’s procedures is a non-compliance with

            The three operational errors described in Findings&nbsp;4, 5
            and&nbsp;6 contributed to a higher volume of crude oil being
            released into the Tank&nbsp;121 secondary containment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The night shift CCO had been qualified in this position since
            June&nbsp;2011. TMPU confirmed that the CCO had completed all the
            required training and training records were provided confirming the
            CCO had been trained on the 5.2&nbsp;<em
              >SCADA System Creep Alarm</em
            >s and 2.2.3.5 <em>Unexpected Tank Level Deviation</em> procedures.
            The training records indicate that, in January&nbsp;2011, the night
            shift CCO completed a first<em> Job Check</em> on
            procedures&nbsp;5.2 and&nbsp;2.2.3.5, which is an evaluation by a
            qualified CCO or the Supervisor, Control Centre Procedures and
            Training (CCP&amp;T) that the CCO being trained understands each
            step of the procedure. A second <em>Job Check</em> was completed in
            June&nbsp;2011 prior to completion of the test required for
            qualifying the CCO to operate the Sumas control desk. The test
            records show that the night shift CCO successfully answered the test
            questions related the TMPU’s procedures&nbsp;5.2 and&nbsp;2.2.3.5.
            One of the test questions was on the requirement to have a field
            technician investigate a tank level deviation that can’t be
            explained as normal operations and the night shift CCO had properly
            answered the questions. The first and second
            <em>Job Check</em> evaluations and the final qualification
            verification were completed by the Supervisor CCP&amp;T.

            4.3.2 Creep Alarm Threshold Value on the Test System
          </h4>
          <p>
            Another factor that may have contributed to the late leak detection
            is that the threshold value for the creep alarm on the Test System
            was not set at the proper volume deviation value. The creep alarm on
            the Test System was set to alarm for a change in level of 100
            millimeters, which corresponds to a volume deviation of
            59&nbsp;m&sup3;. The creep alarm should have been triggered by a
            volume deviation of 10&nbsp;m&sup3;, which is a level change of
            17&nbsp;mm. The 100&nbsp;mm threshold for triggering the creep alarm
            was a default value in the Test System. CCOs were able to modify
            this threshold, but it was not modified by the night shift CCO to
            the right value. TMPU’s investigation report revealed that the night
            shift CCO was unaware of the different creep alarm threshold on the
            Test System. If the creep alarm threshold on the Test System had
            been set to the right value, it would have triggered alarms prior to
            the initial alarm that came from the Legacy System. The fact that
            the Test System, which the night shift CCO was relying on for 2hr 45
            min prior to setting the Legacy System, had not triggered any alarms
            prior to the Legacy System initial alarm was potentially confusing
            information for the night shift CCO to assess. This may have
            contributed to the decision by the CCO to consider the alarms as
            false. TMPU concluded in its investigation report that the<em>
              “CCO application of and response to the creep alarms... was
              compounded by the basis error for the creep alarm in the test
              system”</em

            now normally kept closed (see Corrective Action&nbsp;2), would
            contain the crude oil in the internal components of the roof drain

            TMPU indicated that this incident will not result in changes to its

              conditions, the development and testing of a Programmable Logic
              Controller (PLC) based algorithm for detecting abnormal tank level
              deviations (while filtering out false indications), and the
              clarification of CCO instructions for initiating a field
              investigation if an unexplained tank volume loss alarm should

          <h2 id="s5">Chapter&nbsp;5 - Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB requires regulated companies to develop and implement
            management systems that set out policies, processes and procedures
            for the planning and execution of an organization’s core business to
            manage the safety of people and protection of the environment. The
            NEB investigation revealed that several factors contributed to this
            incident. The mechanism of failure appears to be excessive pressure
            caused by freezing of water in the tank roof drain system. The
            release of 90&nbsp;m&sup3; of crude oil in the secondary containment
            of Tank&nbsp;121 may have been avoided or minimized if TMPU had
            ensured that its change to the drain valve normal position procedure
            had been implemented and if the leak had been detected earlier. If
            appropriate actions had been taken while setting and responding to
            the SCADA system alarms, the leak could have been detected earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB expects companies to demonstrate a commitment to continual
            improvement in safety, security, and environmental protection, and
            in promoting a positive safety culture and strong management
            systems. The Board is satisfied that TMPU’s corrective actions are
            appropriate to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the
            future. The Board will conduct compliance verification activities to
            verify that all the corrective actions identified in this
            investigation report are properly implemented by TMPU.

                  and the creep alarm of the Test System was triggered by a
                  volume deviation of 59&nbsp;m&sup3; (or
                  100&nbsp;mm&nbsp;displacement). This is discussed in more
                  detail in Section&nbsp;4.3.

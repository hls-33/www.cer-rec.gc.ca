            Through its investigation, the Board identified several immediate
            and underlying root causes that contributed to the accident and
            determined actions to be implemented by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. to
            address the causes. All Companies should note these immediate and
            root causes and the actions required to deal with them, as described
            in the Investigation Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Companies should continue to examine their health and safety
            programs to ensure that their programs meet the requirements of the
            <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations - 1999</em>, the
            <em>Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II</em> and other applicable
            standards in order to protect employees from injury and promote a
            safe work place and strong safety culture.

          <h2><a id="smmr"></a>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            On 24&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 Mr.&nbsp;Henri&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre, an
            electrician employed by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge), died
            while carrying out electrical work at the Enbridge Kerrobert Pump
            Station near the town of Kerrobert, Saskatchewan. The National
            Energy Board conducted an investigation into this incident under the
            authority of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately following the incident, Enbridge activated its emergency
            response procedures. The Board considers that the Enbridge response
            was quick, appropriate and effective for the nature of the incident
            and it demonstrated the effectiveness of the emergency training
            received by the Enbridge and Power Comm Inc. staff that were on-site
            at the time of the incident. The Board has no concerns about the
            emergency response conducted for this incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes the Final Autopsy Report and Final Toxicology
            Results dated 24&nbsp;June&nbsp;2008 from the Saskatchewan Ministry
            of Justice and Attorney General Office of the Chief Coroner
            (Saskatchewan Coroner). The Saskatchewan Coroner opines that contact
            with high voltage electricity, as reported in the case of
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre, would result in essentially instantaneous
            cardiac arrest. Following the incident, Enbridge filed with the
            Board two summaries prepared by a medical expert retained by
            Enbridge. The summaries raise question as to the cause of death of
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and suggest that it may not have been the
            result of electrocution, as opined in the Saskatchewan Coroners
            report.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, the Board notes that the sequence of events leading up
            to the incident reveal several immediate errors that were committed
            prior to the incident, and the investigation revealed that there
            were several underlying root causes present in the Enbridge safety
            management system prior to the incident. These immediate and root
            causes had the effect of placing Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre in a
            situation that put his personal safety at great risk immediately
            prior to his death. Where this report makes reference to the
            incident, it refers to the hazardous conditions to which
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was exposed immediately prior to his death
            but does not infer or conclude as to the cause of death. Other
            factors, while not considered to be immediate or underlying root
            causes, nonetheless contributed to the cause of the incident and are
            discussed below.
          </p>
          <p>The immediate causes related to this incident include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No pre-job safety meeting was conducted by
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre or others involved with the work, as
              required by Enbridge Operations and Maintenance procedures.
            </li>
            <li>
              No hazard assessment of the work was conducted, and therefore no
              assessment of the need for a safe work permit or task analysis was
              done.
            </li>
            <li>
              No Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance form was completed as
              required by Enbridge Operations and Maintenance procedures.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre stood in front of the wrong power factor
              capacitor cell door when he asked Mr.&nbsp;Halter to unlock the
              door.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre entered the cell prior to Mr.&nbsp;Halter
              being able to correctly test the high voltage probe and sweep the
              inside of the cell.
            </li>
            <li>
              There was poor communication between Mr.&nbsp;Halter and
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was not wearing the required personal
              protective equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter lacked situational
              awareness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre did not conduct a flash test with a hot
              stick prior to entering the cell or use a hot stick to apply the
              safety grounds as required by the Enbridge Operations and
              Maintenance procedures.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The underlying root causes related to this incident include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Hazard/Risk Category assigned by Enbridge to the power factor
              capacitor cells corresponds to a lower level of personal
              protective equipment than required in order to protect personnel
              from being injured from an arc flash.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hazard assessment, safe work permit and task analysis
              procedures were not consistently applied or clearly understood by
              the Enbridge workers involved in this incident.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance forms filed by
              Enbridge show that the form is not consistently applied or clearly
              understood by the Enbridge workers who completed the forms,
              including those workers involved in this incident.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a lack of safety culture and awareness among the workers
              involved in this incident.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are weaknesses in the Enbridge safety training program
              provided to the workers involved in this incident.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is an inconsistent knowledge and practice among the Enbridge
              workers involved in this incident on the required personal
              protective equipment for electrical work.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other contributing factors include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The design of the 4-ESB-1 electrical switchgear building, while
              meeting the <em>Canadian Electrical Code</em> design standards,
              provides limited visual guidance between corresponding motor
              starter cabinets and power factor capacitor cells and does not
              provide for interlocks between them.
            </li>

          <h2 id="s1">1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            On 24&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 Mr.&nbsp;Henri&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre, an
            electrician employed by Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge), died
            while conducting electrical work at the Enbridge Kerrobert Pump
            Station near the town of Kerrobert, Saskatchewan. The death was
            reported by Enbridge to the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) and
            the TSB contacted the National Energy Board (Board or NEB). The NEB
            subsequently deployed two investigators to the Kerrobert Pump
            Station to conduct concurrent investigations under the
            <em>National Energy Board Ac</em> (NEB Act or Act) and under the
            Canada Labour Code (CLC). This report presents the evidence,
            analysis, findings and recommendations of the investigation
            conducted under the NEB Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the evidence strongly supports the argument that
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre made contact with electricity, the Board
            does not make this determination, recognizing that no witness saw
            him make contact. The facts remain however, that the failures in the
            Enbridge management system&nbsp;placed Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre in a
            very hazardous situation, with a very high potential for making
            contact with electricity and&nbsp;for receiving serious injury or
            the loss of his life. Where this report makes reference to the
            incident, it refers to the hazardous conditions to which
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was exposed immediately prior to his death
            but does not infer or conclude as to the cause of death.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The scope of the NEB investigation into this incident was restricted
            to the Board's mandate as set out in the NEB Act. A concurrent
            investigation was conducted pursuant to the CLC by a NEB staff
            member designated as a Health and Safety Officer under the CLC. The
            NEB staff members conducting the concurrent investigations jointly
            gathered evidence and conducted site visits and interviews related
            to the incident. However, the analysis of the evidence,
            determination of findings and recommendations were conducted
            independently pursuant to the provisions of the respective
            legislation. While reference is made in this report to certain
            requirements of the CLC, no analysis, findings or recommendations
            are made pursuant to that legislation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain sections of the NEB Act set out the authority of the Board
            to inquire into any incident and to make regulations as to safety.
            section&nbsp;12 of the NEB Act sets out the jurisdiction of the

            and then with Enbridge personnel in attendance, inspected the
            incident site within the 4-ESB-1 electrical switchgear building
            (4-ESB-1). Photographs were taken inside the 4-ESB-1, some of which
            are included in this report. Investigators also conducted interviews
            with witnesses who were inside the 4-ESB-1 at the time of the

            Mr.&nbsp;Art&nbsp;Nordholm, an investigator from the Transportation
            Safety Board (TSB), was also in attendance at the pump station on
            25&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008. After a preliminary assessment of the facts
            surrounding this incident, the TSB determined that it would not
            conduct an investigation since the incident appeared to be related
            to occupational safety and health issues and not to a systemic
            problem posing a threat to public safety, property or the
            environment. The NEB was therefore able to conduct a full
            investigation pursuant to the NEB Act.<sup id="fn1-rf"

            investigation methodology. The DNV loss causation model shows that
            incidents typically do not occur as a result of one clear factor,
            but are the result of multiple factors and underlying latent
            conditions. An incident event will most often occur because of lack
            of control, underlying root causes and immediate causes which lead
            to the incident and result in unintended harm or damage
            (DNV,&nbsp;2003). The loss causation model was used to guide the NEB
            investigation towards identification of the factors that contributed
            to the incident and what must be done to control the causes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The analysis of the evidence related to the incident was further
            guided by use of the DNV systematic causal analysis technique. The
            DNV systematic causal analysis technique is a method of examination
            and processing of evidence which leads to identification of problems
            and their significance, and the development of appropriate remedial
            measures. The analysis is based on the facts of the incident and,
            where appropriate, on reasonable assumption. The analysis is
            iterative as the evidence is refined and tested. The DNV causal
            analysis of the evidence is presented in table format in
            Appendix&nbsp;II.

          <h2 id="s5">5. The Incident</h2>
          <p>
            The Enbridge Southern Access Expansion project stages&nbsp;2A
            and&nbsp;2B (Project) were approved by Board
            Order&nbsp;XO-E101-01-2007 on 25&nbsp;January&nbsp;2007. The Project
            includes the upgrade of four mainline pumps and the addition of one
            booster pump at the Enbridge Kerrobert pump station. As part of the
            Kerrobert station pump upgrades, the Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 pump was to be
            replaced by a unit with higher horsepower. Prior to removing the
            Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 pump, it first needed to be electrically isolated by
            racking out (switching off) the unit from the 4160&nbsp;volt power
            supply and then grounding to eliminate any residual electricity that
            may be present in the unit. Prior to racking out, the electrical
            equipment within any of the power factor capacitor cells in use in
            4-ESB-1 would be electrically live, carrying 4160&nbsp;volts.
            Racking out and grounding was to be conducted by Enbridge
            electricians on 24&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 from within building
            4-ESB-1.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 24&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 prior to Enbridge personnel and
            contractors beginning work for the day, Enbridge personnel and
            contractors conducted a morning meeting at the Enbridge Kerrobert
            pump station in order to discuss the work schedule and assignments
            for the week. Mr.&nbsp;Halter and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre were
            present at the meeting. Mr.&nbsp;Halter was originally scheduled to
            go to Herschel station however, the Maintenance Coordinator asked
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter to rack out Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 for a planned outage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approximately&nbsp;15 to 20&nbsp;minutes after the morning meeting
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter was in building 4-ESB-1 where he confirmed that pump
            Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 was placed on local control. Mr.&nbsp;Halter then
            racked out and placed a lock on the unit starter for pump
            Unit&nbsp;4-U-3, thereby electrically isolating Unit&nbsp;4-U-3,
            including the Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 power factor capacitor cell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter left building 4-ESB-1 and proceeded towards the
            storage shed in order to locate a set of safety grounds. He met with
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre outside building 4-ESB-1 where
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre had indicated that he too had been unable
            to locate grounding cables but that he had found a set that would
            suffice for the grounding work to be done inside building 4-ESB-1.
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre then entered building
            4-ESB-1 where they quickly located grounding cables lying on the
            floor in a corner of the building. Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre picked
            up the grounding cables and they both went to the row of power
            factor capacitor cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter commenced a test of the high voltage probe that was
            to be used to sweep the inside of the Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 power factor
            capacitor cell to check for the presence of electrical energy. The
            sweep is a safety precaution taken before conducting any work within
            the cell. The voltage probe test involves turning the probe on,
            setting the appropriate voltage level on the probe, and then holding
            it in close proximity to a known energized electrical source, in
            this case the overhead fluorescent lighting (photo&nbsp;5.2). The
            probe detects the electric field surrounding the alternating current
            potential. A successful test of the probe results in a constant
            audible alarm tone being emitted from the probe while it is held
            near the known energized source. As the probe is moved away from the
            known energized source, the constant alarm tone will change to an
            intermittent tone. If no electrical energy is present, the probe
            will emit an intermittent tone throughout the test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter stated to Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre that he was
            having difficulty with the test of the voltage probe.
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre stood in front of a power factor capacitor
            cell door and as he was still holding the cables he asked
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter to unlock the door. Mr.&nbsp;Halter unlocked the
            door that Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was standing in front of, and
            resumed his test of the voltage probe. Mr.&nbsp;Halter could not
            obtain the appropriate audible tone from the probe and he indicated
            this to Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre. In his statement Mr.&nbsp;Halter
            said &quot;I continued to test the high voltage tester. I held it up
            to a light, it did not alarm. Henri opened the door. I told him the
            high voltage tester was not picking up the light.&quot;
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre acknowledged Mr.&nbsp;Halter by giving him
            &quot;a look&quot; (statement of Mr.&nbsp;Halter dated
            25&nbsp;March,&nbsp;2008).
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre then opened the unlocked power factor
            capacitor cell door. Mr.&nbsp;Halter did a sweep inside the cell
            with the voltage probe which did not emit the appropriate signal
            indicating the presence of electrical energy. Mr.&nbsp;Halter then
            proceeded to turn his back to Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre in order to
            continue testing the probe by holding it up to the overhead
            lighting. Mr.&nbsp;Halter did not expect that
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre would enter the cell. In his statement to
            the NEB investigators Mr.&nbsp;Halter said &quot;I heard an arc,
            just a quick buzz and saw Henri back out and looked like he had the
            wind knocked out of him.&quot;&nbsp; In his statement to the RCMP
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter said &quot;I did not see Henri enter the cell, I
            just heard the arc&quot;. In his written statement
            Mr.&nbsp;Ron&nbsp;Grove said &quot;I heard a bang and turned around.
            The Enbridge employee staggered back from the equipment&quot;. In
            his interview statement to the NEB investigators
            Mr.&nbsp;Ron&nbsp;Grove said he &quot;had his back turned and didn't
            see anything, heard the bang, an out of the ordinary sound&quot;. In
            his interview statement to the NEB investigators
            Mr.&nbsp;Graham&nbsp;Taylor said &quot;could see their heads and see
            them checking for voltage and heard the bang/pop and smelled smoke
            and saw the cell door hit, like Henri walked into it&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            After hearing the arc, Mr.&nbsp;Halter turned to face
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre. Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre stood away from
            the cell briefly, then fell to one knee and collapsed. One part of
            the grounding cables was inside the cell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately after Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre collapsed,
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter and other Enbridge and Power Comm employees
            initiated an emergency response. Mr.&nbsp;Halter immediately moved
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre to a safe location away from the power
            factor capacitor cell and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation
            (CPR). A Power Comm worker shouted &quot;man down&quot;, a phone
            call was made to 911, the station alarm was sounded, workers were
            evacuated to muster points and the local emergency services arrived
            within approximately 25&nbsp;minutes of Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre
            being injured. When other Enbridge staff entered the 4-ESB-1
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter noticed that the door to Unit&nbsp;4-U-2 power
            factor capacitor cell was open, and not the door to Unit&nbsp;4-U-3.
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter then made the scene safe for the emergency
            responders by calling the control centre to shut off power from
            Unit&nbsp;4-U-2, racking out the starter for Unit&nbsp;4-U-2,
            donning safety gloves, removing part of the grounding cable from
            Unit&nbsp;4-U-2 and closing the door to Unit&nbsp;4-U-2.

            The table provided in Appendix&nbsp;III outlines the sequence of
            events leading up to the incident and the response actions
            immediately following the incident, as based on the evidence
            gathered from the investigation.

          <h3 id="s5_1">5.1. Post-Incident Site Observations</h3>
          <p>
            The Board notes that the emergency response actions of the Enbridge
            and Power Comm staff involved in the incident was conducted
            generally in accordance with the Enbridge emergency response
            procedures. The Board considers that the response was quick,
            appropriate and effective for the nature of the incident and it
            demonstrated the effectiveness of the emergency training received by
            the Enbridge and Power Comm staff. The Board has no concerns about
            the emergency response for this incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            The investigators conducted a site visit with Enbridge personnel
            wherein several photographs of the scene were taken. Several of
            these photographs are provided here to assist in clarifying the
            events leading up to the incident.

            Photo&nbsp;5.4 shows the inside of power factor capacitor
            cell&nbsp;4-U-2. The metal bus bars are labeled A, B and C. After
            racking out the unit, grounding is accomplished by connecting the
            three tail ends of the grounding cables to the three bus bars and
            then the lead end of the grounding cables to a ground point.

          </h4>
          <h5 id="s6_1_1_1">6.1.1.1. Hazard Assessment</h5>
          <p>
            The Enbridge Operating and Maintenance Procedures Book&nbsp;2 Safety
            (Book&nbsp;2) tab&nbsp;3 sets out the company requirements for
            conducting a hazard assessment and completion of a safe work permit
            for work activities at facilities and on the right-of-way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Book&nbsp;2 states that before work begins regions are responsible
            for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensuring affected workers are trained in:
              <ul class="lst-lwr-alph ">
                <li>hazard identification and assessment; and</li>
                <li>
                  selection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE);
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Conducting a risk assessment of the work activity;</li>
            <li>
              Where reasonably practicable, involving all workers associated
              with the work activity in the risk assessment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As described in Book&nbsp;2, the hazard assessment process includes
            the following steps. A risk rating is determined using Figure&nbsp;1
            Book&nbsp;2 -03-02-01 page&nbsp;6-7. If the risk rating is
            determined to be less than 4, the risk is considered low and the
            task may be completed immediately. A risk rating of 4 to 16 is
            considered high and a safe work permit must be completed for the
            work prior to the task being undertaken. Where a safe work permit is
            required, it is to be completed prior to commencement of the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Book&nbsp;2 requires that hazard assessments must be performed for
            all high risk activities and must be documented through the
            completion of a safe work permit; exemptions must be approved by the
            regional manager at their discretion (Book&nbsp;2, 03-02-01,
            page&nbsp;2-7).
          </p>
          <p>
            Book&nbsp;2 also states that the safe work permit is verification
            that a hazard assessment has been completed and that permit
            approvers and issuers must not approve or issue any safe work permit
            until the scope of the work has been (a)&nbsp;defined in sufficient
            detail to ensure all hazards are identified and controlled, and
            (b)&nbsp;reviewed with the permit issuer for accuracy, and all
            potential hazards and controls have been identified. The permit
            receiver is responsible for reviewing hazards and controls with
            affected workers and ensuring requirements on the permit are
            followed.

          <h5><a id="s6_1_1_2"></a>6.1.1.2. Lockout</h5>
          <p>
            Enbridge Book&nbsp;2, 06-03-01 indicates that lockout is required
            when there is a risk of unexpected release of stored energy, be it
            electrical, mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic. The standard
            procedures are as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Identify and locate all potential energy sources to be isolated
            </li>
            <li>Notify affected workers</li>
            <li>Shut down operating equipment</li>
            <li>
              Isolate equipment from its energy source by operating the switch,
              valve or other energy isolating device
            </li>
            <li>
              Relieve, disconnect or restrain potentially hazardous stored or
              residual energy
            </li>
            <li>Lock and tag the equipment</li>
            <li>
              Verify the lockout by confirming that energy sources have been
              isolated and locked out
            </li>
            <li>Proceed with maintenance.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If the lockout involves electrical equipment, use the Electrical
            Equipment Isolation/Clearance form where required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge Book&nbsp;2, 07-03-02 also includes steps for lock and tag
            of High Voltage Equipment. Under the Unit Motor/Unit Pump procedure
            (page&nbsp;7-8), step&nbsp;7 requires a lock and tag upon isolation
            of the high voltage equipment.
          </p>
          <h5><a id="s6_1_1_3"></a>6.1.1.3. Electrical Safety</h5>
          <p>
            For high voltage work Book&nbsp;2 requires that a pre-job meeting be
            conducted to review potential hazards associated with the work, work
            procedures, personal protective equipment and safe clearance
            distances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Book&nbsp;2, tab&nbsp;7 Electrical Safety provides a standard
            procedure for de-energizing or switching high voltage equipment and
            several specific procedures for work on various pumps and other
            electrical equipment. For the racking out and grounding of
            Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 the standard procedure and the Unit Motor/Unit Pump
            procedure would apply (Mr.&nbsp;Veronelly interview). The Standard
            procedure sets out the following numbered steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Complete the Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance form.</li>
            <li>Coordinate pending power shutdown with affected users.</li>
            <li>Review what circuits or cutouts will be switched.</li>
            <li>Review what circuits or cutouts will be locked out.</li>
            <li>
              Identify potential hazards located near the work area (make a
              single line sketch of the circuit if one is not available.).
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure all onsite personnel involved in the work sign the form.

            In its Operations and Maintenance Procedures, Enbridge has adopted
            the NFPA&nbsp;70E as the standard for electrical safety that it will
            apply to electrical work on its system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Article&nbsp;130 and Annex&nbsp;D of NFPA 70E provides for Flash
            Hazard Analysis and calculation of the Flash Protection Boundaries
            and incident energy for electrical equipment and tasks. Table
            130.7(C)(9)(a) of NFPA 70E outlines Hazard/Risk Category (HRC)
            classifications for various tasks conducted on electrical equipment.
            The HRC classifications are then applied in Table&nbsp;130.7(C)(10)
            to determine the appropriate PPE to be worn while conducting tasks
            on electrical equipment. The task of applying safety grounds ranges
            from classification HRC-2 for 600&nbsp;volt class switchgear to
            HRC-4 for metal clad switchgear, 1 kilovolt (kv) and above, assuming
            the equipment is energized and work is done within the flash
            protection boundary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Table&nbsp;130.7(C)(10) of NFPA 70E requires that, when working on

            will include long sleeve non-melting shirt and pants and safety
            glasses. However, voltage rated gloves are not required to be worn.
            HRC-2 to HRC-4 requires that leather gloves be worn as well as the
            use of other high voltage protective equipment over and above that
            required for HRC-0.

          <p>
            The <em>Canadian Electrical Code CAN/CSA&nbsp;C-22</em> sets the
            standard for the installation and proper maintenance of electrical
            equipment in Canada. Given that the work underway by
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter at the time of the
            incident was not related to new electrical installation or
            maintenance, the
            <em>Canadian Electrical Code CAN/CSA&nbsp;C-22</em> does not apply.
            However, the standard did apply to the original design and
            installation of the panel boards and equipment at the Enbridge
            Kerrobert station, and will apply to any future maintenance or

          <h2 id="s7">7. Analysis of Evidence</h2>
          <p>
            Examination of the evidence gathered shows that immediate causes and
            unsafe acts occurred immediately preceding the incident, and root
            causes (underlying conditions, lack of control and management system
            causes) were present prior to the incident occurring. Further, other
            factors were present that, while not considered to be either
            immediate or root causes, nonetheless had a role in contributing to
            the incident. The following is a discussion of the immediate and
            root causes identified through the causal analysis presented in
            Appendix&nbsp;II and a discussion of other contributing factors to
            the incident.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s7_1"></a>7.1 Immediate Causes</h3>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_1"></a>7.1.1. Pre-job Safety Meeting</h4>
          <p>
            A pre-job safety meeting was not conducted by
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter prior to commencing the
            racking out and grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3, as required by
            Book&nbsp;2, tab&nbsp;07-02-02, page&nbsp;1-3. Nor did the morning
            meeting conducted by Enbridge staff address the safety aspects of
            the racking out and grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3. Book&nbsp;2 states
            that the purpose of the pre-job meeting is to review the potential
            hazards, work procedures, PPE and safe clearance distances. Had a
            pre-job meeting been conducted in accordance with the Book&nbsp;2
            requirements, with the participation of both Mr.&nbsp;Halter and
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre, it is reasonable to suppose that potential
            hazards would have been identified, work procedures reviewed, PPE
            identified and safe clearances reviewed.
          </p>
          <h4>
            <a id="s7_1_2"></a>7.1.2. Hazard Assessment, Safe Work Permit and
            Task Analysis
          </h4>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter did not conduct a risk
            assessment of the work activity before commencement of the racking
            out and grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3, as required by Book&nbsp;2,
            tab&nbsp;3. This would have determined a risk rating for the work
            and whether or not a safe work permit would be required. In response
            to IR1-18a Enbridge stated that a formal risk rating was not
            conducted for this activity and that some employees understood that
            a task analysis was required for open system and hot work activities
            but not for what they considered routine tasks such as racking out
            and grounding equipment. The Board notes that since a risk rating
            was not determined, it was not known by Mr.&nbsp;Halter and
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre whether the work was categorized as high
            risk or low risk, and therefore whether or not a safe work permit
            and a task analysis were required to be completed prior to the work
            commencing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although determination of the risk rating would not necessarily have
            resulted in the completion of the safe work permit or task analysis,
            the Board considers that not conducting the risk assessment was an
            unsafe act which reduced the ability of Mr.&nbsp;Halter and
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre to evaluate the risks associated with the
            work and the controls to put in place to address the hazards.
            Further, the Board notes the inconsistent practice and uncertainty
            among the Enbridge employees in the Kerrobert area around the need
            for conducting the risk rating, safe work permit and task analysis.

            <a id="s7_1_3"></a>7.1.3. Electrical Equipment Isolation Clearance
            Form
          </h4>
          <p>
            An Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance Form was not completed
            for the electrical isolation and grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 prior
            to the work commencing, as required by Enbridge Book&nbsp;2,
            tab&nbsp;7 Electrical Safety procedures (Standard, 07-03-01
            page&nbsp;2-8 and Unit Motor/Unit Pump, 07-03-01, page&nbsp;7-8) and
            as required by a written statement on the form itself. The Board
            notes that the Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance Form used by
            Enbridge includes a schematic diagram for planning the work, a box
            for identifying potential hazards near the work area, and a table
            titled &quot;Isolation Procedure Steps&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board finds that had the appropriate sections of the Electrical
            Equipment Isolation/Clearance Form been completed and signed by the
            person in charge of the work prior to the work commencing,
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre would have had a
            greater opportunity to plan the work, identify the steps to be
            taken, identify potential hazards associated with the work area and
            put appropriate controls in place. While it cannot be known if
            completion of the form would have prevented the incident, the Board
            believes that if done, this step would have significantly narrowed
            the potential for an incident to occur.

          <h4>
            <a id="s7_1_4"></a>7.1.4. Unlocking and Opening of Power Factor
            Capacitor Cell
          </h4>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre stood in front of the wrong power factor
            capacitor cell door when he asked Mr.&nbsp;Halter to unlock the
            door. Neither Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre nor Mr.&nbsp;Halter observed
            the door number plate and they did not confirm that they were
            opening the correct power factor capacitor cell. The Board notes
            that by standing in front of the 4-U-2 cell door,
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre provided a visual cue to Mr.&nbsp;Halter
            when he asked Mr.&nbsp;Halter to unlock the door. The Board finds it
            reasonable that Mr.&nbsp;Halter would unlock the door in front of
            which Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was standing. These unsafe acts were
            unintentional errors, unconsciously committed while conducting a
            routine task.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_5"></a>7.1.5. High Voltage Probe</h4>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter was not familiar with the operation of the high
            voltage probe that he used at the time of the incident, and
            therefore was unable to correctly conduct a test of the probe and a
            sweep of the cell. Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre entered the cell with
            the grounding cables prior to receiving confirmation from
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter that the high voltage probe was operating correctly
            and prior to the cell being swept with the probe in its proper
            operating mode. Enbridge provided training to its electricians on
            the types of high voltage probes that it uses, however, this
            training did not include instructions on the correct operation of
            the probes. It was confirmed by Enbridge following the incident that
            the high voltage probe in use by Mr.&nbsp;Halter was in proper
            working order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that Enbridge provided training to Mr.&nbsp;Halter
            and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre in the use of safety equipment such as
            fire extinguishers, respiratory protective equipment, gas detectors,
            PPE and mobile radios. The Board considers a voltage probe to be an
            essential piece of safety equipment, such as those noted above, and
            therefore the proper use of high voltage probes should be included
            in an Enbridge training module. Section&nbsp;46 of the OPR-99
            requires companies to provide training to their employees on
            equipment that they could reasonably be expected to use. The Board
            expects that Enbridge will ensure that training on the correct
            operation of high voltage probes is provided to its employees that
            use the high voltage probes, in accordance with the requirements of
            the&nbsp;OPR-99.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_6"></a>7.1.6. Horizontal Communication</h4>
          <p>
            The evidence shows there was a lack of horizontal communications
            between Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter at the time of
            the incident regarding the use of the high voltage probe.
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter told Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre that the voltage probe
            was not working properly, whereas Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre did not
            verbally respond but gave Mr.&nbsp;Halter &quot;a look&quot;. In his
            statement Mr.&nbsp;Halter said &quot;I continued to test the high
            voltage tester. I held it up to a light, it did not alarm. Henri
            opened the door. I told him the high voltage tester was not picking
            up the light.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a lack of horizontal communications regarding roles and
            the use of PPE. The Enbridge Safety Manual sets out the PPE
            requirements for employees. Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre should have
            been wearing a hard hat in order to be inside the 4-ESB-1 building.
            Further, in his statement to the NEB investigators, Mr.&nbsp;Halter
            said that initially he did not know that Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre
            would be assisting in this job and that he and
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre did not discuss the job. He also stated
            that Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre should have been wearing hard hat,
            safety glasses and gloves. However, Mr.&nbsp;Halter and
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre met outside the 4-ESB-1, they entered the
            4-ESB-1, Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre stood in front of the cell door
            while holding a set of safety grounds, he asked Mr.&nbsp;Halter to
            unlock the door, Mr.&nbsp;Halter unlocked the door,
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre opened the door and Mr.&nbsp;Halter did a
            sweep with the voltage detector. At this point
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was fully participating in the work without
            wearing the minimum required PPE. Although Mr.&nbsp;Halter was
            initially unaware that Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was to assist him
            that day, the grounding task commenced with Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre
            actively assisting, however there was a lack of horizontal
            communication between Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter
            regarding roles and the required PPE. Mr.&nbsp;Halter and the three
            other electricians in the building did not advise
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre to put on the minimum required PPE. The
            Board believes this lack of horizontal communication demonstrates
            the need for a stronger safety culture, where safety is a shared
            responsibility. The responsibility to improve the Enbridge safety
            culture is that of Enbridge.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_7"></a>7.1.7. Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
          <p>
            At the time of the incident Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was not wearing
            the appropriate PPE as required by Book&nbsp;2 procedures, Enbridge
            training requirements, NFPA 70E and as indicated on the warning
            label on the outside of the power factor capacitor cell door. In
            addition to the fire protective clothing that
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was wearing, he should also have been
            wearing safety glasses, hard hat and high voltage gloves. The Board
            notes that in response to IR2-5c, Enbridge included the details of
            the High Voltage Training module that was provided to
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter. The High Voltage
            Training module emphasized the need for and the requirement to wear
            high voltage gloves for applying safety grounds. The evidence also
            indicates that throughout his work history, Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre
            was very diligent about wearing the proper PPE and Enbridge did not
            have reason to be concerned about Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre's
            compliance with requirements for PPE. Therefore, it may never be
            known why Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre did not wear the proper PPE at
            the time of the incident. PPE was Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre's last
            line of defence when all other systems failed.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_8"></a>7.1.8. Lock and Tag</h4>
          <p>
            The procedures require a lock and tag upon electrical isolation of
            high voltage equipment. Also, the lockout/tag out training module
            filed by Enbridge in response to IR1-4k states that a properly
            filled out tag must be used with every lockout and that once the
            equipment is shut down, apply lockout/tag out devices. The Board
            notes that Mr.&nbsp;Halter applied a lock to the Unit&nbsp;4-U-3
            starter but not a tag. This was considered accepted procedure at the
            Kerrobert station for this job as long as the tag was applied prior
            to handover of the work to the contractor and pipeline maintenance
            (PLM). The Board notes the discrepancy between the Book&nbsp;2
            requirements, the training and the adopted procedures at Kerrobert
            and would expect Enbridge to address the discrepancy either by
            enforcement of the Book&nbsp;2 procedures and training, or by
            analysis of the adapted procedure being conducted in the workplace
            and revisions to Book&nbsp;2 and training modules as appropriate. As
            it stands, the acceptance of an ad hoc procedure at the Kerrobert
            station rather than formal amendment of the documented procedure is
            indicative of a malfunctioning safety culture at Kerrobert.

          <h4><a id="s7_1_9"></a>7.1.9. Situational Awareness</h4>
          <p>
            At the time of the incident Mr.&nbsp;Halter and
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre lacked situational awareness. There were a
            series of unsafe conditions that immediately preceded the incident
            that include:&nbsp;
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              Mr.&nbsp;Halter not being able to operate the voltage probe
              correctly.
            </li>
            <li>Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre not wearing appropriate PPE.</li>
            <li>
              Not communicating effectively about the function of the voltage
              probe (Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre giving Mr.&nbsp;Halter &quot;a
              look&quot;) or roles and PPE requirements
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Further, Mr.&nbsp;Halter and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre were likely
            aware of the Book&nbsp;2 procedures for the job that were not being
            followed, including:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>Conduct a pre-job meeting.</li>
            <li>
              Assign a risk rating and, if required, complete a safe work permit
              and task analysis.
            </li>
            <li>Complete an Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance form.</li>
            <li>
              Use a hot stick or conduct a flash test prior to installing the
              grounds.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter had recognized the
            unsafe conditions and the failure to follow procedures as warnings
            that the work situation was becoming increasingly unsafe, they could
            have temporarily suspended the work, re-assessed the grounding task
            and then put the appropriate controls in place to protect themselves
            from injury. The Board concludes that a lack of situational
            awareness contributed to putting Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre's personal
            safety at great risk. The Board considers this to be a safety
            culture issue that could be addressed through leadership and
            awareness training for those involved in this incident.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_10"></a>7.1.10. Other Immediate Causes</h4>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre did not conduct a flash test with a hot
            stick prior to entering the power factor capacitor cell. The Board
            notes that since the incident, a flash test is now included in the
            steps identified in Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance forms
            completed 31&nbsp;March, 1 and 17&nbsp;April.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre did not use &quot;an adequately rated and
            tested hot stick for installing or removing safety ground cables to
            high voltage equipment and conductors&quot; (Book&nbsp;2, 07-02-02,
            Standards, High Voltage Work page&nbsp;1-3 bottom of page). This
            suggests that there was lack of safety awareness and
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was not following safety procedures.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s7_2"></a>7.2. Root Causes</h3>
          <h4><a id="s7_2_1"></a>7.2.1. Design</h4>
          <p>
            The Board notes that Enbridge applies the NFPA 70E Standard for
            determining the appropriate approach boundaries to live parts,
            Hazard/Risk Categories (HRC) and corresponding PPE required to be
            worn for work conducted on or near electrical equipment at its
            facilities. The Board notes that NFPA&nbsp;70E,
            paragraph&nbsp;120.2(A), General, states the following:
          </p>
          <p class="mrgn-lft-md">
            (A) General. All electrical circuit conductors and circuit parts
            shall be considered energized until the source(s) of energy is (are)
            removed, at which time they shall be considered deenergized. All
            electrical circuit conductors and circuit parts shall not be
            considered to be in an electrically safe condition until all sources
            of energy are removed, the disconnecting means is under
            lockout/tagout, the absence of voltage is verified by an approved
            voltage testing device, and, where exposure to energized facilities
            exists, are temporarily grounded. (<em
              >See&nbsp;120.1 for the six-step procedure to establish an
              electrically safe work condition.</em
            >) Electrical conductors and circuit parts that have been
            disconnected, but not under lockout/tagout, tested and grounded
            (where appropriate) shall not be considered to be in an electrically
            safe work condition, and safe work practices appropriate for the
            circuit voltage and energy level shall be used. Lockout/tagout
            requirements shall apply to fixed, permanently installed equipment,
            and to portable equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes the statement that electrical parts that have been
            disconnected, but not under lockout/tagout, tested and grounded
            shall not be considered to be in an electrically safe work
            condition, and safe work practices appropriate for the circuit
            voltage and energy level shall be used. Applying this rule to the
            grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3, the conductors and busbars within
            power factor capacitor cell&nbsp;4-U-3 would not be in an
            electrically safe condition prior to lockout/tagout, voltage testing
            and applying safety grounds to the busbars. This rule also implies
            that appropriate PPE shall be worn for the circuit voltage and
            energy level that may be present before the equipment is in an
            electrically safe condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that Enbridge has assigned flash hazard number HRC-0
            to the power factor capacitor cells in the Enbridge 4-ESB-1 building
            (photograph 5). The Board also notes the requirements of NFPA 170E
            to conduct a Shock Hazard Analysis, a Flash Hazard Analysis and,
            through calculations provided in Annex D, to determine Flash
            Protection Boundaries and incident energy exposure of a worker.
            However, these calculations do not determine a HRC number for flash
            protection. The standard allows for determination of the HRC number
            and PPE requirements using section&nbsp;130.7(C)(9) in lieu of the
            detailed flash hazard analysis approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reviewing the tasks listed in Table&nbsp;130.7(C)(9)(a), the
            Board notes that the HRC for the task of applying safety grounds,
            after a voltage test, ranges from HRC-2 for 600 Volt Class Motor
            Control Centres, to HRC-4 for Metal Clad Switchgear of 1&nbsp;kV and
            above. There are no other tasks listed in Table 130.7(C)(9)(a) that
            correspond to HRC-0 for the task of grounding the busbars in the
            power factor capacitor cells within 4-ESB-1. Using NFPA&nbsp;70E,
            Table&nbsp;130.7(C) (10), HRC-0 requires workers to wear non-melting
            long sleeve shirt and pants, and safety glasses. However, HRC-2 and
            HRC-4 require additional PPE that is not required for HRC-0,
            including, for HRC-4, the use of V-rated gloves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applying the rule that electrical conductors and circuit parts that
            have been disconnected, but not under lockout/tagout, tested and
            grounded (where appropriate) shall not be considered to be in an
            electrically safe work condition, and safe work practices
            appropriate for the circuit voltage and energy level shall be used,
            the Board questions the appropriateness of the HRC-0 assigned by
            Enbridge to the power factor capacitor cells in the 4-ESB-1 for
            flash hazard protection, and the corresponding PPE requirements. The
            Board further questions how Enbridge calculated or otherwise
            determined the HRC-0 for the power factor capacitor cells for flash
            hazard protection. The Board will require follow-up from Enbridge on
            this matter (section&nbsp;10 of the report).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that in addition to the HRC-0 flash hazard indicated
            on the warning labels to the power factor capacitor cells, there is
            reference to Glove Class&nbsp;1. The Board interprets this sign to
            mean that gloves are required to be worn regardless of the PPE
            requirements indicated by HRC-0. The Board finds this may cause
            confusion for workers as the HRC-0 does not require high voltage
            gloves to be worn, but the Glove Class 1 is indicated. The Board
            also notes that the warning label warns specifically against
            &quot;Arc Flash and Shock Hazard&quot;, however, the PPE
            requirements of HRC-0 would not be sufficient to protect against the
            arc flash and shock hazard that may be present within the approach
            boundaries of the cells. The Board will require Enbridge to address
            these inconsistencies in labeling.

            <a id="s7_2_2"></a>7.2.2. Hazard Assessment, Safe Work Permit, Task
            Analysis
          </h4>
          <p>
            Enbridge uses a safe work permit system that was implemented in
            spring of&nbsp;2007. Under this system the work performed by
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre on
            24&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 required that safe work permit procedures be
            followed, and where the risk rating assigned to a task is greater
            than&nbsp;3, a hazard assessment and safe work permit must be
            completed. The Board notes that a risk rating for the work was not
            determined by Mr.&nbsp;Halter and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre prior to
            commencing the racking out and grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3. The
            Board also notes that the risk rating procedure provided in
            Book&nbsp;2 is subjective in nature and may result in either a low
            or high risk rating to be assigned to a job depending on factors
            such as worker experience level and the number of times the worker
            has done the job before.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Enbridge response to IR1-1c the company provided all safe
            work permits completed by Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre from
            1&nbsp;April&nbsp;2007 to 24&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008. The Board notes
            that there are no task analyses included with the safe work permits
            completed by Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre. However, in the Enbridge
            response to IR1-1d, many of the safe work permits completed by other
            electricians include detailed task analyses. The root of this
            inconsistent practice may be found in the hazard awareness training
            module and the Book&nbsp;2 procedures as explained below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hazard Awareness training received by Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre
            on 15&nbsp;June&nbsp;2005 (Enbridge response to AVC dated
            4&nbsp;April&nbsp;2008 and Enbridge response to IR1-4j) provides a
            different set of steps for the hazard assessment process than
            provided in Book&nbsp;2. The training module states that &quot;Work
            with a risk ranking of less than&nbsp;4 is considered low risk; a
            hazard assessment must still be completed to assess the work and
            identify potential hazards before work begins. This includes
            completing a hazard assessment utilizing a Task Analysis to record
            the methods used to control or eliminate the hazards
            identified.&quot; However, Book&nbsp;2, section&nbsp;03-02-01, Safe
            Work Permit - Hazard Assessment, page&nbsp;4-7 states under Risk
            Assessment, item&nbsp;4 &quot;Take action corresponding with the
            risk: For a high risk activity, complete a hazard assessment. For a
            low risk activity, no further action is required.&quot; The updated
            procedure found in Book&nbsp;2 does not include the requirement for
            completion of a task analysis as a tool for conducting a hazard
            assessment prior to performing work with a risk ranking of less
            than&nbsp;4. The Board finds the hazard awareness training and
            Book&nbsp;2 procedures to be inconsistent and should be addressed by
            Enbridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also notes that in response to IR1-2 Enbridge provided
            copies of safe work permits completed at pump stations identified
            for pump upgrade in Board Order&nbsp;XO-E101-01-2007. The Risk
            Assessment Model Ranking (number) is not completed on several of
            these safe work permits, however, the Board notes that the ranking
            must be assigned for all tasks. Also, almost all of the safe work
            permits issued for Kerrobert have a risk ranking of&nbsp;3, which
            according to the Book&nbsp;2 procedures does not require that a safe
            work permit be completed. Whereas almost all the safe work permits
            issued for Herschel and Milden do not have a risk ranking assigned
            at all. This inconsistent completion of the safe work permits
            further indicates that the risk ranking procedure is not fully
            understood and consistently applied by Enbridge workers at these
            stations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The training records filed by Enbridge for Mr.&nbsp;Halter do not
            include the Hazard Awareness training module. However,
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter's records do include a training module for safe work
            permits, which included training in how to complete the safe work
            permit, explanation of hazards and controls and when the permit is
            to be used for hazard assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also notes that in response to IR1-18, Enbridge stated:
            &quot;From interviews with employees it appears that some employees
            understood that a task analysis was required for open system and hot
            work activities but not for what they considered routine tasks such
            as racking and grounding of equipment. Therefore, a formal risk
            rating was not conducted for this specific activity.&quot;
            Book&nbsp;2 procedures however, do not make this distinction and
            state that &quot;Before work begins, regions are responsible for...
            conducting a risk assessment for the work activity&quot;. The Board
            also notes that the Directive issued by Enbridge on
            31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 to all electrical workers and supervisors
            states that high voltage work will be considered a high risk
            activity and a documented hazard assessment is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to IR1-12, Enbridge states that &quot;The racking out
            and grounding of units is a common task which the qualified
            electricians have a great deal of experience with and have performed
            a task analysis on in the past for all future jobs. This task
            analysis was provided to the NEB while on-site after the
            incident.&quot;&nbsp; The Board notes the two task analyses that
            were provided to the investigators on site after the incident and
            which are titled Hazard Analysis Work Sheet, Western Region. The
            hazard analysis work sheet to rack out the unit contactor provided
            by Enbridge lists 4&nbsp;task steps as follows:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              Notify appropriate personnel of intention to remove a specified
              unit from service.
            </li>
            <li>Isolate Unit.</li>
            <li>Wear proper PPE.</li>
            <li>Rack out unit contactor.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The Hazard Analysis Work Sheet for 5 KV Equipment Isolation provided
            by Enbridge lists 6 task steps as follows:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              Notify appropriate personnel of intention o 5KV equipment to be
              isolated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hold pre-job meeting, with all participating groups, to review the
              isolation requirements as per the Single Line Drawing.
            </li>
            <li>Request approval from operators to isolate equipment.</li>
            <li>
              Complete the isolation, and document steps as per the Electrical
              Isolation/Clearance Form. Ensure all required locks and tags are
              in place and all Interlock Keys are collected and stored properly.
              Review Isolation/Clearance form with recipient to ensure he
              understands, then have him sign it before he accepts the document.
            </li>
            <li>
              When work is complete the isolation/clearance form must be
              received from the recipient after verifying that the work is
              complete and is safe to re-energize.
            </li>
            <li>
              Re-energize following the isolation/clearance form procedure.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            While the Hazard Analysis Work Sheet for these tasks appear to be
            detailed enough to lead the worker through the identification of the
            tasks, chances of loss, and control measures, the Board finds that
            since these work sheets are standardized for racking out and
            grounding of units, it is unlikely that the electricians refer to a
            copy of the work sheet each time these jobs are done, particularly
            since some employees understood that a task analysis was required
            for open system and hot work activities but not for what they
            considered routine tasks such as racking and grounding of equipment.
            The Board believes that the intent of the task analysis work sheet
            should be to lead the worker through a step by step identification
            of the tasks and identification and assessment of the hazards of the
            job, before and each time a job is done. This was not done by
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter at the time of the
            incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the Board notes the safe work permit prepared by Jim
            Veronelly on 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008) included the following task
            steps:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">

            The Board notes the focus of Mr&nbsp; Veronelly's safe work permit
            on following correct procedures to ensure that hazard analysis is
            conducted and controls put in place. The Board considers it a good
            example of how a safe work permit should focus on an effective
            hazard assessment for the racking out and grounding tasks, and
            through completion of the safe work permit; the task analysis. The
            Board considers these to be critical steps to safely completing the
            racking out and grounding job and should have been completed by
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter prior to conducting
            their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, the Board notes the deficiencies with the risk rating
            procedures, the inconsistent practice and knowledge around
            completion of a task analysis, the conflicting task analysis
            procedures described in Book&nbsp;2 and in the Western Region Hazard
            Prevention Program training, and the inconsistent completion of the
            safe work permit by Enbridge employees at Kerrobert, Milden and
            Herschel stations. These are significant management system causes
            that were in place prior to the incident and which contributed to
            the placement of Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre in a very hazardous
            situation. The Board considers these matters to be serious
            deficiencies in the hazard analysis and safe work permit process
            that need to be immediately addressed by Enbridge.

            Form
          </h4>
          <p>
            The clearance form includes a hazard assessment, a flow diagram for
            the work, and Isolation Procedures Steps for detailing how the
            electrical isolation would be completed. The Board understands that
            the intent of preparing the Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance
            form prior to commencement of the work is primarily to plan for the
            safe conduct and completion of the job, and to establish and confirm
            a safe state of the electrical switchgear for the transfer of the
            job to the contract electrical workers. The Electrical Equipment
            Isolation/Clearance form was not completed by
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre or Mr.&nbsp;Halter for the racking out and
            grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3. If the appropriate sections of the
            form were completed by Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr., Halter
            prior to commencement of the work, it may have allowed for the step
            by step evaluation and planning of the work procedure and the
            identification and elimination of hazards, as well as serve to
            improve communications between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also notes that in response to IR2-2, Enbridge indicated
            that Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre's main field work site was Cactus Lake
            and that this station had undergone pump upgrades included under
            Board Order XO-E101-01-2007. Enbridge was unable to locate any
            Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance forms completed by
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre for the work conducted at the Cactus Lake
            station and was unable to locate any Electrical Equipment
            Isolation/Clearance forms completed by Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre for
            the time period following 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2007.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes the significant changes since the incident to how
            the Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance form is completed. What
            was previously 3&nbsp;steps (form dated 19&nbsp;November&nbsp;2007
            by Doug Croke for the Herschel Station) to rack out and ground
            the&nbsp;4-U-3, 4160&nbsp;volt contactor, has been expanded
            to&nbsp;13 and 21&nbsp;steps respectively (forms dated
            31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 and 1&nbsp;April&nbsp;2008 by
            Jim&nbsp;Veronelly) to isolate Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 at the Kerrobert
            Station. In the 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 Electrical Equipment
            Isolation/Clearance form the steps included:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>Put on proper PPE for the category of arc flash hazard.</li>

            <li>Use a high voltage detector on a hot stick.</li>
            <li>Connecting safety grounds using proper PPE and hot-stick.</li>
            <li>

          <p>
            In the 1&nbsp;April&nbsp;2008 Electrical Equipment
            Isolation/Clearance form the steps included:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              At this point wear all proper PPE for racking out contactors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure cabinet for unit&nbsp;4U3 capacitor/interconnect is
              selected and open.
            </li>
            <li>Ensure electrical tester is functioning properly.</li>
            <li>

          <p>
            The Board notes that the Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance
            forms are not completed in a consistent manner by Enbridge
            electricians. The form was not completed for the racking out and
            grounding of Unit&nbsp;4-U-3 on the day of the incident.
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter indicated in his statement that after a job is done
            a clearance form is to be filled out; Mr.&nbsp;Veronelly indicated
            that the electrical equipment isolation clearance form is completed
            prior to turnover to the contractor, and Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre
            was not diligent about completion of the form for previous work.
            These inconsistent practices for completion of the form are
            indicative of a lack of training and management oversight and
            control of this aspect of the electrical work being conducted for
            the pump station upgrades.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_2_4"></a>7.2.4. Safety Culture and Awareness</h4>
          <p>
            A developed safety culture should lead to effective planning,
            adherence to procedural requirements, effective communications,
            clarification of roles, and where required, completion of a safe
            work permit, hazard assessment and pre-job safety meeting. An
            effective safety culture means that all employees use their
            experience, training and communication skills to ensure that they
            and their co-workers are working safely at all times. It also means
            that employees actively identify and correct deficient procedures
            and work practices. The numerous immediate and root causes that
            preceded the incident are indicators that the safety culture at
            Enbridge Kerrobert was not adequately developed. The indicators
            include:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              Nobody told Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre to put on his PPE while in
              the 4-ESB-1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and Mr.&nbsp;Halter lacked situational
              awareness immediately prior to the incident and did not stand back
              to re-assess the job.
            </li>
            <li>Book&nbsp;2 procedures were not being followed.</li>
            <li>Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was not wearing proper PPE.</li>
            <li>
              There was poor communications between workers regarding safety,
              roles and procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because the racking and grounding out were considered routine
              tasks, there was likely some complacency about the risks
              associated with the tasks and the controls that should be in place
              to protect against the hazards.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The Board expects that Enbridge will take into consideration the
            indicators noted above and develop appropriate corrective actions to
            address the management system factors that underlie these
            indicators.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_2_5"></a>7.2.5. Training</h4>
          <p>
            The evidence shows that there has been adequate training of Enbridge
            electricians with respect to safe work procedures and proper use of
            personal protective equipment. However, there are some weaknesses in
            the training program provided to Kerrobert personnel involved in the
            incident that contributed to the incident. In order to address the
            weaknesses the Board expects that Enbridge will assess its training
            needs in the areas of:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>
              Enabling employees to better communicate with each other and with
              supervisory levels about job planning, roles and safety issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hazard assessment, determination of risk rating and completion of
              safe work permits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Completion of Electrical Equipment Isolation/Clearance forms.
            </li>
            <li>Use of safety equipment such as the voltage probe.</li>
            <li>
              Appropriate and consistent use of PPE and high voltage protective
              equipment.
            </li>
            <li>Developing a strong safety culture.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4><a id="s7_2_6"></a>7.2.6. Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
          <p>
            Enbridge demonstrated to the investigators that historically,
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre was a safe worker and was fastidious about
            wearing the required PPE. The Enbridge supervisory staff at
            Kerrobert were in disbelief that Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre would be
            working within the 4-ESB-1 building without wearing the proper PPE.
            In this regard Enbridge did not have reason to be concerned about
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre's use of PPE on the day of the incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the Board notes that there is an inconsistent approach or
            understanding among Enbridge employees at Kerrobert on PPE
            requirements. Although historically he always wore PPE,
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre did not wear the required PPE for the
            grounding task. In an interview with Mr.&nbsp;Jim&nbsp;Veronelly, he
            stated that he has done this same grounding task within 6 months
            prior to the incident and he would wear hot gloves, hot flash gear,
            glasses and coveralls. He stated that this was his standard
            procedure. Also, Mr.&nbsp;Halter indicated to investigators that the
            arc flash gear was new to the system and was not worn as much as it
            should have been. The Board notes the inconsistent approach or
            understanding on the use of PPE at Kerrobert and expects Enbridge to
            address this management system issue.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s7_3"></a>7.3. Other Contributing Factors</h3>
          <p>
            The investigation identified other factors that contributed to the
            incident however these factors are not considered to be either
            immediate errors committed by any person nor are they considered to
            be root causes or management system errors that were in place before
            the incident occurred. The Board believes these factors are relevant
            to the incident and are therefore noted in this report.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the design of the 4-ESB-1 meets the requirements of the
            <em>Canadian Electrical Code</em>, certain factors related to design
            may have contributed to the incident. There is an offset alignment
            between the row of unit motor starter contactors and the row of
            power factor capacitor cells which increases the potential for
            choosing the wrong cell door if a worker is guided by alignment. The
            unit identification labels on the unit motor starter contactors and
            the power factor capacitor cell doors are all similar in appearance
            and are not conspicuous, which may contribute to the
            mis-identification of a door. There are no interlock mechanisms
            between the unit motor starter contactors and power factor capacitor
            cells such that only the corresponding power factor capacitor cell
            can be opened when the unit motor starter contactor is racked out.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his statement, Mr.&nbsp;Halter suggested that an additional
            safety design measure would be the installation of interlocks on the
            starters and power factor capacitor cells so that once the starter
            is racked out, only the corresponding cell could be unlocked. In
            response to IR2-10b Enbridge indicated that the Kirk Key interlocks
            are included on new starters and cells associated with the Southern
            Access expansion project and that there are no current plans for
            retrofitting existing equipment with this exact system. Enbridge
            stated that it anticipates a formal recommendation from a committee
            of individuals, with experience in this area, to look further into
            this issue and make a recommendation for the entire Enbridge system.

          <h2 id="s8">8. Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Examination and analysis of the evidence related to the incident
            reveals that numerous immediate causes occurred and underlying root
            causes were in place prior to the incident. The causes relate to
            human factors and to breakdowns in the defensive layers that were
            put in place to protect the Enbridge employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of the incident, Enbridge had in place multiple
            defensive layers to ensure the protection of employees. These layers
            include a corporate wide health and safety policy, Operations and
            Maintenance manuals, safety procedures, training program, PPE
            requirements, safety equipment, monitoring, adherence to applicable
            health and safety legislation and emergency management program.
            Although there were multiple defenses in place to deal with the
            potential for an accident, there were sufficient weaknesses such
            that the layers of mitigation to protect Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre
            were not sufficient to prevent his exposure to the hazardous
            conditions. While no one weakness can be identified as a primary
            factor, the significance of each weakness cannot be underestimated,
            as a correction in any one may have been enough to prevent the
            incident. It is worth summarizing the human factors and defensive
            breakdowns of this incident in order to fully understand the
            mechanisms that lead to the incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cabinet was misidentified by Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre and
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter, so that rather than opening the de-energized
            cabinet, a live cabinet was opened. The Board recognizes that a
            human factor possibly contributed to this misidentification through
            a concept called visual cueing, where Mr.&nbsp;Halter took the
            visual queue of Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre standing in front of a
            particular cabinet. This failure did not make it inevitable that the
            incident would occur, but yet another defensive barrier failed. Had
            Mr.&nbsp;Halter been able to correctly use the voltage probe, it
            would have been discovered that the cabinet was live. The Board
            finds this to be a failure in training and in procedure; that a
            person should not use a piece of equipment that they have not been
            trained, tested and cleared to use. The next defensive barrier to
            fail was when several indicators that the work was becoming
            increasingly unsafe were not recognized, the work was not
            immediately halted and procedures re-assessed. The Board considers
            this to be a training and safety culture issue, where the
            electricians lacked the situational awareness to recognize that
            their actions could lead to an accident. Further, had
            Mr.&nbsp;St.&nbsp;Pierre donned the appropriate PPE, including arc
            flash gloves, prior to attempting to install the ground cables, he
            would have reduced the risks to which he was exposed. The Board
            notes that these causes may indicate a safety culture failure.
            Although a weak safety culture cannot be demonstrated as a system
            wide problem within Enbridge, through this incident and
            investigation the Board believes Enbridge should actively and
            aggressively look for such culture failures as part of its safety
            programs for each region.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that a responsibility of safety managers is to
            identify and apply additional defenses but with an eye to
            practicality as well as economic cost and benefit. In other words
            where a significant hazard and consequence is present, if an
            effective defensive barrier can be added for reasonable cost and
            reasonable administrative or functional burden, then it should be
            added no matter how many barriers are already in place. Where
            potential defensive mitigation is examined and found not to be
            practicable or reasonable, the decision is documented complete with
            rationale so that due diligence can be established.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, the type of grounding cables used at Kerrobert
            station at the time of the incident required that the user directly
            apply the cables to buses without the use of a hot stick and, based
            on the HRC number&nbsp;0, without the requirement for voltage rated
            gloves. If one does not use the hot stick or voltage rated gloves
            while installing the cables to energized equipment, it is likely
            that the user will be seriously injured. Using the principle of
            applying the maximum practical defensive barriers, the company would
            examine whether or not it is practical and cost effective to use
            equipment readily available on the market that isolate the user from
            the energy source, such as the use of the MT3 Safety ground kit now
            in use at Kerrobert since the incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that since the incident, Enbridge has added
            defensive layers to the racking out and grounding procedures,
            including:

            Although these added defensive layers have been applied at Kerrobert
            by Enbridge to address this specific incident, the Board believes
            Enbridge should assess the need for, and practicality of applying
            these defensive layers elsewhere on its system where the racking out
            and grounding tasks are conducted.

          <p>
            In order to address the corrective actions identified, the Board
            will require Enbridge to conduct the activities listed below.
            Enbridge shall develop a plan for completing these requirements and
            shall file with the Board within 30&nbsp;days of the release of this
            report a copy of the plan. Unless otherwise indicated in the
            requirement, the plan shall include a schedule for completion of
            each of the requirements and for reporting to the Board. The Board
            requirements are as follows:

              Re-evaluate and revise the risk rating procedures in Book&nbsp;2
              Safety in order to minimize the subjective nature of completing
              the rating procedure. The rating procedure should accurately rate
              all work that may pose a risk for workers, including those jobs
              that historically may be considered routine by some workers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify any adaptations to Book&nbsp;2 procedures that are in
              common practice in the Kerrobert area. Evaluate the adapted
              procedures with regard to maintaining or increasing the level of
              safety, practicality, cost effectiveness, compliance with
              applicable requirements and meeting corporate health and safety
              goals. Where the adapted procedures are found to be an improvement
              over existing procedures, make the appropriate revisions to
              Book&nbsp;2 procedures and provide follow-up training.
            </li>
            <li>
              Re-assess and revise existing training modules or develop new
              training modules where required for Enbridge employees engaged in
              electrical work at Kerrobert and at other Enbridge facilities, as
              necessary, in order to address the following training needs:

                  The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) is an independent agency
                  created to advance transportation safety through the
                  investigation of occurrences associated with the operation of
                  an aircraft, a ship, a pipeline or rolling stock on a railway
                  to determine cause and contributing factors. If the TSB
                  investigates an occurrence associated with the operation of a
                  pipeline, the NEB can only investigate that occurrence for
                  reasons other than determining cause and contributing factors.
                  In that instance, the NEB would co-ordinate its investigation
                  through the TSB.

<p>Dear Mr. Rae:</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Final Audit Report for Express Pipeline Ltd. (Express)</strong></p>
<p>The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) has completed its Final Audit Report of Express. The audit focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.2 <strong>Investigation and Reporting Incidents and Near Misses</strong> of the NEB Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol.</p>
<p>A Draft Audit Report documenting the Board’s evaluation of Express was provided to Express on 10&nbsp;November 2016 for review and comment. Express decided not to provide any comments on the Draft Audit Report. Since the Board had no comments to consider, no changes were made to the Draft Audit Report and its Appendices.</p>
<p>The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of whether Express was compliant with the regulatory requirements contained within:</p>
<ul>
<li>The National Energy Board Act;</li>
<li>The National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations;</li>
<li>The Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II, and the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations;</li>
</ul>
<p>Express was required to demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of the methods selected and employed within its management system and programs to meet the regulatory requirements listed above.</p>
<p>The Board has enclosed its Final Audit Report and associated Appendices with this letter. The Board will make the Final Audit Report public and it will be posted on the Board’s website.</p>
<p>Within 30&nbsp;days of the issuance of the Final Audit Report by the Board, Express is required to file a Corrective Action Plan (CAP), which describes the methods and timing for addressing the Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for approval.</p>
<p>The Board will make the CAP public and will continue to monitor and assess all of Express’ corrective actions with respect to this audit until they are fully implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of Express’ management system and programs through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its on-going regulatory mandate.</p>
<p>If you require any further information or clarification, please contact Ken&nbsp;Fortin, Lead Auditor, at 587-538-2150.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Original signed by</p>
<p>Sheri&nbsp;Young<br>
 Secretary of the Board</p>

<h3 id="smmr">Executive Summary </h3>
<p>Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s jurisdiction are required to incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management systems into their day-to-day operations.</p>
<p> This report documents the Board’s audit of Express Pipeline Ltd. (Express). The audit was focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.2 <strong>Investigation and Reporting Incidents and Near Misses</strong> of the National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol published in July 2013. The audit also evaluated some of the other management system elements which were relevant to the scope of this audit. The audit was conducted using the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR) as amended on 19&nbsp;June 2016 and the relevant sections of CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 as well as the requirements of the Canada Labour Code (CLC), Part&nbsp;II, and the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (COHSR).</p>
<p>The Board conducted the audit using the audit protocols detailed in Appendices&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II. <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> covers these five components of sub-element&nbsp;4.2: Reporting of Incidents and Near-Misses; Investigation; Developing and Implementing Corrective and Preventive Actions; Communication of Findings, Follow Up and Shared Learnings; and Analysis and Trending of Data Related to Incidents and Near-Misses. <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> covers other management system elements that were relevant to the scope of this audit. These two&nbsp;Appendices comprise the body of the audit assessment of Express.</p>
<p>The Board’s audit of Express’ regulated facilities found that Express has established processes for reporting incidents and near-misses, conducting investigations, developing corrective and preventive actions and learning from incidents. Most processes and procedures were appropriately documented, and records reviewed and interviews conducted demonstrated that they were implemented. Three findings of non-compliances related to documenting the process for taking corrective and preventive actions and for establishing and documenting the competency requirements of the investigation team members have been identified:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li><strong> Finding&nbsp;1:</strong> Express did not have an investigation procedure reflecting current investigation practices at Express. This is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3).</li>
<li> <strong>Finding&nbsp;2:</strong> Express process for taking corrective and preventive actions was not fully documented. This is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3).</li>
<li><strong> Finding&nbsp;3:</strong> Express has not established and documented the competency requirements for the investigation team members. This is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(j).</li>
</ul>
<p> Although Express has been found non-compliant in these three instances, the Board is satisfied that Express has adequate processes in place for learning from its incidents and near-misses, for identifying developing trends and for acting accordingly to prevent incidents.</p>
<p> Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued, Express must develop and submit a Corrective Action Plan for Board approval. The Corrective Action Plan must detail how Express intends to resolve the non-compliances identified by this audit. The Board will verify that the corrective actions are completed in a timely manner and applied consistently across the Express system. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of Express’ management system and programs through targeted compliance verification activities as part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.</p>

<h2 id="s1">1.0 Audit Terminology and Definitions</h2>
<p>(The Board has applied the following definitions and explanations in measuring the various requirements included in this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or guidance and practices established by the Board, where available.)</p>
<p><strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or processes comply with the scope, documentation requirements and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB&nbsp;Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated through documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to determine whether specified activities, events, conditions management systems or information about these matters conform to audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the results of the process to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Compliant:</strong> The company has demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.</p>
<p><strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has been created in the format required and meets the described regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes. Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation, quality assurance, audit and management review processes as outlined in the OPR.</p>
<p><strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has been developed in the format required. It has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how to use the process or other requirement. The company has demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented, meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews have provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially utilized).</p>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>List:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has been kept current in the format required and continues to meet regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(o). With records, the company must demonstrate that it meets the records management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5 (1)(p).</p>
<p><strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote continual improvement. The system includes the organizational structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations related to safety, security and environmental protection.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
<p>As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set out in OPR sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers more than the specific requirements of section&nbsp;6.1. It considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6.4; and considers the establishment, implementation, development and/or maintenance of the processes, inventory and list described in section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1(c) and&nbsp;(d), the company’s management system and processes must apply and be applied to the programs described in section&nbsp;55.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> The company has not demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet the legal requirements. A Corrective Action Plan must be developed and implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Practice:</strong> A repeated or customary action that is well understood by the persons authorized to carry it out.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps followed in a regular and defined order thereby allowing individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities required for completing each step.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that take place in an established order and are directed toward a specific result. A process also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A process may contain a set of procedures, if required.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management system processes applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
<p>OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) describes the Board’s required management system processes. In evaluating a company’s management system processes, the Board considers whether each process or requirement: has been established, implemented, developed or maintained as described within each section; whether the process is documented; and whether the process is designed to address the requirements of the process, for example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common 5 w’s and h approach (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR section. Processes must incorporate or contain linkage to procedures, where required to meet the process requirements.</p>
<p>
As the processes constitute part of the management system, the required processes must be developed in a manner that allows them to function as part of the system. The required management system is described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the company following its policies and goals established and required by section&nbsp;6.3.</p>
<p>
Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each process must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the programs referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which considers the specific technical requirements associated with each program and is applied to and meets the process requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that single process may not meet all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as long as they meet the process requirements (as described above) and direct the program processes to be established and implemented in a consistent manner that allows for the management system to function as described in 6.1.</p>
<p>
<strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the program is achieving the intended results.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB regulations.)</p>
<p>
The program must include details on the activities to be completed including what, by whom, when, and how. The program must also include the resources required to complete the activities.</p>

<h2 id="s3">3.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Audit Framework</h2>
<p>The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security, environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection of the environment, the Board has developed regulations requiring companies to establish and implement documented management systems applicable to specified technical management and protection programs. These management systems and programs must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the NEB Act and its associated regulations, as well as the Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II. The Board’s management system requirements are described within the OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1 through&nbsp;6.6.</p>
<p>To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits the management system and programs of regulated companies. The Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.</p>
<p>During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and samples records provided by the company in its demonstration of compliance and interviews corporate and regionally-based staff. The Board also conducts inspections of a representative sample of company facilities. This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness and implementation of the management system and programs. The Board bases the scope and location of the inspections on the needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an inspection, they are enforced as set out by the Board’s standard inspection and enforcement practices.</p>
<p>After completing its field activities, the Board develops and issues a Final Audit Report (this document). The Final Audit Report outlines the Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations of the company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports are published on the Board’s website. The audit results are integrated into the NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2 id="s4">4.0 Background</h2>
<p>The NEB expects pipeline companies to operate in a systematic, comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board expects companies to have effective, fully developed and implemented management systems and protection programs that provide for continual improvement.</p>
<p>As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and maintain effective management systems and protection programs in order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions that may adversely affect the safety and security of the company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as the protection of property and the environment.</p>
<p>This audit is focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.2 <strong>Investigation and Reporting Incidents and Near Misses</strong> of the National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol, which was published in July 2013.</p>
<p>The Board’s Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol has the following expectations for sub-element&nbsp;4.2:</p>
<div class="col-md-2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="col-md-8"><p>“The company shall have an established, implemented and effective process for reporting on hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses, and for taking corrective and preventive actions. This should include conducting investigations where required or where hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses have or could have resulted in the safety and security of the public, company employees and the pipeline, and protection of property and the environment, being significantly compromised.</p>
<p>The company shall have an established, maintained and effective data management system for monitoring and analyzing the trends in hazards, incidents and near-misses.</p>
<p>The company should integrate the results of its reporting on hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses with other data in hazard identification and analysis, risk assessments, performance measures and annual management reviews, to ensure continual improvement in meeting the company’s obligations for safety, security and protection of the environment.”</p></div>

<h2 id="s5">5.0 Audit Objectives and Scope</h2>
<p>This audit objective was to evaluate the company against the applicable requirements specifically as they relate to incident and near miss reporting and investigation, incident and near miss data analysis and integration, and taking corrective and preventive actions. The audit verified that the company has developed and implemented the systems, programs and processes to meet the applicable legal requirements in order to ensure the protection of property and the environment and the safety and security of the public and of the company’s employees.</p>
<p>The applicable regulatory requirements for this audit are contained within:</p>
<ul>
<li>the NEB Act and its associated regulations, including;</li>
<li>the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations;</li>
<li>the Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II, and the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations; and</li>
</ul>
<p>The audit scope was focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.2 of the Board’s audit protocol, and not all management system elements, per se, were in scope for a complete assessment in this audit. The following elements of the Board’s audit protocol were included in the scope but only to assess the requirements directly relevant to incident and near-miss reporting, investigation, and taking corrective and preventive actions:</p>
<ol class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2 id="s6">6.0 Audit Process, Methodology and Activities</h2>
<p>On 14&nbsp;July 2016, the Board informed Express of its intent to audit Express’ NEB regulated facilities. Board staff then submitted the audit protocols (Appendices&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II) to Express, requesting it to answer specific questions relevant to the scope of the audit and initial documentation requests. <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> is divided in five sections, with each section covering a partial component of the Board’s expectations for sub-element&nbsp;4.2. Each section lists the questions that have been asked to the company in order to demonstrate compliance. The NEB conducted its assessment based on the responses provided by the company and the evidence gathered during the audit. The same approach was used for the audit assessment summarized in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>.</p>
<p>
Board staff was in contact with Express staff on a regular basis to arrange and coordinate this audit. Express established a digital access portal for Board staff to review documentation and records.</p>
<p>On 28&nbsp;July 2016, Board staff conducted an opening meeting with representatives from Express in Calgary, Alberta to confirm the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. Subsequent to the opening meeting, interviews were held in Sherwood Park, Hardisty and at Express’s head office in Calgary between 6 and 13&nbsp;September 2016. The table below provides more details about the audit activities. Throughout the audit, Board audit staff gave Express daily summaries with action items, where required.</p>
<p>On 4&nbsp;October 2016, the Board held an audit close-out meeting with Express. At this meeting, Board staff and Express staff discussed potential deficiencies identified during the audit. Express decided not to provide any further documentation after the close-out meeting.</p>

<h2 id="s7">7.0 Audit Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>During this audit, Express was required to demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of its management system, programs and its processes as they relate to incident and near miss reporting and investigation, incident and near miss data analysis and integration, and taking corrective and preventive actions. The Board reviewed documentation and records provided by Express, conducted inspections and interviewed Express’ staff.</p>
<p>The Board’s audit of Express’ NEB-regulated facilities found that Express has established processes for reporting incidents and near-misses, conducting investigations, developing corrective and preventive actions and learning from incidents. Most processes and procedures were appropriately documented and records reviewed and interviews held demonstrated that these processes and procedures had been implemented.</p>
<p>Express was found non-compliant for not having fully documented  its process for taking corrective and preventive actions, which includes the investigation process, and for not having established and documented the competency requirements of the investigation team members.</p>
<p>The OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3) requires that companies document the processes and procedures required by the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1). The audit found that almost all of Express’ processes and procedures assessed in this audit were properly documented, except for two&nbsp;instances which are both part of the process required by the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(r).</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li><strong>Finding&nbsp;1:</strong> Express did not have an investigation procedure reflecting current investigation practices at Express.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audit verified that Express has in practice an investigation process that allows the company to investigate its incidents and near-misses, and identify the necessary corrective and preventive actions. However, the current practice is not fully reflected in a documented process, which is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3). Express had already identified this gap and has undertaken work to address this issue, as demonstrated by the new draft investigation procedure provided. The Board is satisfied with the investigation practices at Express, and this finding is a matter of properly documenting these practices.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li><strong>Finding&nbsp;2:</strong> Express process for taking corrective and preventive actions was not fully documented.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audit verified that Express has a process for developing and implementing corrective and preventive actions necessary to address the causes and contributing factors to an incident. Most of this process is properly documented; however, the part of this process where the recommended corrective and preventive actions from EHS or OIR forms are entered in the work order system is not documented. This is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3).</p>
<p>More details on the above non-compliant findings to the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3) are available in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>, sections&nbsp;2.0 and&nbsp;3.0.</p>
<p>The third finding is that Express is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(j), which requires companies to establish and implement a process for developing competency requirements.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li><strong>Finding&nbsp;3:</strong> Express has not established and documented the competency requirements for the investigation team members.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audit verified that Express has developed and implemented training programs for the company employees related to the reporting of incident and near misses, and has training requirements for staff conducting investigations and developing corrective and preventive actions. However, Express has not implemented a process for developing or documenting competency requirements for the investigation team members, which is non-compliant  with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(j).</p>
<p>Although Express has been found non-compliant in these three instances, the Board is satisfied that Express has adequate processes in place for learning from its incidents and near-misses, for identifying developing trends and for acting accordingly to prevent incidents.</p>
<p>As per the Board’s standard audit practice, Express must develop and submit a Corrective Action Plan describing its proposed methods to resolve the non-compliances identified and the timeline in which corrective actions will be completed. Express will be required to submit to the Board for approval its Corrective Action Plan within 30 days of the Final Audit Report being issued by the Board.</p>
<p>The Board will assess the implementation of all of Express’ corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of Express’ management system and programs through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.</p>
<p>The Board will make its Final Audit Report and Express’ approved Corrective Action Plan public on the Board’s website.</p>

<h3 class="well mrgn-tp-0">1.0 Reporting of Incidents and Near-Misses</h3>
<p class="mrgn-tp-lg"><strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall have an established, <strong>implemented and effective process for reporting</strong> on hazards, potential hazards, <strong>incidents and near-misses</strong>, and for taking corrective and preventive actions. This should include conducting investigations where required or where hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses have or could have resulted in the safety and security of the public, company employees and the pipeline, and protection of property and the environment, being significantly compromised.</p>
<p>The company shall have an established, maintained and effective data management system for monitoring and analyzing the trends in hazards, incidents and near-misses.</p>
<p>The company should integrate the results of its reporting on hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses with other data in hazard identification and analysis, risk assessments, performance measures and annual management reviews, to ensure continual improvement in meeting the company’s obligations for safety, security and protection of the environment.</p>

<h4 class="well mrgn-tp-0">1.1 Internal Reporting</h4>
<p><strong>Question&nbsp;1.1:</strong><br>
Describe the company’s process for internal reporting of incidents and near-misses. The response should discuss the company’s definition(s) and criteria for internally reportable incidents and near-misses.</p>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Express’ incident reporting and investigation process is part of <strong>Element&nbsp;5.0 &ndash; Monitoring of the Express-Platte Operations Management System</strong> (E-P OMS). Sub-section&nbsp;5.3, Incident Reporting and Investigation, gives an overview of the incident reporting and investigation processes used by Express.</p>
<p>Express categorizes incidents in four incident and near-miss types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)</li>
<li>Operational &ndash; abnormal pipeline operations</li>
<li>Right of way</li>
<li>Other operational &ndash; that do not involve pipeline abnormal operations</li>
</ol>
<p>Express uses the expression “Incident Without Loss” (IWOL) for “near-miss” and this report will use both terms with the same meaning intended.</p>
<ol class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><strong>1. EHS incidents / near-miss:</strong><br>
<br>Section&nbsp;308 of <strong>Express Canada Health and Safety Manual</strong> (ECHSM) contains the documented process for the internal reporting of incidents. It defines incidents as “any undesired event that results in an injury to a worker, or damage to equipment or the environment”. The process describes the initial reporting of all incidents, including serious incidents and who is responsible for doing what, from the employees to supervisors, EHS Department, Director and Manager Operations, and to the Manager of Regulatory Affairs.<br>
<br>Section&nbsp;320 of the ECHSM contains the documented process for the internal reporting of near-misses (IWOLs). Spectra defines IWOL as “any undesired event which, under slightly different circumstances could have resulted in a loss”.<br>
<br>All incidents and IWOLs are to be entered into a database named Environmental Performance and Safety Systems (EPASS) and some incidents, defined in sub-section&nbsp;308 &ndash; 1.2 of ECHSM also need to be entered in the Injury or Incident Report form.<br>
<br>Express’ definitions of EHS Incident and IWOL are broad enough to include incidents as defined in the NEB OPR and to include near-misses as intended in the NEB OPR and accident, occupational disease or other hazardous occurrence required to be reported as per COHSR&nbsp;15.3, 15.4(1) and&nbsp;15.5.<br>
<br>The company provided an example record of Injury or Incident Report for a minor equipment damage incident that occurred on 12&nbsp;July 2016.</li>
<li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><strong>2. Operational &ndash; Abnormal Operating Condition:</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Express &ndash; Platte Pipeline System Maintenance Management Procedure&nbsp;342</strong> provides “guidelines” to “Recognizing and Responding to Abnormal Operating Conditions (AOCs)” and indicates all AOCs shall be documented following EPASS, Emergency Condition Report (ECR) and Operational Incident Report (OIR) protocols as appropriate.<br>
<br>
Express has the following documented procedures for responding to AOCs and the internal reporting of AOCs:
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-bttm-md">
<li><strong>Spectra Energy Liquids &ndash; Control Centre General Procedures Manual:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong> Procedure&nbsp;3.6 Call-In Reporting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Procedure&nbsp;2.1.1.1 Emergency Conditions &ndash; General Response</strong></li>
<li><strong>Procedure&nbsp;2.1.5.1 Incoming Emergency Calls</strong></li>
<li><strong>Procedure 2.1.5.2 Emergency Condition Report (ECR)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Procedure&nbsp;2.1.5.3 Emergency Response Line (ERL) Notification System</strong></li>
<li><strong>Procedure&nbsp;2.2.8 Operational Incident Report (OIR)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Procedure&nbsp;2.2.9 Odour Complaint Notification</strong></li>
<li><strong>Procedure&nbsp;3.7 Aerial Right-of-Way Patrol Calls</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><strong>Call-In Reporting Procedure&nbsp;3.6</strong> is for non-emergency and non-odour complaint situations and these calls are documented in <strong>Call-In Reports</strong> (CIR). An example record of CIR for an aerial patrol right-of-way report on 15&nbsp;March 2015 was provided.<br>
<br>Notification and internal reporting of an emergency condition is documented in Procedure&nbsp;2.1.1.1. Example of emergency conditions covered by this procedure includes: component malfunction or personnel error that could cause a hazard to people, property or the environment, operational failure causing a hazardous condition, natural disasters affecting pipeline facilities, credible security threat and third&nbsp;party damage that could or did affect safety of pipeline operations. This procedure is for the emergency phase of the incident and points to other specific emergency response procedures for leaks, fires and activations of emergency systems. Procedure&nbsp;2.1.1.1 requires that emergency conditions be documented in ECRs and OIRs. Procedure&nbsp;2.1.5.1 provides the instructions for receiving emergency calls and points to procedures&nbsp;2.1.5.2 and&nbsp;2.2.8 for documenting the emergency conditions in ECRs and OIRs, respectively. The OIR documents the basic factual information about the pipeline system operational incidents and is not an Incident Investigation Report. Sample records of OIRs and ECRs were provided.<br>
<br>Procedure&nbsp;2.1.5.3 provides the instructions for internal notification of emergency conditions and certain non-emergency conditions. This procedure explains how to use the Emergency Response Line (ERL) notification system, which is an automated online notification tool, and the alternate notification procedure if the ERL system is not working.<br>
<br>Procedure&nbsp;2.2.9 provides the instructions for responding and documenting an odour complaint phone call. If the odour complain reveals an emergency condition, then Procedure&nbsp;2.1.1.1 is to be followed. An <strong>Odour Complaint Report</strong> (OCR) is completed for all odour complaints.</li>
<li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><strong>3. Right of Way (ROW):</strong><br>
<br>Procedure&nbsp;3.7 provides the instruction for handling and documenting the aerial patrol calls. This procedure refers to other procedures depending on the nature of the call. If this is a non-emergency and non-odour complaint, procedure&nbsp;3.6 is to be followed. If this is an emergency condition, procedure&nbsp;2.1.1.1 is then followed. For an odour complaint, procedure&nbsp;2.2.9 is to be followed.</li>
<li class="mrgn-bttm-md"><strong>4. Other operational incidents not related to pipeline abnormal operations:</strong><br>
<br>These are operations-related incidents that do not directly impact operations and are therefore not reportable to the Control Centre. This type of incident is reported according to Sections&nbsp;308 and&nbsp;320 of ECHSM.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has an established, implemented and effective process for the internal reporting of incidents and near-misses. Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance issues in relation to Question&nbsp;1.1 &ndash; Internal Reporting.</p>
<h4 class="well mrgn-tp-0">1.2 Reporting to the Board</h4>
<p><strong>Question&nbsp;1.2:</strong><br>
Describe the company’s process for the reporting of incidents to the Board. The response should discuss the company’s definition(s) and criteria for externally reportable incidents.</p>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>The company indicated in its response that the process for reporting of incidents to the Board is set out in <strong>Express Canada Emergency Response Plan</strong> (Express Canada ERP). Sections&nbsp;2.9 and&nbsp;2.8 of Express Canada’s ERP shows that the Board and other agencies are in the Express Canada’s ERP notification chart and contacts. Section&nbsp;16.2 of the Federal Reporting Requirements of Express Canada’s ERP lists the incident reporting requirements based on the NEB OPR incident definition. This section also identifies who is responsible for contacting the Board and provides some instructions on providing the preliminary and detailed incident reports.</p>
<p>The company explained that Express’ Regulatory Affairs Manager participates in Express’ Emergency Response Line (ERL) notification system and that the ERL Call Check List has a standing item for the notification of regulatory agencies. The company provided the <strong>ERL Call Check List</strong> which includes a check box for notifying regulatory agencies and requirements for notifying regulatory agencies based on the level of the emergency. Express also provided a record of an ERL call which demonstrated that notification of the Board for an incident that did not meet the NEB OPR definition for a reportable incident was effectively considered for that incident. Express decided not to report this incident to the Board since it did not have to.</p>
<p>An interview with Express’ Regulatory Affair Manager confirmed that he was aware of the reporting requirements under the NEB OPR, CLC and COHSR. From the sample of incident records reviewed during the audit, the reportable incidents, as defined in the NEB OPR and COHSR, have all been reported to the Board.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has an adequate process for the internal reporting of incidents to the Board. Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance issues in relation to Question&nbsp;1.2 &ndash; Reporting to the Board.</p>

The company explained in its response that “significant” incidents and IWOLs, as defined in Express’ <strong>Operational and EHS Significant Incident and Significant IWOL Communication Guide</strong>, are investigated using the Taproot® method.</p>
<p>For incidents or near-misses that are not formally investigated with the Taproot® method, cause and contributing factors are identified by those directly involved in the incident or near-miss and Express management or EHS staff reviewing the reported incident or near-miss.</p>
<p>During the interviews, Express staff explained that the Director of Operations has the authority to decide to conduct an investigation. A team for the investigation will normally comprise representatives from EHS, management, engineering and integrity. The lead investigator assigned to the incident will be a person with the appropriate technical background based on the nature of the incident. At least one person among the investigation team would have the Taproot® training.</p>
<p>The company provided the <strong>Express-Platte Procedure&nbsp;SMM&nbsp;159 Incident Reporting and Investigation</strong> but explained that this procedure and is not representative of todays’ practices and they are working on a new investigation procedure which is still in a draft format. The SMM&nbsp;159 procedure provided was last revised in 2012. Express provided the draft of the new investigation procedure being developed. This new procedure describes the investigation process, including the level of investigation based on the severity of the incident (minor or significant), responsibilities, deliverables and training requirements. Also provided with this procedure is an <strong>Incident Investigation Guide</strong> which provides further guidance in responsibilities, investigation activities, information gathering, interviews, chain of custody, etc. The draft investigation procedure also identifies two&nbsp;areas that need to be developed: accountabilities and competency requirements for each role on the investigation team, as well as a procedure for entering corrective actions into IVARA or EPASS. The fact that Express does not have a documented investigation process that reflects current practices, and that the investigation process is a necessary component of a process for taking corrective and preventive actions, is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3), which requires the process required by OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(r) to be documented.</p>
<p>An internal investigation report was provided for an incident that was also reported to the Board (Incident&nbsp;2015-073). The information that was reported to the Board was consistent with the information contained in Express’ internal investigation. The investigation report identified cause and contributing factors to the incident and the necessary corrective and preventive actions. An inspection conducted at the site of the incident confirmed that the corrective and preventive action directly related to the piping and its supports have been implemented.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has in practice an investigation process that allows the company to investigate its incidents and near-misses, and identify the necessary corrective and preventive actions. However, the current practice is not fully reflected in a documented process, which is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3). Express has already identified this gap and has undertaken work to address it, as demonstrated by the new draft investigation procedure provided.</p>

<p><strong>Question&nbsp;3.0:</strong><br>
Describe the company’s processes and procedures for developing and implementing all necessary corrective and preventive actions to address all of the incident causes and contributing factors.</p>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Express explained in its response that all incidents are analyzed to identify the conditions that caused the incident / IWOL that can be eliminated or mitigated to avoid the repeat of the occurrence, to identify new hazards that needs to be communicated and to identify whether a control centre operator error might have been a contributing factor. The result of that analysis constitutes the basis for identifying the corrective and preventive actions to address the cause and contributing factors. Express also explained that when Taproot® is used to investigate an incident or IWOL, the Taproot® methodology provides the structure to identify causes and guide the development of corrective and preventive actions.</p>
<p>Corrective and preventive actions are initially recorded as “recommendations” in the OIR for operational incident and in the Injury and Incident Report form for EHS incidents. Staff interviewed explained that recommendations for corrective and preventive actions are then entered into Express’ maintenance management program named IVARA-Bentley for ensuring their implementation. For OIR recommendations, the Director of Operations is the last person to review and sign-off on the OIR and he also has the responsibility of contacting the Operations Maintenance Manager who will get the recommendations entered in the work order system (IVARA-Bentley). The interviewed personnel also explained that the Control Centre Administrator is ensuring that all OIR recommendations have been assigned a work order prior to closing the OIR. For EHS recommendations for corrective actions, the EHS staff or manager reviewing and signing off on the Injury or Incident Report form has the responsibility of contacting the Operations Maintenance Manager who will get the recommendations entered in the work order system. NEB auditors were able to verify that this part of the process for ensuring that corrective actions are being entered in the work order system is being completed, as evidenced by the sample of records reviewed and by the responses provided during the interviews. However this part of the process is not being documented, which is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3), which requires the process required by OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(r) to be documented.</p>
<p>Work orders generated are assigned to individuals with specific actions to accomplish and due dates. Work orders are tracked to closure and management must sign-off on completed work orders. <strong>Procedure &ndash; 116 of E-P Maintenance Management Procedures</strong> was provided. This procedure provides instruction for initiating, completing and disposing of work orders. Some corrective actions may also trigger Express’ Management of Change (MOC) process.</p>
<p>Express provided a sample of work order records demonstrating that corrective and preventive actions identified following incidents had been tracked and implemented.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has a process for developing and implementing corrective and preventive actions necessary to address the causes and contributing factors to an incident. However, the part of this process where the recommended corrective and preventive actions from EHS or OIR forms are entered in the work order system is not documented. This is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(3).</p>

<p><strong>Question&nbsp;4.0:</strong><br>
Describe the company’s processes and procedures to communicate the findings (cause and contributing factors) and corrective and preventive actions related to incidents and near-misses throughout the organization to ensure the company can prevent the occurrence of incidents due to similar causes. Also, describe the company’s process for learning from such events.</p>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Incidents and IWOLs entered in EPASS are reviewed on a monthly basis with Express field employees at the safety meetings to share learnings with employees. This is documented in <strong>Express Canada Health and Safety Standards Manual</strong>, Section&nbsp;312. The company also explained in its response that selected OIRs and new hazards are also reviewed at these meetings. The company provided an example record of monthly safety meeting minutes (<strong>Crew Safety Meeting Minutes</strong>), which indicated review of incidents and near-misses were conducted.</p>
<p>OIRs are distributed to control centre operators and to management as identified in Procedure&nbsp;2.2.8 and the OIR report template. The company also explained that selected OIRs are reviewed as part of control centre operator team meetings.</p>
<p>Express explained that they have quarterly governance meetings with a standing agenda item on incidents and IWOLs, where each program lead presents a status report which includes a section on incidents and IWOLs. Records of <strong>Quarterly Program Status Reports</strong> were provided for the first two&nbsp;quarters of 2016, which demonstrated that incidents and IWOLs were discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>Express also uses safety bulletins to communicate corporate-wide on incident and IWOL causes and key learnings. An example record of a safety bulletin was provided.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has processes for and is communicating the findings, corrective and preventive actions, and the learnings from its incidents and near-misses. Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance issues in relation to Question&nbsp;4.0 &ndash; Communication of Findings, Follow Up &amp; Shared Learnings.</p>

<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Express submitted documents and records to demonstrate its processes and procedures for the collection, monitoring and analysis of trends for incidents and near-misses.</p>
<p>Express’ Incident Review Team (IRT) evaluates and trends incidents and near-misses as outlined in the <strong>Express OMS Procedure &ndash; Incident Review Team</strong>. This team is composed of representatives from operations, the control centre, technical services and engineering. The IRT reports to the OMS Governance Team on a quarterly basis and any significant issues are reported in a meeting summary to the Accountable Officer. The reports are also reviewed at Express Safety Meetings and at Control Centre Meetings to communicate the incident results to Express employees.</p>
<p>The <strong>Express OMS Procedure &ndash; Incident Review Team</strong> refers to incident databases (EPASS and OIR) that are used to identify recurring incidents and/or recurring incident causes to develop recommendations for corrective actions to address negative trends. This procedure outlines the roles and responsibilities as well as the processes and activities required to fulfil the incident review procedure.</p>
<p>Express submitted its <strong>SEL OMS &ndash; Management Summary &ndash; Quarterly Program Status Reports (2Q2015)</strong> as records demonstrating the collection, monitoring and analysis of trends in incidents and near-misses. Section&nbsp;II of this report detailed the objectives and performance measures results. At a high level, the performance measures for 2015 to date were summarized. Section&nbsp;III Incidents contained a summary of the Incident Review Team’s quarterly update with comments on incident data within EPASS, IWOLs and the OIRs as well as comments on the incident trends and recommendations for corrective actions.</p>
<p>Express submitted its<strong> Incident Review Team Q4&nbsp;Update</strong> to the OMS Team (28&nbsp;April 2016) that contained a review of the EPASS events and OIRs. This OMS update contained comments on common contributing factors in the OIRs for 2016 to date and comments on the trends noted in the OIRs.

Describe the policies that the company has to address the above expectations as they relate to incident prevention, reporting and investigation.</p>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>The Spectra Energy Liquids (SEL) document, <strong>E-P OMS Operations Management System Policy</strong>, under the Performance Principles, states that “Incidents and performance trends will be reviewed to identify opportunities for improvement in our processes and to enhance our ability to anticipate problems.” The document was signed by the President, Spectra Energy Liquids and dated 24&nbsp;November 2015.</p>
<p>Express’ document: <strong>Environmental, Health &amp; Safety Policy</strong>, under the Stewardship Principles, states “[w]e will strive to improve operations with a focus on preventing environmental and safety incidents and preserving public safety”. The document states that “[t]his policy and these principles form the foundation of Spectra Energy’s EHS Management System and are fundamental to the Corporation’s long-term success.” The EH&amp;S document is signed by the President and Chief Executive Officer for Spectra Energy and is dated 21&nbsp;April 2014.</p>
<p>Express’ document, <strong>Hazard and Incident Reporting: Non-Retaliation and Non-Retribution Policy</strong> dated 1&nbsp;August 2014, includes in its Statement of Purpose and Philosophy, that it “expects its employees, contractors, suppliers and others to promptly report hazards, potential hazards, and incidents with or without loss”. The policy’s aim is “to promote the reporting of such information, free from fear of indiscriminate adverse actions, retaliation or retribution solely because of such reporting.”  The Policy includes the conditions under which a person who makes a report will be granted immunity from disciplinary action. Finally, the document includes a phone number and online link to the Spectra Energy Ethics Line for the situations where an employee could feel uncomfortable reporting a Safety Concern through any of Express’ other methods.</p>
<p>The expectation for adherence to the policy for non-retaliation and non-retribution was communicated to Spectra Energy Liquids employees via email from the President, Spectra Energy Liquids dated 15&nbsp;December 2014. The email also stated the expectations for Express employees to include training on the policy as part of the Annual Compliance Training. Compliance training is conducted through Express’ iComply System and employees are required to take annual refresher training and certification. One module of iComply focuses on the <strong>Hazard and Incident Reporting: Non-Retaliation and Non-Retribution Policy</strong> for employees.</p>

<p><strong>Question&nbsp;2.1:</strong><br>
Explain how hazards identified through incident and near miss reporting are used to input the hazard identification process and the hazard inventory.</p><h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Hazards that are identified through <strong>Operational Incident Reports</strong> (OIRs) or EPASS incident reports can be recommended for addition to the hazard and risk register as outlined in the E-P OMS Manual. The OIR contains 14&nbsp;probable contributing causes along with details if required. </p>
<p>The OIR contains sections for Recommendations from the Originator, Team Lead, Field Supervisor, Manager Operations, Manager Engineering, Director Customer Operations, Director Technical Services and Director Operations to ratify the report as it stands, to evaluate whether the Control Centre Operator (CCO) and OP/Tech actions were adequate (if applicable) and whether the procedures were effective. In the OIR, the Operational Incident Flow Chart includes a step for the Control Centre Administrator to ensure that the OIR is complete in the OIR database and sends all CCO’s the information for the purpose of promoting shared learnings.</p>
<p>The Express E-P OMS Procedure, <strong>Hazard and Risk Register Monitoring and Management Reporting</strong> (1&nbsp;July 2015), specifies the six step work flow requirements for identifying and documenting hazards, updating the hazard and risk register whenever significant new hazards are identified and reviewing the hazard and risk register with appropriate levels of management. Following a SCADA communication outage incident at a pump station on 19&nbsp;October 2015, a new hazard was identified: loss of control centre communication with remote facilities. Express provided minutes of the <strong>3Q&nbsp;2015 Quarterly Programs Summary Report</strong>, dated 26-27&nbsp;October 2015, indicating that the new hazard was to be added to the hazard and risk register. Express also submitted evidence that the new hazard had been included in the <strong>Express-Platte OMS Hazard and Risk Register</strong> in 2Q&nbsp;2016.</p>
<p>In terms of EH&amp;S hazards, Section&nbsp;320 of the <strong>Express Canada Health &amp; Safety Standards Manual</strong> refers to Workplace Hazard / IWOL Reporting. Express provided the E-P OMS Procedure, <strong>Hazard Identification and Reporting</strong> (1&nbsp;October 2014) for identifying new hazards and adding the newly identified hazards to the risk register. A flowchart is included with the process, activity and responsibility as well as a template for hazard identification and reporting with instructions for completion. Express employees receive training on the process through KEEP, which is assessed under Question&nbsp;3.4 for Training and Competency.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has adequate processes and procedures to identify hazards through incident and near-miss reporting and that newly identified hazards are incorporated into its hazard and risk registry. Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance issues in relation to Question&nbsp;2.1 &ndash; Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control.</p>

<ul>
<li>Has your company identified and staffed the positions necessary for meeting the requirements of sub-element&nbsp;4.2 (i.e. incident reporting, investigation, implementing corrective actions, communication and learning)? If so, explain those positions and their roles and provide the names and titles of staff in these positions.</li>
<li>How has the company communicated and documented its roles, responsibilities and authority for the above positions?</li>
</ul>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Express provided the organization charts for Spectra Energy Liquids (SEL), Alberta Operations and identified key personnel for the Management System. Express stated that the company has identified and staffed the positions necessary for meeting the requirements of Element&nbsp;4.2.</p>
<p>Express referenced the <strong>Express Canada Health &amp; Safety Standards Manual</strong>. Section&nbsp;5.3, Incident Reporting and Investigation, which states that the Safety Program manages incident reporting and investigation. There are also references within this manual for Section&nbsp;304 First Aid Reporting, Section&nbsp;308 Incident Reporting, Section&nbsp;310 Inspections/Investigations, Section&nbsp;311 Medical Aid Reporting, Section&nbsp;320 Workplace Hazard/Near Miss Reporting and Procedure&nbsp;159 Incident Reporting and Investigation.</p>
<p>Express referred to its <strong>OMS Handbook, Maintenance Manual Procedure&nbsp;342</strong>, and provided its Express-Platte Pipeline Operations Managements System (OMS) manual, Overview of the OMS Elements. Element&nbsp;5, Monitoring, which in the description of Incident Reporting and Investigation, states that “[i]ncident reporting and investigation supports continual improvement. Investigating incidents to identify causes provides the data necessary to enhance controls. Sharing lessons learned from incident investigations and reviews reduces repeat occurrences.”</p>
<p>Express referred to the <strong>Control Room Management Plan</strong>, Section&nbsp;2.1 “Roles and Responsibilities of Control Center Operators.” While Section&nbsp;2.1 does not explicitly refer to incident management roles or responsibilities, it states that “in addition to the defined roles and responsibilities, general knowledge and understanding of SEL operations procedures is required with emphasis on Normal, Abnormal and Emergency operating conditions” which would include incidents and near-misses.</p>
<p>Express provided the <strong>Control Center General Procedures Manual</strong>, Section&nbsp;2.2 Abnormal Operating Conditions. This document refers to the procedures to be followed to complete an <strong>Operational Incident Report</strong> (OIR) and also includes recommendations for corrective actions and follows up. This document appears to be adequate in detailing the Control Centre Operator’s roles and responsibilities for incident reporting.</p>
<p>Express also provided the <strong>Field OMS Refresher Training</strong> (March 2016), which is a high level presentation on the OMS to Operations. The presentation incudes a statement that Operations has key responsibilities in supporting OMS by identifying and reporting hazards and reporting incidents and IWOL’s.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has identified and staffed the positions necessary for meeting the requirements of incident reporting, investigation, implementing corrective actions, and communication and shared learning. Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance issues in relation to Question&nbsp;2.4 &ndash; Organizational Structure, Roles and Responsibilities.</p>

<li>Describe how the company applies its MOC process to corrective and preventive actions in relation to sub-element&nbsp;4.2 (as applicable)?</li>
</ul>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Express has demonstrated that its Management of Change (MOC) processes and procedures apply to all OMS programs and is applicable to all changes that fall within the scope of the procedure. Any action and/or change that is developed as part of an incident investigation would typically be in the scope of the MOC process.</p>
<p>Express provided documentation on its MOC process. The <strong>Spectra Energy E-P OMS Procedure Management of Change</strong> dated 4&nbsp;May 2016 is a high level overview of the MOC. The Purpose, Scope and Roles and Responsibility are stated in this document. Appendix&nbsp;4.3 Definitions of Change Categories covers Physical Changes, Operational Changes, Procedural Changes, Organizational Changes and Other Covered Changes that could be interpreted to cover changes that might result from an incident investigation and determination of root and/or contributing causes and the resulting corrective and preventive actions.</p>
<p>Section&nbsp;2.0 of the MOC document contains a flowchart to determine if a “Change” is covered by the MOC procedure and Table 1 contains a Screening Checklist to identify the nature / scope of the change. Appendix&nbsp;4.1 is an example of an MOC form and instructions that includes the change description, justification, cost/materials, risk assessment and reviewers / approvers required to complete the MOC. Appendix&nbsp;4.2 details the Roles and Responsibilities for the MOC.</p>
<p>Express provided an example record of a completed MOC form, dated 25&nbsp;January 2016, for a change to the Pipeline Logic Control (PLC) in the event of a SCADA loss of communication at a pump station. Express provided an MOC Status Report that tracks MOC’s and relates the MOC’s to OIR’s where applicable and to the Work Orders where applicable.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has a Management of Change (MOC) process that is applicable to changes that could result from incidents or near misses. Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance issues in relation to Question&nbsp;3.3 &ndash; Management of Change.</p>

<p><strong>Question&nbsp;3.4:</strong><br>
Describe the training for the company employees related to the reporting of incident and near misses, and the training for staff conducting investigations and developing corrective and preventive actions.</p>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>For Control Centre Operators (CCO), Express provided relevant sections from its <strong>Control Room Management Plan</strong> document (CRMP) that stated that as part of its onboarding and periodic requalification, CCO’s are required to learn the specific procedures related to incident reporting, including when and how to report (OIR’s). Section&nbsp;2.6.2 of the CRMP speaks to operational incidents and the OIR’s and the Emergency Condition Report (ECR). Section&nbsp;2.7 of the CRMP deals with Training, and references the requirements of the United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)&nbsp;49 Part&nbsp;195.446(h) that covers training for Control Room Management.</p>
<p>Section&nbsp;2.7 of the CRMP also refers to the CCO Training Program modules: Orientation Module; Core Module; General Procedures for Operations and Emergencies; Desk Specific Operations Procedures; Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems and Computational Pipeline Monitoring (CPM) Systems. To further explain the CCO Training Modules, Express provided a document detailing these areas of training and respective evaluation methods used. This document contains information on the modules: Orientation, Core, General Procedures for Operations and Emergency Conditions, Desk-Specific Operations Procedures, SCADA Systems, CPM (Leak Detection) Systems, Control Room Management Plan (CRM), Fatigue Risk Management (FRM), Tabletop Training, Operational Incident Report (OIR) Reviews, Recognizing and Responding to Abnormal Operating Conditions (AOC’s), Operating Setups, Operator Qualification (OQ) Program and Requirements for a CCO to be “SEL Qualified” to operate independently at a Pipeline Desk. This document appears to be targeted to the US requirements (49&nbsp;CFR Part&nbsp;195 for Hazardous Liquids) and the Pipeline Safety Operator Qualification (OQ) Program requirements. The modules of the CCO training program cover the necessary procedures for the scope of this audit as applicable to the role of the CCO.</p>
<p>Express provided its <strong>Incident, Workplace Hazards, and IWOL Reporting Learning Packet</strong> (July 2015) for Lesson&nbsp;1, Incident Reporting. This learning packet contains questions requiring written answers. The questions are detailed and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Express provided its <strong>Incident, Workplace Hazards, and IWOL Reporting Knowledge Evaluation</strong> document (July 2015) intended as training for field operations personnel. This document is generally referred to as KEEP. The training module is a 15&nbsp;multiple choice type of knowledge evaluations that is specific to incident reporting. Express also provided its IComply System screenshots as evidence of certification of employees for the Code of Business Ethics &ndash; employee training and awareness.</p>
<p>Express provided a training record for 10&nbsp;employees for TapRoot® Root Cause Analysis. Training date was 21&nbsp;July 2015. Express stated that its employees that could be part of incident investigation teams receive the TapRoot® training. TapRoot® is used to determine root causes, contributing factors and to provide guidance for the development of corrective and preventive actions. Documentation submitted for the two&nbsp;day TapRoot® training program covers various types of training for root cause failure analysis, trending techniques and developing corrective actions.</p>
<p>Interviews conducted with Express staff and the review of <strong>Procedure SSM&nbsp;159</strong> and of the draft procedure for Incident Investigation indicated that Express has not established and documented the competency requirements for the investigation team members. The OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(j) requires, among other things, that companies establish and implement a process for developing competency requirements. Express has not implemented this process for the competency requirements of the investigation team; therefore, this is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(j). Express has already identified this gap and is working on addressing it, as demonstrated in the draft E-P OMS Procedure, Incident Investigation (5.3.100) it provided.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has developed and implemented training programs for the company employees related to the reporting of incident and near misses, and has training requirements for staff conducting investigations and developing corrective and preventive actions. However, Express has not implemented a process for developing or documenting competency requirements for the investigation team members, which is non-compliant with the OPR s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(j).</p>

Describe the company process for conducting management reviews as it relates to sub-element&nbsp;4.2.</p>
<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>Express conducts management reviews in accordance with its OMS Procedure, <strong>Governance and the OMS Manual</strong>. The OMS governance team is responsible for preparation and delivery of the annual management review typically scheduled at the end of Q1 on an annual basis. The annual review process is supported by quarterly OMS governance meetings where OMS program information is captured and summarized. Express submitted Management Review presentations for 8&nbsp;April 2015, and relevant excerpts from the 4Q2014, 2Q2015, 3Q2015, 4Q2105, 1Q2016, and 2Q2016 SEL OMS &ndash; Management Summary &ndash; Quarterly Program Status Reports.</p>
<p>The <strong>Express OMS Management Summary</strong> follows a standard template for detailing the past incidents and reviewing objectives and performance measures.

<p>Express provided the <strong>2Q16 Quarterly Status Reports</strong> for the OMS programs of Asset Integrity, Design and Construction, Emergency Management, Environmental Management, Safety and Security. These reports summarized the OMS program status on goals, objectives, targets, performance measures, results year to date and trends of the performance measures. The reports also detailed each program’s results for control metrics, targets, results year to date and trends in the control metrics.</p>
<p>Express also submitted its <strong>2015 NEB Annual Report for the Express Canada Pipeline System</strong> (28&nbsp;April 2016) signed by the Accountable Officer. This report detailed the company’s OMS program level accomplishments for Safety, Asset Integrity, Environment, Security and Emergency Management as well as the company’s efforts with respect to continuous improvement.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>The audit verified that Express has a process for conducting management reviews as it relates to sub-element&nbsp;4.2 and has provided documentation of management reviews for all OMS programs. Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance issues in relation to Question&nbsp;5.0 &ndash; Management Review.</p>

<p>Express operates an oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta to the Canada / US border as shown on Figure&nbsp;1. The pipeline is of 24&nbsp;inch diameter with a nominal capacity of 280&nbsp;000&nbsp;barrels per day. The pipeline starts at Express’ Hardisty terminal which has seven storage tanks, each having a storage capacity of 150&nbsp;000&nbsp;barrels. Express also has six lateral pipelines connecting its terminal with the other operators in the Hardisty area (see Figure&nbsp;2).

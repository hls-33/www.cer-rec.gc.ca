          <p>
            On 22&nbsp;December 2017, the National Energy Board (NEB or Board)
            released its Final Audit Report detailing the audit of TMPU&rsquo;s
            Management System and Emergency Management Program. In that report,
            the Board indicated that its original audit plan had included
            specific activities to assess TMPU&rsquo;s response preparation for
            fires at its Westridge, Burnaby and Edmonton Terminals; however, at
            the time of the report&rsquo;s release this assessment was not
            complete. The Board released its Final Audit Report without the fire
            preparedness activities assessment in order to allow TMPU to develop
            and implement any required corrective and preventive actions for the
            protection of people and the environment in a timely manner. The
            Board indicated that it would issue a subsequent report relative to
            the fire protection at the terminals, once it had completed that
            assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has now completed the required review of the fire response
            assessment and is issuing this letter-report as an addendum to its
            original Final Audit Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this audit report addendum, as in the Final Audit Report, the
            Board made findings in relation to TMPU&rsquo;s Management System
            and Emergency Management program. The findings of the audit are
            based upon an assessment of whether TMPU demonstrated compliance
            with the regulatory requirements contained within:

            As noted, this letter is intended to be an addendum to the
            Board&rsquo;s 15&nbsp;January 2018 Final Audit Report. That report
            documents the Board&rsquo;s audit and assessment of TMPU&rsquo;s
            Management System and its Emergency Management Program against the
            requirements of the NEB Act and OPR. However, at the time of the
            release of its report, the Board had not finished its audit of
            TMPU&rsquo;s response preparation for fires at its Westridge,
            Burnaby and Edmonton Terminals. It further indicated that &ldquo;a
            subsequent report will be issued relative to the fire protection at
            terminals, once the Board has completed [that] work.&rdquo; This
            letter is intended to fulfil this commitment. The Board assessed
            TMPU&rsquo;s fire preparedness activities at the noted terminal
            facilities during the period from January 2016 to March 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            The previously released Final Audit Report included a full
            assessment of TMPU&rsquo;s Management System and Emergency
            Management Program which are applicable to the terminal fire
            preparedness activities as a specific set of hazards to be managed
            as per the OPR. The findings made in that report therefore are
            expected to apply to the management of TMPU&rsquo;s fire
            preparedness and response activities as appropriate and relevant as
            well as any issues identified in this addendum. In this part of its
            audit, the Board assessed TMPU&rsquo;s EM Program plans, practices,
            facilities, human resource allocations and activities (including
            equipment and maintenance thereof) to determine whether the
            identified fire related hazards and risks had been managed as
            required. The Board audited TMPU&rsquo;s fire preparedness
            management activities within the context of the requirements of the
            OPR focussing on the applicable management system requirements
            identified in section&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;6.1 through&nbsp;6.6 and the
            EM program requirements identified in section&nbsp;32 through 35.
            This assessment was done through document and record reviews,
            interviews with TMPU staff and contractors, information requests and
            site visits.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the Board contracted PLC Fire Safety Solutions, (PLC)
            to assist with the technical review of fire suppression systems and
            related infrastructure at the terminals. PLC was contracted to
            provide independent advice to Board staff specifically regarding the
            fire suppression and response plans and equipment. PLC&rsquo;s
            review involved documentation review and in-field activities
            starting in January 2016. The Board received PLC&rsquo;s final
            report in December 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            As per the Board&rsquo;s standard audit practice, TMPU was provided
            an opportunity to review PLC&rsquo;s initial findings and its
            report. TMPU provided comments in a letter dated 31&nbsp;January
            2017. In its response, TMPU asserted that the Board should disregard
            PLC&rsquo;s report in its entirety for reasons that included:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>
              PLC&rsquo;s incorrect application and interpretation of standards
              and regulations in its assessment of TMPU&rsquo;s facilities and
              activities; and
            </li>
            <li>
              PLC, as agent of the Board, failing to adhere to the principles of
              procedural fairness to which TMPU is entitled.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Board reviewed PLC&rsquo;s report in conjunction with
            TMPU&rsquo;s response and internal NEB operational and legal
            analysis. Following the consideration of the various inputs, the
            Board has confirmed that several of PLC&rsquo;s findings were based
            on the incorrect application and interpretation of the OPR and other
            regulatory requirements. As a result, the Board has determined that,
            in accordance with its mandate to promote the consistent application
            of its regulations, it would not adopt the PLC report in its
            entirety.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has considered the TMPU concerns about procedural fairness
            and is of the view that procedural fairness was not breached. While
            there was an initial lack of clarity about whether TMPU was being
            audited to legal requirements, that issue has been resolved. TMPU
            had opportunities to meet with PLC auditors and Board auditors on a
            number of occasions. TMPU also had an opportunity to provide
            detailed comments on the PLC report which the Board considered and
            in some instances accepted. TMPU also had an opportunity to respond
            to the Board&rsquo;s information requests issued after the PLC
            report.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the PLC report has not been fully adopted by the Board, the
            PLC report did contain certain information that could be used to
            inform other audit activities. The report identified a number of
            potential deficiencies that could be considered to relate to hazards
            and associated risk that TMPU would need to provide additional
            information in order for the Board to assess the suitability of the
            company&rsquo;s Emergency Management Program as it relates to fire
            response. The Board followed up on these potential deficiencies to
            assess the company&rsquo;s terminal fire preparedness activities.
            Throughout the period covered in this audit and the additional fire
            preparedness review, TMPU provided access to all available requested
            information. It also continued to make improvements to its EM
            program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the information provided by TMPU, with the exception of the
            two areas noted below, the Board did not identify any new areas of
            Non-Compliance that were not already included in the Board&rsquo;s
            previously released Final Audit Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the audit, the Board identified issues associated with
            TMPU&rsquo;s established response time goals for assembling staff
            and contractors to initiate the extinguishment of tank fires.
            Specifically, the Board noted that TMPU has established a goal of
            6&nbsp;hours to assemble its staff and contractors in the event of a
            tank fire. However, during the audit TMPU provided information
            indicating that, in certain conditions, a tank boil-over event could
            potentially occur before the 6&nbsp;hour response goal. For example,
            for one of the scenarios provided, a tank with a low level of
            product could escalate from a full surface fire to a boil-over event
            in 5.1&nbsp;hours. The Board is therefore requiring TMPU to
            incorporate a four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;hour fire response goal within its
            EM program to address this inconsistency. The Board is of the view
            that this represents a goal that reflects response requirements and
            a contingency buffer.
          </p>
          <p>
            A gap was also identified within TMPU&rsquo;s EM exercise program.
            In particular, the Board noted that TMPU did not conduct unannounced
            exercises to test its response capability in line with its EM plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the audit, TMPU indicated that its EM exercise design
            practice does not include undertaking unannounced exercises. TMPU
            indicated that they use the exercises as training opportunities;
            therefore, communicating or announcing exercises prior to
            undertaking them allows for better involvement rates for staff and
            contractors and better learning outcomes. The Board does not dispute
            these facts and notes that TMPU undertakes a significant number of
            exercises each year. However, the Board notes that TMPU&rsquo;s EM
            program, as it relates to terminal fires, involves the use of staff
            and third party contractors that are required to assemble from
            off-site prior to initiating a response. Given all of the variables
            to be tested, the resources required and the potential consequences
            of an event, the Board is of the view that TMPU&rsquo;s strict
            reliance on planned exercises does not allow for the identification
            of previously unanticipated complications that could interfere with
            an effective response at its terminals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is therefore directing TMPU to incorporate regular
            unannounced exercises into its EM exercise program as a required
            practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board&rsquo;s review of TMPU&rsquo;s fire preparedness focussed
            on the company&rsquo;s Burnaby, Westridge and Edmonton facilities.
            While the Board has made specific directions related to the Edmonton
            and Burnaby Terminals (Items&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 in its attachment to
            this letter), it expects, as with all of its audit findings, that
            TMPU will take a systematic approach when implementing its
            corrective and preventive actions. It is expected that, TMPU will
            develop and implement preventive actions to establish fire response
            goals and have unannounced exercises at each of its facilities based
            on the analysis of their individual fire hazards in a manner
            consistent with the above direction and the consequences identified
            during its analyses of its hazards. The Board will include the
            review of TMPU&rsquo;s activities related to this item at its other
            facilities in the Board&rsquo;s on-going compliance verification
            program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, as the Board considers an unannounced demonstration of an
            ability to implement a response to tank fires to be of importance.
            Therefore, within 12&nbsp;months of the establishment and
            integration of the four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;hour response targets, as
            described in 1a) of Attachment&nbsp;1 to this letter, the Board will
            direct TMPU to undertake a full deployment exercise at one of its
            Edmonton or Burnaby Terminals. The exercise will be unannounced and
            will be initiated at the time and location of the Board&rsquo;s
            choosing. Board staff will be on site to announce the exercise and
            observe and evaluate TMPU&rsquo;s response. This exercise may be
            considered towards TMPUs compliance with Board Direction 2c) of
            Attachment 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Board has provided specific direction for TMPU, no additional
            Corrective and Preventive Action Plan is required to be filed with
            the Board for approval. The Board will monitor and assess
            TMPU&rsquo;s response to these directions as part of its on-going
            compliance verification activities associated with the rest of this
            audit until they are fully implemented to assure the safety of
            people and the environment. The Board will also continue to monitor
            the implementation and effectiveness of TMPU&rsquo;s EM program and
            management system through targeted compliance verification
            activities as a part of its on-going regulatory mandate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board&rsquo;s priority is to protect Canadians and the
            environment. Accordingly, the Board requires all companies to
            regularly evaluate and continually improve the effectiveness of
            their management systems and to build and maintain a strong safety
            culture.

          <h2>
            Fire Preparedness and Response Assessment Details and Specific
            Direction
          </h2>
          <h3>1 Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            In accordance with section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy Board
            Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the Board)
            conducted a compliance audit of Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC&rsquo;s
            (TMPU) Management System and Emergency Management (EM) program. On
            15&nbsp;January 2018, the National Energy Board released its Final
            Audit Report detailing the audit of TMPU&rsquo;s Management System
            and Emergency Management Program. In that report, the Board
            indicated that its original audit plan included specific activities
            to assess TMPU&rsquo;s response preparation for fires at its
            Westridge, Burnaby and Edmonton Terminals; however, at the time of
            the report&rsquo;s release that assessment was not complete. In
            order to ensure the timely resolution of issues noted in the audit,
            the Board released its Final Audit Report without the fire
            preparedness assessment. The Board indicated that it would issue a
            subsequent report relative to the fire protection at the terminals,
            once the Board had completed that assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has now completed the required review of the fire response
            and is hereby issuing this letter-report as an addendum to its
            original 2018 Final Audit Report.
          </p>
          <h4>1.1.1 Audit Objective</h4>
          <p>
            The objective of this audit was to verify that TMPU is complying
            with the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR).
            Specifically, the Board audited TMPU&rsquo;s fire preparedness and
            response activities as they relate to its Edmonton, Burnaby and
            Westridge Terminals.
          </p>
          <h4>1.2.1 Audit Scope</h4>
          <p>
            The final regulatory scope of the audit included relevant sections
            of:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>The NEB Act; and</li>
            <li>The OPR.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Board&rsquo;s audit plan contained specific activities to assess
            TMPU&rsquo;s response preparation for fires at its Westridge,
            Burnaby and Edmonton Terminals.
          </p>
          <h4>1.3.1 TMPU Overview</h4>
          <p>
            TMPU operates the Trans Mountain Pipeline that is approximately
            1150&nbsp;kilometers long from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British
            Columbia. There are twenty-three active pump stations located along
            the pipeline route. The line capacity is approximately
            300,000&nbsp;barrel per day (bpd) and the line flow is
            eight&nbsp;kilometers per&nbsp;hour. In addition to the pump
            stations, four terminals in Edmonton, Kamloops, Abbotsford and
            Burnaby house storage tanks for incoming feeder pipelines and tanker
            loading facilities. Presently, the terminals have the following
            number of storage tanks &ndash; Edmonton Terminal&nbsp;35,
            Kamloops&nbsp;2, Sumas (Abbotsford) 6 and Burnaby&nbsp;13.
            Additionally, the Board regulates TMPU&rsquo;s Westridge Marine
            Terminal near Burnaby, British Columbia.
          </p>
          <h3>2 Assessment of Compliance</h3>
          <h4>2.1.1 General</h4>
          <p>
            To determine compliance, the Board evaluated TMPU&rsquo;s documents
            and records and conducted interviews with company personnel and
            contractors on issues relevant to the audit scope and criteria. The
            Board applied the working definitions listed in Appendix&ndash;III
            &ndash; Terminology and Definitions, included in its 15&nbsp;January
            2018 Final Audit Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two possible audit findings assigned to any item by the
            Board in this audit:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-spcd">
            <li>Compliant (see attached list of definitions); and</li>
            <li>Non-Compliant (see attached list of definitions).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            2.2.1 Assessment &ndash; TMPU Terminal Fire Preparedness and
            Response
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Board assessed TMPU&rsquo;s activities related to its EM Program
            plans, practices, facilities, human resource allocations and
            activities (including equipment and maintenance thereof) to
            determine whether the identified fire related hazards and risks had
            been managed as required. The Board audited TMPU&rsquo;s fire
            preparedness management activities within the context of the
            requirements of the OPR focusing on the applicable management system
            requirements identified in section&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;6.1
            through&nbsp;6.6 and the EM program requirements identified in
            section&nbsp;32 through&nbsp;35.
          </p>
          <p>
            The assessment was done through document and record reviews,
            interviews with TMPU staff and contractors, information requests and
            site visits. The Board&rsquo;s auditors were guided by the
            Board&rsquo;s published audit protocol taking into consideration
            that this assessment was only an assessment of one EM area related
            to fire hazards at its specified terminals. The Board included a
            review of TMPU&rsquo;s hazard identification, analysis and
            management and the development of risk controls related to fire. The
            Board reviewed TMPU&rsquo;s facility design, EM fire plans,
            practices, response equipment and maintenance thereof, human
            resource allocations and training, competency and exercise
            activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board&rsquo;s audit results indicated that TMPU&rsquo;s EM
            program and facilities as they relate to fire preparedness and
            response can be considered adequate within the existing regulatory
            requirements of the Board. As with other areas of its EM program,
            TMPU has exerted a considerable amount of effort and resources in
            the development of fire preparedness plans and practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the information provided by TMPU, with the exception of the
            two areas noted below, the Board did not identify any new areas of
            Non-Compliance that were not already included in the Board&rsquo;s
            previously released 2018 Final Audit Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board identified issues relating to TMPU&rsquo;s response
            planning goals for assembling staff and contractors and initiating
            extinguishment of tank fires and the design of its EM exercise
            program relating to unannounced exercises to demonstrate and test
            its response capability within its stated plans and contract
            resources.
          </p>
          <h4>
            2.3.1 Non-Compliance &ndash; Goals for Responding to Tank Fires
          </h4>
          <p>
            During the audit, TMPU indicated that its response target time to
            assemble people and resources on-site to extinguish a tank fire is
            six&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;hours. TMPU provided information, however, it
            indicated that, under certain conditions, for example, a tank with a
            low level of product, it is possible to have a tank boil-over event
            in 5.1&nbsp;hours. Boil-over events can lead to the most significant
            consequences associated with a fire. The Board is of the view that
            emergency response programs, especially goals for the timing of
            responses should be based on the analysis of the hazards associated
            with companies&rsquo; facilities and activities. Therefore, the
            Board is of the view that TMPU will need to establish program goals
            that correspond to analysis of its hazards to ensure that escalation
            of incidents does not occur due to a failure to respond in a timely
            manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is of the view that this deficiency related to
            TMPU&rsquo;s response time goals constitutes a Non-Compliance with
            OPR section&nbsp;6.3(1)(b) &ndash; &ldquo;The company shall
            establish documented policies and goals for meeting its obligations
            under section&nbsp;6, including (b) goals for the prevention of
            ruptures, liquid and gas releases, fatalities and injuries and for
            the response to incidents and emergency situations.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p><strong>Board Direction #1</strong></p>
          <p>
            1. TMPU is directed to establish and integrate the following fire
            response targets into its Emergency Response Program and fire
            response plans as described below.
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd">
            <li>
              For its Burnaby and Edmonton Terminals, TMPU must establish and
              integrate into all fire plans and associated planning and
              preparedness activities, a four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;hour response target
              time to initiate extinguishment of a full surface tank fire for
              the largest tank at each facility.
            </li>
            <li>
              TMPU must implement the direction described in 1&nbsp;a) within
              six&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;months of the issuance of this letter. TMPU must
              keep records for Board review, demonstrating the changes to
              TMPU&rsquo;s program(s) required by this direction, as well as the
              changes planned and implemented to comply with the Board&rsquo;s
              direction.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The Board notes that its review of TMPU&rsquo;s fire preparedness
            focussed on the Burnaby, Westridge and Edmonton facilities. While
            the Board has made specific directions related to the Edmonton and
            Burnaby Terminals, it expects, as with all of its audit findings,
            that TMPU will take a systematic approach to addressing these
            findings. It is therefore expected that, based on the Board&rsquo;s
            assessment and issue identification, TMPU will develop and implement
            preventive actions to assess and address response time goals and
            targets based on the analysis of its fire hazards at all of its
            regulated facilities in a manner consistent with the above direction
            and the risks identified. The Board will include the review of
            TMPU&rsquo;s activities related to this item at TMPU&rsquo;s other
            facilities in its on-going compliance verification program.
          </p>
          <h4>2.4.1 Emergency Response Exercises</h4>
          <p>
            During the audit, the Board determined that TMPU has established and
            implemented a robust emergency response exercise program for
            training its staff and contractors and for testing and practicing
            the implementation of its emergency response plans. Further, during
            the audit, TMPU demonstrated that it maintains fire response
            equipment and fire trained staff throughout its system in accordance
            with its assessment of the needs of the facilities. TMPU
            demonstrated that it has designed its plans to include utilizing
            company staff, contractors and industry responders. These groups are
            expected to assemble on-site from various locations prior to
            initiating a response. The Board confirmed that TMPU has secured
            agreements with offsite resources to respond to emergency fire
            incidents at its terminals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reviewing the design of TMPU&rsquo;s exercise plans and programs,
            however, the Board noted that TMPU does not include unannounced
            exercises to test its responders&rsquo; ability to assemble and
            respond to a tank fire. Considering the potential consequences of
            fire incidents at its tank facilities and the importance of
            demonstrating that the existing plans can be implemented utilizing
            the established response structures, the Board is of the view that
            TMPU must augment its existing exercise program with regular,
            planned, unannounced exercises that focus on its ability to assemble
            the responders to initiate a fire response at its terminals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is of the view that this gap in the exercise program
            constitutes a Non-Compliance with OPR sections&nbsp;6.5(1)(k)
            and&nbsp;32. Section&nbsp;6.5(1)(k) indicates &ldquo;A company
            shall, as part of its management system and the programs referred to
            in section&nbsp;55, (k) establish and implement a process for
            verifying that employees and other persons working with or on behalf
            of the company are trained and competent and for supervising them to
            ensure that they perform their duties in a manner that is safe,
            ensures the security of the pipeline and protects the
            environment&rdquo;. OPR section&nbsp;32 indicates &ldquo;A company
            shall develop, implement and maintain an emergency management
            program that anticipates, prevents, manages and mitigates conditions
            during an emergency that could adversely affect property, the
            environment or the safety of workers or the public.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p><strong>Board Direction #2</strong></p>
          <p>
            2. TMPU is directed to incorporate unannounced (to its response
            staff and contract staff), full deployment exercise(s) into its
            annual training and exercise plans as described below.
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd">
            <li>
              TMPU must design its unannounced exercises to test and assess its
              staff, contract and industry responders’ ability to assemble and
              respond to a full surface tank fire for the largest tank within
              each of its tank facilities within the response target times as
              described in 1&nbsp;a), above using the procedures and practices
              described within its EM Program documentation and site-specific
              fire response plans. The exercise plans must incorporate the
              various constraints to a timely response that can be reasonably
              predicted based on its fire plans and site-specific considerations
              including, but not limited to location, access and human resource
              plans.
            </li>
            <li>
              TMPU must complete unannounced, full deployment exercises at its
              Burnaby and Edmonton facilities within eight&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;months
              and ten&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;months, respectively, of receipt of this
              letter.
            </li>
            <li>
              c) Following the initial Board directed exercises, TMPU is
              directed to incorporate similar exercises applicable to its tank
              facilities into its on-going training and exercise program and on
              a schedule to be developed and implemented by TMPU that reflects
              the fire hazard analysis and associated consequences at each
              facility but not to exceed a frequency of
              three&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;years.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>3 Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The Board has completed its review of the fire preparedness
            assessment and has considered it in conjunction with the audit of
            TMPU&rsquo;s EM Program. Based on the information provided by TMPU,
            the Board has concluded that TMPU&rsquo;s processes and practices,
            have addressed the majority of the requirements associated with the
            company&rsquo;s emergency hazards and associated risk related to
            fire. This conclusion is consistent with the Board&rsquo;s
            previously released Final Audit Report for TMPU&rsquo;s EM Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of the audit and subsequent review, TMPU
            demonstrated that it has developed site-specific plans and
            procedures and the acquisition and positioning of fire response
            equipment at its terminal facilities. In addition, it undertakes
            training and exercises in aid of its preparedness and maintains
            contracts with expert responders to ensure effective responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the outcome of this review, the Board expects TMPU to
            address the two identified deficiencies by undertaking the
            directions included in this audit report addendum. No enforcement
            actions are immediately required to address the identified
            Non-Compliant findings. As the Board has provided specific direction
            for TMPU to follow, no additional Corrective and Preventive Action
            Plan is required to be filed with the Board. The Board will monitor
            and assess TMPU&rsquo;s response to these directions as part of its
            on-going compliance verification activities associated with the rest
            of this audit until they are fully implemented to assure the safety
            of people and the environment. The Board will also continue to
            monitor the implementation and effectiveness of TMPU&rsquo;s EM
            Program and management system throughout its lifecycle using
            targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
            on-going regulatory mandate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board will post this Addendum to its Final Audit Report on its
            website. Prior to publishing the addendum TMPU will be offered an
            opportunity to review the report and request redactions based on the
            Access to Information Act and Privacy Act. The Board will monitor
            and assess the implementation of its directions noted in this
            Addendum and all TMPU&rsquo;s CAPAs to confirm they are completed in
            a timely manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
            implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
            implementation and effectiveness of TMPU&rsquo;s EM Program and
            Management System through targeted compliance verification
            activities as a part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board will make its final Audit Report and TMPU&rsquo;s approved
            corrective action plan public on the Board&rsquo;s website.

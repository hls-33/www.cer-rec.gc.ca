<h2 id="smmr">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>In accordance with Section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) conducted a compliance audit of 2193914 Canada Limited Niagara Gas Transmission Limited, which are entities both owned and operated by Enbridge Gas Distribution Incorporated. (Enbridge Gas). This audit took place from 13&nbsp;October 2017 to 29&nbsp;January 2018.</p>
<p>This audit is one in a series of focused audits that the Board is conducting to examine aspects of company emergency management programs related to the identification and mitigation of hazards. The key objective of this audit was to verify that selected companies are developing fundamental components of their Emergency Management Programs in order to mitigate the hazards and associated risks of their facilities and activities. In particular, this audit examined the identification and control of hazards within a company’s:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Emergency procedures manuals;</li>
<li>Emergency related contingency and/or site-specific plans; and</li>
<li>Emergency exercise programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board conducted the audit of Enbridge Gas using the protocols attached in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report. During the audit, the Board assessed whether Enbridge Gas’ documentation, processes and activities complied with the legal requirements contained within:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>The NEB Act;</li>
<li>the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR); and</li>
<li>Canadian Standards Association (CSA)&nbsp;Z662-15 &ndash; Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems (CSA&nbsp;Z662-15).</li>
</ul>
<p>The audit focused on 12&nbsp;legal requirements primarily focusing on, but not limited to, OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;32-35 and&nbsp;6.5 (1) (c), (d), (e), (f) and&nbsp;(t), as well as relevant clauses within CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 as presented in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>.The Board did not identify any compliance issues within 10 of the legal requirements. The Board did identify two legal requirements where non-compliances were identified; the Board therefore requires that Enbridge Gas develop corrective and preventive action plans.</p>
<p>The non-compliances noted are:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Enbridge Gas did not demonstrate that it has developed and implemented an explicit, systematic, documented process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential hazards that met the requirements of the OPR for its Emergency Management Program.<br>
(<a href="#ap07" class="text-danger">Refer to Appendix&nbsp;I Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-07</a>).</li>
<li>Enbridge Gas could demonstrate multiple hazard lists from its management programs but was unable to provide an inventory ensuring that the relevant hazards were addressed within the Emergency Management Program.<br>
(<a href="#ap08" class="text-danger">Refer to Appendix&nbsp;I Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-08</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board found Enbridge Gas’ Emergency Management Program, manual, contingency plans and exercises addressed and controlled the majority and most significant of the company’s emergency management related hazards and associated risk. The two findings of non-compliance are issues of inadequate documentation, and documented process as required by the OPR.</p>
<p>Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued, Enbridge Gas must develop and submit a Corrective and Preventative Action Plan (CAPA plan) for Board approval. The plan must outline how Enbridge Gas intends to resolve the non-compliances identified by this audit to prevent recurrence and the timeline in which the corrective and preventative actions will be completed. The Board will verify that the corrective and preventative actions will be completed in a timely manner. The Board will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of Enbridge Gas’s management system and programs through targeted compliance verification activities as part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.</p>

The key components of the Enbridge Gas Emergency Management Program that were reviewed during this audit were:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>the existence of an Emergency Management Program that is applied;</li>
<li>the emergency manual;</li>
<li>contingency plans; and</li>
<li>emergency exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the audit examined the Emergency Management program in the context of Enbridge Gas’s Management System. In particular, the scope of this audit included a review of the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Policies and Goals;</li>
<li>Management of Change;</li>
<li>Training and Competency;</li>
<li>Document Control;</li>
<li>Inspection and Monitoring</li>
<li>Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control;</li>
<li>Hazard Inventory; and</li>
<li>Contingency planning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s1_3">1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
<p>During the audit, the Board assessed whether Enbridge Gas’s documentation, processes and activities within its Emergency Management Program complied with the relevant legal requirements contained within:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>The National Energy Board Act (NEB Act);</li>
<li>The National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR); and</li>
<li>Canadian Standards Association (CSA)&nbsp;Z662-15 &ndash; Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems (CSA&nbsp;Z662-15).</li>

<h2 id="s2">2.0 Audit protocol design</h2>
<p>The focused audit protocol used for this series of audits is based on the NEB OPR Management system requirements found in Section&nbsp;6 of the OPR.</p>
<p>In the audit protocol (<a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>), Enbridge Gas‘s Emergency Management program was audited against the relevant legal requirements to answer the question:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Is the company developing key components of its required Emergency Management Programs to address the hazards and associated risks of its facilities and activities with a focus on its Manuals, exercises and contingency plans?</li>
</ul>
<p>Audit Protocol (AP) questions were assigned a numbering system from&nbsp;AP-01 to&nbsp;AP-12.</p>
<p>As this is a focused audit, not all protocol items assessed the management system processes. AP-01 to&nbsp;06 and AP-12 were assessed while ensuring that linkages between the emergency program and the management system process are in place. This audit did assess the management system processes in AP-07&ndash; AP-11 to ensure the Emergency Management Program had documented processes and were following those processes to identify, analyze and mitigate hazards and potential hazards. This was a detailed assessment of hazards identification and related requirements as per OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5(1) (c) to&nbsp;(f).</p>

<td colspan="3"><p>The emergency program that oversees the NEB regulated pipelines owned and operated by Enbridge Gas Distribution (EGD or Enbridge), Niagara Gas Transmission Limited (NGTL) and 2193914 Canada Limited (2193914) is integrated and held within the EGD’s Integrated Management System.</p>
<p>EGD’s Integrated Management System (Int-MS) describes how EGD manages its business safety and stewardship. Specifically, the Int-MS outlines high-level management expectations which are common across the organization.</p>
<p>The Int-MS requirements are cascaded into six management programs through documented management programs.</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Asset MP-01</li>
<li>Emergency MP-02</li>
<li>Environmental MP-03</li>
<li>Health and Safety MP-04</li>
<li>Integrity MP-05</li>
<li>Security MP-06</li>

<p>Each program has its own manual and share common elements.</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Stakeholder engagement</li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Planning (Including MOC and Risk)</li>
<li>Resources, Competency, Awareness and Training</li>

<li>Performance Evaluation</li>
<li>Improvement</li>
<li>Documentation and Recordkeeping</li>
</ul>
<p>The Emergency Management Program document&nbsp;MP-02 provides an overview and reference of the Program’s processes, policies, and activities. Supporting documents such as emergency procedures, risk assessments, business procedures, process charts, forms etc. are not embedded in this document.</p>
<p>The Emergency Management Program provides the direction and governance for EGD’s emergency management activities, which include:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Establishing clear roles and responsibilities for achieving Emergency Management objectives and performance targets</li>
<li>Providing an Emergency Management Program that aligns with applicable industry standards and achieves safe, environmentally responsible, and reliable operations</li>
<li>Anticipating, recognizing, evaluating, and controlling emergency management hazards and risks</li>
<li>Preparing EGD to respond to emergency situations</li>
<li>Evaluating and continually improving the management of the program</li>
<li>Measuring, monitoring, and reporting emergency management performance</li>
<li>Demonstrating and reinforcing the priority of emergency management in all business activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Referenced in the MP-02 is the Emergency Management Procedures Manual.</p>

<p>The emergency procedures developed by the Company have been prepared to:</p>
<ol class="lst-spcd">
<li>Assist response personnel to determine and perform proper remedial actions in the event that an emergency occurs.</li>
<li>Ensure the safety of employees, customers and the public.</li>
<li>Maintain the continuity of supply to customers wherever possible.</li>
<li>Minimize the potential for damage to property or the loss of products and reduce the magnitude of the impact on the environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Emergency Procedures Manual is an operational document that outlines procedures for emergency response.</p>
<p>The Emergency Procedures Manual is supported by the corporate Incident Support Team (IST) Manual and is part of an Emergency Management Program that integrates emergency management and business continuity.</p>
<p>The Board verified through document review that Enbridge has developed and maintains an Emergency Management Program and Emergency Management Plans. Together, these plans address the functional areas to anticipate, prevent, manage and mitigate conditions during an emergency. The audit also verified that Enbridge tests each level of documentation during its emergency exercises.</p>
<p>The Board also verified through document review that Enbridge reviews its emergency procedures manuals, including the Emergency Procedures Manual, on an annual basis and updates the manuals when and as required.</p>
<p>Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify any issues of non-compliance in relation to this requirement.</p>

<td colspan="3"><p>The Enbridge IMS describes the overarching requirements for risk management at both the enterprise risk management level and at the management system program level.</p>
<p>The IMS has requirements for the Company to establish, implement and maintain inventory of hazards and risks. EGD’s Integrated Management System (“IM-01”), Risk Identification and Assessment.</p>
<p>IM-01, 3.1.1 Pipeline Safety Risk, EGD prevents, manages, and mitigates risks and hazards through the controls identified in Operational Processes, and through Technical Policies, Standards, and Procedures.</p>
<p>The emergency program document&nbsp;MP-02 anticipates risks to pipeline system safety that could result in an unintended release or abnormal operating conditions. Events that are at the highest risk of occurring drive the implementation of the Emergency Management Program. Incident report data, hazard assessment data, feedback from the business, and exercise results, are gathered to analyze and determine the highest risks.</p>
<p>The management develops exercise scenarios and training sessions based on the events that are at the highest risk of occurring. The identification and assessment of risk provides the types of hazards that EGD may face. The Emergency Management Program achieves these through multiple Operational Processes, through Technical Policies and through the Emergency Management Program including the Incident Investigation Program.</p>
<p>The NEB noted that Enbridge conducts various Hazard Identification activities through mandatory programs; however, Enbridge could not demonstrate a written, explicit, systematic process that would ensure that all hazards and potential hazards are identified, including those for the Emergency Management Program. In this case the procedures and activities are not formally linked together in documented process that would be considered explicit and systematic.</p>
<p>Further, the NEB did not see an explicit systematic documented process step referencing how outputs of the hazard identification various activities were integrated or used in the development and maintenance of the Emergency Management Program.</p>
<p>Enbridge is a mature utility that effectively manages the known hazards. Although Enbridge could demonstrate that it has linked hazards into its procedures and activities throughout its Emergency Management Program, it did not provide a documented process that explicitly describes how all of the hazard identification activities and their resulting inputs and outputs are systematically managed.</p>
<p>As a result of the assessment, the Board has determined that Enbridge is in non-compliance with OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5 (1)(c). The Board requires that a CAP be developed to address this non-compliance.</p></td>

<p>Enbridge conducts annual exercises along with Emergency Responders in the areas of NEB regulated pipelines. During these exercises, there is a short educational session on natural gas awareness, and references to EGD’s Emergency Agency Information Portal. This site is only available to emergency response agencies, not the public. It houses topics and information such as:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Training programs offered by EGD,</li>
<li>Safety notices,</li>
<li>Reporting emergency events,</li>
<li>High scale maps with critical lines (‘Vital Mains which include NEB pipelines),</li>
<li>Brochures and mini cards for emergency vehicles,</li>

<p>In addition to the exercises that are run each year to test the capabilities of Enbridge staff and equipment, Enbridge responds to tens of thousands of actual emergency calls each year. To date in 2017 this has included over 1200&nbsp;pipeline hits where gas was released, and over 12,000&nbsp;reports of outside gas escapes.</p>
<p>EGD must report their performance against a target of responding to emergencies within one&nbsp;hour, 90% of the time, to EGD’s Provincial Rates Regulator (Ontario Energy Board). EGD has crews working 24&nbsp;hours a day and 7&nbsp;days a week and staff who are trained, equipped, and who respond to these actual emergencies within the prescribed timeframes. <a href="#ap04">See AP-04</a></p>

<h2 id="nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II&nbsp;: Audit Process Overview</h2>
<h3>NEB Purpose and Audit Framework</h3>
<p>The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security, environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection of the environment, the Board has developed regulations requiring companies to establish and implement documented management systems applicable to specified technical management and protection programs. These management systems and programs must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the NEB Act and its associated regulations. The applicable Legislation and Regulations which come under the NEB’s mandate, responsibilities and powers include:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>National Energy Board Act and associated regulations;</li>
<li>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act and associated regulations;</li>
<li>Canada Petroleum Resources Act (sections&nbsp;28 and&nbsp;35) and associated regulations;</li>
<li>The Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II, and the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations; and</li>
<li>Any conditions contained within applicable certificates or orders issued by the Board.</li>
</ul>
<p>To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits the management system and programs of regulated companies. The Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they have established and implemented adequate and effective methods for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks. The Board’s management system requirements are described within the NEB OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 through&nbsp;6.6.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The NEB expects pipeline companies to operate in a systematic, comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board expects companies to have effective, fully developed and implemented management systems and protection programs that provide for continual improvement.</p>
<p>As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and maintain effective management systems and protection programs in order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions that may adversely affect the safety and security of the company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as the protection of property and the environment.</p>
<p>During the audit, the NEB reviews documentation and samples records provided by the company in its demonstration of compliance, and interviews corporate and regionally based staff. The NEB may also conducts separate but linked technical inspections of a representative sample of company facilities. This review enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness and implementation of the management system and programs. The NEB bases the scope and location of the inspections on the needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an inspection, they are actioned as set out by the Board’s standard inspection and enforcement practices.</p>
<div>
<p>After completing its field activities, the Board develops and issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines the Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations of the company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports are published on the Board’s website. The audit results are integrated into NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.</p>
<h3>Audit Objectives and Scope</h3>
<p>This audit evaluated the company against the legal requirements and scope outlined in the main body of the audit report.</p>
<h3>Audit Activities</h3>
<p>On 13&nbsp;October 2017, the Board informed Enbridge Gas of its intent to conduct this audit. Board audit staff then provided Enbridge Gas with an overview of the NEB audit process, the audit criteria, a request for documentation and a list of questions to answer relevant to the objectives and scope of the audit. The NEB conducted its assessment based on the responses provided by the company and the evidence gathered during the audit. Board audit staff was in contact with company staff on a regular basis to arrange and coordinate this audit. Enbridge Gas established a digital access portal for Board staff to review documentation and records.</p>
<p>On 19&nbsp;October 2017, Board audit staff conducted an opening meeting with company representatives to confirm the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. Subsequent to the opening meeting, interviews were held at the company’s office in North York, Ontario during the period 6-10&nbsp;November 2017. Throughout the audit, Board audit staff provided company representatives with daily summaries, including action items where required.</p>
<p>On 19&nbsp;October 2017, the Board held an audit pre close-out meeting with company representatives. At this meeting, Board audit staff and Enbridge Gas staff discussed potential non-compliances identified during the audit. At that time the company was provided with the opportunity to present additional evidence to rectify these potential non-compliances.</p>
<p>On 2&nbsp;November 2017, a close-out meeting was held to provide Enbridge Gas with a description of the recommendations that Board audit staff would be bringing to the Board for decision.</p>

<h2 id="nnxiii">Appendix&nbsp;III&nbsp;: Terminology and Definitions</h2>
<p>(The Board has applied the following definitions and explanations in measuring the various requirements included in this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or guidance and practices established by the Board, where available.)</p>
<p><strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated through documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to determine whether specified activities, events, conditions management systems or information about these matters conform to audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the results of the process to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Compliant:</strong> The Company has demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.</p>
<p><strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has been created in the format required and meets the described regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes. Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation, quality assurance, audit and management review processes as outlined in the OPR.</p>
<p><strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has been developed in the format required. It has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how to use the process or other requirement. The company has demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented, meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three&nbsp;months.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews have provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially utilized).</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>List:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has been kept current in the format required and continues to meet regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1) (o). With records, the company must demonstrate that it meets the records management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1) (p).</p>
<p><strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach designed to effectively manage hazards and reduce risk, and promote continual improvement. The system includes the organizational structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations related to safety, security and environmental protection.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
<p>As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set out in OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers more than the specific requirements of section&nbsp;6.1. It considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6. 4; and considers the establishment, implementation, development and/or maintenance of the processes, inventory and list described in section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1(c) and&nbsp;(d), the company’s management system and processes must apply and be applied to the programs described in section&nbsp;55.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> The Company has not demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must be developed and implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps followed in a regular and defined order, thereby allowing individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities required for completing each step.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that take place in an established order and are directed toward a specific result. A process also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A process may contain a set of procedures, if required.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management system processes applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5 (1) describes the Board’s required management system processes. In evaluating a company’s management system processes, the Board considers whether each process or requirement: has been established, implemented, developed or maintained as described within each section; whether the process is documented; and whether the process is designed to address the requirements of the process, for example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common 5 w’s and h approach (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR section. Processes must incorporate or contain linkage to procedures, where required, to meet the process requirements.</p>
<p>As the processes constitute part of the management system, the required processes must be developed in a manner that allows them to function as part of the system. The required management system is described in OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the company following its policies and goals established and required by section&nbsp;6.3.</p>
<p>Further, OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5 (1) indicates that each process must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the programs referred to in OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which considers the specific technical requirements associated with each program and is applied to and meets the process requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that a single process may not meet all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as long as they meet the process requirements (as described above), and direct the program processes to be established and implemented in a consistent manner, that allows for the management system to function as described in&nbsp;6.1.</p>
<p><strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the program is achieving the intended results.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB regulations.)</p>
<p>The program must include details on the activities to be completed, including what, by whom, when, and how. The program must also include the resources required to complete the activities.</p>

              <p>
                On 3&nbsp;October 2017, the Board informed Many Islands Pipe
                Lines (Canada) Limited (MIPL(C)L) of its intent to audit its NEB
                regulated facilities. The findings of the Audit are based upon
                an assessment of whether MIPL(C)L was compliant with the
                regulatory requirements contained within:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations,
                  including;
                </li>
                <li>the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations;</li>
                <li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                MIPL(C)L was required to demonstrate the adequacy and

                its management system and programs to meet the regulatory
                requirements listed above. Throughout this audit, the Board
                evaluated Emergency Management and related inputs and outputs as
                captured in sub-element&nbsp;2.1 Hazard Identification, Risk
                Assessment and Control of the NEB Management System and

                MIPL(C)L is required to file a Corrective and Preventive Action
                (CAPA) Plan for Board approval on or before 25&nbsp;June 2018,
                which describes the methods, timing and rationales for
                addressing the Non-Compliant findings identified through this
                audit. The Board has attached a CAPA Plan template document for
                MIPL(C)L to follow while it prepares its CAPA Plan for
                submission. An electronic copy should be requested by contacting
                the Board’s Lead Auditor, as identified below.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the CAPA Plan public and will continue to
                monitor and assess all of MIPL(C)L’s corrective actions with
                respect to this audit until they are fully implemented. The
                Board will also continue to monitor the implementation and
                effectiveness of MIPL(C)L’s management system and programs
                through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of
                its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                In accordance with Section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy
                Board Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) conducted a compliance audit of SaskEnergy Incorporated’s
                federally regulated assets, Many Islands Pipe Lines (Canada)
                Limited (MIPL(C)L). The audit took place between 3&nbsp;October
                2017 and 13&nbsp;March 2018.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit is one in a series of focused audits that the Board
                is conducting to examine specific components of companies’
                emergency management programs related to the identification and
                mitigation of hazards. The key objective of this audit was to
                verify that MIPL(C)L was developing the fundamental components
                of its Emergency Management (EM) Program in order to mitigate
                the hazards and risks associated with its facilities and
                activities. In particular, this audit examined the
                identification and control of hazards within MIPL(C)L’s:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">

                <li>
                  Emergency related contingency and/or site-specific plans; and
                </li>
                <li>Emergency exercise programs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit using the audit protocols attached
                in <a href="#nnxi">&nbsp;1</a> of this report as they apply to
                MIPL(C)L’s hazard identification and analysis activities. The
                Board assessed whether the company’s documentation, processes
                and activities complied with the legal requirements contained
                within:
              </p>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There were 12&nbsp;items listed in the audit protocol. Of those,
                there were six in which the Board did not identify any
                compliance issues and six that were found to be non-compliant.
              </p>
              <p>

                The Board notes that, at the time of the audit, MIPL(C)L was in
                the midst of implementing a Unified Management System (UMS)
                which introduced overarching processes for its protection
                programs including its EM Program. As a result, some processes
                had not been implemented for three&nbsp;months, which is the
                Board’s minimum period for a process to be considered
                established. Non-compliances were also identified in cases where
                MIPL(C)L did not demonstrate a documented process or output with
                linkages between its management system level hazard
                identification and evaluation activities and its program level
                controls such as its EM Manual and EM exercises.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the above noted non-compliances, the Board’s
                audit verified that MIPL(C)L had implemented an EM Program with
                the components to mitigate the hazards and risks associated with
                its NEB regulated assets facilities, albeit not documented to
                the extent or in the manner required by the OPR. Furthermore,
                the Board also noted that MIPL(C)L’s EM Program is
                well-integrated with and supported by SaskEnergy/TransGas’s EM
                Program for the province- wide distribution system which has
                established ties to the provincial emergency response
                organizations and requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued,
                MIPL(C)L must develop and submit a Corrective and Preventive
                Action Plan (CAPA Plan) for Board approval. The CAPA Plan must
                outline how MIPL(C)L intends to resolve the non-compliances
                identified by this audit and to prevent recurrence and the
                timeline in which corrective and preventive actions will be
                completed. The Board will verify that the corrective and
                preventive actions are completed in a timely manner. The Board
                will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                MIPL(C)L’s management system and programs through targeted
                compliance verification activities as part of its ongoing
                regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                In accordance with Section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy
                Board Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) conducted a compliance audit of SaskEnergy Incorporated’s
                federally regulated assets, Many Islands Pipe Lines (Canada)
                Limited (MIPL(C)L). An overview of the audit process and an
                explanation of definitions and abbreviations can be found in
                Appendices&nbsp;II&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;IV.

              <h3 id="s1_1">1.1 Audit Objective</h3>
              <p>
                The objective of this series of audits was to verify that
                selected companies are developing key components of its required
                Emergency Management (EM) Program consistent with the hazards
                and associated risks of its facilities and activities. The key
                components of the EM Program that were included in this audit
                are:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>Emergency procedures manuals;</li>
                <li>
                  Emergency related contingency and/or site-specific plans; and
                </li>
                <li>Emergency exercise programs.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="s1_2">1.2 Audit Scope</h3>
              <p>
                The audit scope included the requirements of the National Energy
                Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR) primarily focusing on,
                but not limited to OPR sections&nbsp;32-35 and 6.5&nbsp;(1) (c),
                (d), (e), (f) and (t) as they relate to the EM Program.
              </p>
              <h3 id="s1_3">1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
              <p>
                The Board assessed whether MIPL(C)L’s documentation, processes
                and activities complied with the legal requirements contained
                within:

              <p>
                The focused audit protocol used for this series of audits is
                based on the management system requirements found in
                Sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6 of the OPR as well as other
                requirements within the scope of the audit. Audit Protocol (AP)
                questions were assigned a numbering system from&nbsp;AP&nbsp;01
                to&nbsp;AP-12.

              <p>
                This focused audit was designed to examine particular aspects of
                EM Programs related to the identification and mitigation of
                hazards using the 12&nbsp;protocol items listed in the attached
                audit protocol. In the case of MIPL(C)L, the Board identified
                seven protocol items without any compliance issues; and five
                where non-compliance with the requirements was noted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that, at the time of the audit, MIPL(C)L was in
                the midst of implementing a Unified Management System (UMS)
                which introduced overarching processes for its protection
                programs including its EM Program. As a result, some processes
                had not been implemented for 3&nbsp;months, which is the Board’s
                minimum period for a process to be considered established.
                Non-compliances were also identified in cases where MIPL(C)L did
                not demonstrate a documented process or output with linkages
                between its management system level hazard identification and
                evaluation activities and its program level controls such as its

                Notwithstanding the above noted non-compliances, the Board’s
                audit verified that MIPL(C)L had implemented an EM Program with
                the components to mitigate the hazards and risks associated with
                its NEB regulated assets facilities, albeit not documented to
                the extent or in the manner required by the OPR. Furthermore,
                the Board also noted that MIPL(C)L’s EM Program is
                well-integrated with and supported by SaskEnergy/TransGas’s EM
                Program for the province-wide distribution system which has
                established ties to the provincial emergency response
                organizations and requirements.

                      <p><strong>Unified Management System</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        At the time of the audit, MIPL(C)L was implementing a
                        Unified Management System (UMS) which is outlined in the
                        Unified Management System framework document. This
                        document states that the purpose of the UMS includes
                        integrating the company’s operational activities and
                        technical systems with its management of human and
                        financial resources to enable the company to meet its
                        obligations. Further, it states that the UMS ensures
                        coordination between its programs including its
                        emergency management program, integrity management
                        program, pipeline control system, safety management
                        program, security management program, environmental
                        protection program and damage prevention program. The
                        UMS has been structured based on current operations,
                        systems, processes and procedures in place, and
                        establishes the processes used by the company for the
                        safety and security of the public and the company’s
                        employees, the safety and security of the pipeline, and
                        the protection of property and the environment. The UMS
                        drives operational controls as a means to ensure that
                        the obligations of the UMS are met. This is done by
                        requiring the establishment, implementation and
                        maintenance of appropriate procedures and operating
                        criteria, including those required to address abnormal
                        operating conditions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Asset Management System outlined within UMS, is a
                        coordinated set of programs that addresses the company's
                        asset management responsibilities in a manner that
                        supports the achievement of the objectives of the UMS.
                        The Asset Management System is comprised of 16 programs,
                        one of which is the Corporate Emergency Management
                        Program.

                        MIPL(C)L is governed by a Corporate Emergency Management
                        Program (CEMP) which also applies to all emergency
                        planning and response activities within SaskEnergy.
                        According to the CEMP Program Manual, the “The CEMP
                        provides specific direction to functional areas of the
                        company which are:

                        <li>Pipeline Control and Planning.”</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        The CEMP incorporates procedures that are to be used as
                        controls to mitigate and respond to threats as listed
                        within the CEMP document. The CEMP methodology separates
                        “threats” into pre-event (mitigation and preparedness)
                        and post-event (response and recovery). Preparedness
                        includes; forecasting the types of emergencies that
                        could occur and the people, equipment, organization and
                        training that would be required to respond effectively.

                      <p><strong>Emergency Procedures Manual</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        The Emergency Response Manual that applies to MIPL(C)L
                        includes details of each facility operated by MIPL(C)L,
                        schematics, guidelines for response and reporting and an
                        emergency contact list for each pipeline. The manual
                        contains procedures to be followed for events such as
                        responding to chemical spills, odour releases or spills,
                        and civil disturbances.

                        In accordance with the annual review process,

                        revisions of the manual since 2015. The Board notes that
                        these updates have occurred in accordance with the
                        requirements of OPRs.&nbsp;32&nbsp;(1.1) which states:

                        Based on the review conducted and considering the scope
                        of this audit, the Board did not identify any issues of

                        As part of the CEMP, SaskEnergy/TransGas Engineering,
                        has developed a functional level plan for the programs
                        under the CEMP umbrella. This plan includes a listing

                        locations on its transmission system (outside of manned
                        stations), it is expected that personnel will respond to
                        the locations within 1.5&nbsp;hours, more than 95% of
                        the time. Response time expectations are also outlined
                        for manned locations.

                        details to what needs to be completed in developing
                        qualification plans and outlines responsibilities to be

                        During the audit, MIPL(C)L stated that emergency
                        response exercises are considered to be effective tools
                        for training staff for response and to evaluate their
                        competency in responding to emergency events. Over the
                        2016-2017&nbsp;year, 30&nbsp;tabletop exercises
                        completed throughout the company, two of which were
                        specific to the transportation system. In addition, two
                        of the three simulation exercises were specific to
                        MIPL(C)L. It was also noted that a mock exercise is
                        scheduled to be completed for MIPL(C)L in 2018.

                        MIPL(C)L demonstrated through documentation provided
                        that it has developed an Operations Training Matrix.
                        This matrix identifies required training courses for
                        positions within the Operations team. Included within
                        these courses is the Online Emergency Response 101
                        Course which is mandatory for most positions. Incident
                        Command System (ICS)&nbsp;100 and ICS&nbsp;200 are also
                        included within the training matrix; however, these
                        courses are only considered mandatory for selected
                        positions. Based on documentation reviewed, the NEB

                        The NEB was advised during interviews that the Human

                        management training within its Learning Management
                        System. This change will represent an improvement to
                        existing practice as going forward. The system will
                        monitor and report on training requirements and
                        certification expiries. According to MIPL(C)L, contract
                        personnel do not have responsibilities related emergency
                        response on behalf of the company.

                        Based on the review conducted and considering the scope

                        During interviews and document review, MIPL(C)L
                        indicated that it adheres to the corporate UMS
                        Documentation Management Procedure (DMP). First released
                        in 2016, the DMP provides guidance on the preparation
                        and maintenance of UMS related documentation and
                        includes requirements of UMS documents to include
                        identification of document owner, reviewer, and record
                        of annual review(s) and updates. Direction includes
                        guidelines for; creating, revising, reviewing,
                        approving, and deleting UMS documents. According to the
                        document, this procedure applies to Program, Plan and
                        System owners and is to be applied to UMS controlled
                        documents. During the audit, the NEB reviewed several
                        management system level process documents that appeared

                        Review of the MIPL(C)L Emergency Response Manual
                        identified that it is version controlled on the CEMP
                        SharePoint site &ndash; MIPL(C) L Emergency Response.
                        Distribution of the document is primarily electronic
                        through the SharePoint site where access to versions is
                        based on site permissions. Additionally, it was
                        identified that four (4) hard copies are provided to
                        select recipients, including the NEB, and printouts are
                        considered uncontrolled.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Over the course of the audit, MIPL(C)L demonstrated that
                        its Corporate Emergency Management Manual was subject to
                        review, revision and updating when changes were
                        required. The NEB noted, however, that the current
                        review, approval and updating process is unique to the
                        Emergency Manual and therefore MIPL(C)L did not
                        demonstrate this document is subject to the overarching
                        management system level DMP document control and
                        approval process.

                      <p>
                        The NEB reviewed other EM Program documentation to
                        verify its conformance to the DMP and noted the
                        following inconsistencies:

                          The MIPL(C)L Emergency Response Manual is dated
                          “September 2017”, has no watermark, a revision history
                          and approval signature that are not consistent with

                      <p>
                        Given the inconsistencies noted between the EM
                        documentation and the other management system
                        documentation that was provided, the Board determined
                        that MIPL(C)L has not consistently implemented a process
                        for preparing, reviewing, revising and controlling those
                        documents, including a process for obtaining approval of
                        the documents by the appropriate authority for its EM
                        Program documentation. Therefore, MIPL(C)L is in
                        non-compliance with OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)(o) as
                        it relates to its EM Program documentation. The Board
                        requires that a CAPA Plan be developed to address this
                        non-compliance.

                        During the audit, MIPL(C)L discussed several activities
                        it conducts to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of
                        its EM Program. These activities include audits,
                        emergency exercises and documented de-briefs for
                        emergency events that required ICS.

                      <p>
                        SaskEnergy/TransGas Audit Services is responsible for
                        the internal audits of company processes and programs on
                        a three-year basis. Audit Services completed an audit of
                        the EM Program in 2016 to determine if the CEMP meets
                        the requirements of the OPR. The final report was
                        released 6&nbsp;February 2017 containing one observation
                        for correction. The issue was assigned to a Management
                        Sponsor to develop an appropriate action plan to address
                        identified gaps, with a due date of 31&nbsp;March 2018.
                        In this case, the action required updating emergency
                        impact zones and lists for MIPL(C)L pipelines. According
                        to MIPL(C)L, this action has been addressed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        MIPL(C)L also evaluates and monitors the adequacy of its
                        EM Program by using debriefs to capture lessons learned
                        following events that required the activation of ICS.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It was noted during the audit that SaskEnergy/TransGas
                        runs various emergency management exercises throughout
                        its system on a regular basis. These exercises include
                        practices for gathering direct and indirect participant
                        feedback that is incorporated into the update of EM
                        procedures, EM training and when evaluating emergency
                        response equipment. Emergency response exercises are
                        documented and may include debriefings to identify
                        deficiencies or possible improvements. The Board noted
                        that the 2012 Mock Exercise identified several
                        recommendations for consideration by EM Program
                        management.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Based on the review conducted and considering the scope
                        of this audit, the Board did not identify any issues of
                        non-compliance in relation to this requirement.

                        SaskEnergy/TransGas provided the Hazard Identification
                        Process for review. This process is utilized throughout
                        the organization for identifying hazards in the
                        workplace and for operations. Once hazards are
                        identified, employees use the REO (Report Everything
                        Online) System to capture hazards, near misses and
                        incidents. Within REO, each hazard is classified as
                        personal, public, or as a process safety hazard. Hazards
                        are then risk ranked, and corrective actions applied if
                        risk cannot be managed immediately. Similar procedures
                        are followed for near misses and incidents.

                        The Policy for Internal Reporting of Hazards, Incident
                        and Near Misses includes an expectation of workers to
                        identify hazards, incidents and near misses. The Policy
                        also states that “Management will review all documented
                        reports and take appropriate action relative to the
                        seriousness of the risk identified.” Further, all
                        employees are encouraged to be actively observing their
                        work places and work tasks to identify possible risks
                        and to report these within the REO system.

                        The Field Level Risk Assessment is designed for
                        employees to identify potential hazards that may exist
                        for the task and assign the corresponding control to

                        Although the company demonstrated that it has
                        implemented several hazard identification activities, it
                        did not provide documentation to demonstrate how the
                        hazards or potential hazards identified through the
                        mechanisms are to be captured in REO, captured in a
                        hazard inventory or analyzed for their application to
                        the EM Program. For example, as part of the UMS, the
                        Process Safety Management (PSM) Gap Registry and
                        Management process outlines the methodology to identify
                        hazards and perform standardized risk assessments, and
                        provides corrective and preventive action items. The
                        inputs of this process originate from monthly meetings
                        with subject matter experts reviewing Process Safety
                        incidents in REO, and long term action items from Root

                        Additionally, hazards are identified within the All
                        Hazards Risk Assessment Process which describes the
                        process of reviewing the Risk and Hazards inventory as
                        well as defining the relevance and impact of those risks
                        and hazards. In reviewing this document, the All Hazards
                        Risk Assessment Process does not include a methodology
                        or process to analyze hazards and potential hazards.

                        As described above, MIPL(C)L conducts various hazard
                        identification activities, especially with respect to
                        worker safety. However, the company did not demonstrate
                        that it has an explicit, systematic process to identify
                        and analyze hazards and potential hazards related to the
                        EM Program. Further, the company did not provide an
                        explicit systematic documented process describing how
                        outputs of the hazard identification various activities
                        were integrated into or analyzed in the development and

                        At the time of the audit, MIPL(C)L provided an All

                        potential hazards. This list includes threats and
                        hazards categorized within nine threat groups including:

                        Within this list, each threat has been assigned a
                        priority level and describes the consequence and
                        likelihood of occurrence and whether or not there is a
                        procedure in place at SaskEnergy to address the issue.
                        The NEB could not confirm the origin of the document
                        because it did not follow the SaskEnergy document
                        control template and was therefore not dated or signed.

                      <p>
                        Upon review of this All Hazard List, the NEB found that
                        it does not constitute an inventory of identified
                        hazards and potential hazards related to its federally
                        regulated operations. Rather, this document appears to
                        be a tool used in emergency response planning to verify
                        that potential emergency event types that could impact
                        provincial infrastructure have been accounted for,
                        considered and mitigated where required by SaskEnergy.

                        The NEB determined that the list does not meet the

                        because it does not contain all of the hazards and
                        potential hazards related to federally regulated
                        pipelines nor is it an output of the hazard
                        identification process.

                      <p>
                        MIPL(C)L also provided the All Hazards Risk Assessment
                        Process. According to the document, its purpose is to
                        describe the process of reviewing the Saskatchewan Risk
                        and Hazard Inventory and define the relevance and impact
                        of the risks and hazards SaskEnergy’s environment. A
                        review of the document indicated that it does not
                        include a methodology to be followed to complete these
                        hazard assessments nor does it link the maintenance of
                        an inventory of identified hazards and potential hazards
                        for its federally regulated pipeline operations.

                        Although MIPL(C)L provided a list of all-hazards, the
                        Board determined that the list did not constitute an
                        inventory of hazards and potential hazards related to
                        its federally regulated pipeline facilities. In

                        describes the maintenance of this list or its function
                        within or link to the MIPL(C)L EM Program, therefore it

                        MIPL(C)L provided several documents that described the
                        evaluation of risk occurring at the corporate and EM
                        Program level. These documents included:

                      <p>
                        According to MIPL(C)L, this process is used to review
                        the provincially managed All Hazard List and assess the
                        relevance and impact of the risks and hazards to
                        determine levels of preparedness. However, as noted in
                        AP-08 above, the document does not provide a specific,
                        process describing the methodology to be followed to
                        evaluate and manage the risks. In addition, as this
                        document was released in October 2017, it did not meet
                        the Board’s definition of established because it had not
                        been in place for 90&nbsp;days at the time of the audit.

                        the UMS. The purpose of this process is to help the
                        organization apply a structured and collaborative
                        approach to identify, assess and evaluate risks and
                        determine controls in order to manage the risks

                        The Risk Assessment Process document includes
                        4&nbsp;levels of risk. These are listed as:

                        A review of the documentation found that there was a
                        lack of clarity as to what exactly would constitute a
                        risk at each of these levels and how they are linked to
                        one another. Following the review of these documents,
                        the NEB could not determine how the UMS Risk Assessment
                        Process identifies the risks at each of the levels or
                        how it accounts for and integrates any identified
                        hazards at the EM Program Level.

                        This document is maintained by the company’s Internal
                        Audit Services group. It identifies 16 high level risks
                        to the company and includes a corresponding list of
                        controls that are available to be applied to manage the
                        risks to a level that is acceptable to the company.

                      <p>
                        Further review of the document found that “the
                        Inadequate capability to respond to an emergency” was
                        the only risk on the Register directly related to the EM
                        Program. MIPL(C)L did not provide records to demonstrate
                        that this risk from the EM Program was the result of a
                        risk evaluation process. Instead, MIPL(C)L indicated
                        that this risk was added to the Register in 2014 in
                        order to proactively evaluate the controls in place.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Due to the fact that this risk was added to the Register
                        without adhering to a process that includes the
                        evaluation and management of identified hazards and
                        potential hazards, the NEB determined that this document
                        does not meet the requirements of the OPR.

                      <p>
                        Following the review of each of the documents outlined
                        above, the Board has determined that although some
                        evaluation of risks is occurring related to the EM
                        Program, MIPL(C)L did not demonstrate that it has
                        implemented a documented, systematic process for
                        evaluating and managing the risks associated with
                        identified hazards, including the risks related to
                        normal and abnormal operating conditions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As a result of the above assessment, the Board has
                        determined that MIPL(C)L is in non-compliance with
                        OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)(e). The Board requires
                        that a CAPA Plan be developed to address this
                        non-compliance.

                        an overarching coordinated approach between the
                        emergency programs developed at various levels within
                        the Company. The CEMP Manual “incorporates more than
                        fifty control processes that are used to mitigate and
                        respond to threats.” In the document,
                        <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> lists fifty control
                        that are used to mitigate and respond to the threats
                        listed in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> that
                        reflect those listed in CSA-Z662-15.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Following a review of the controls listed in<a
                          href="#nnxi"
                        >
                          Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                        >, the Board found that the list of controls appears to
                        be based on the generally accepted hazards associated
                        with gas facilities including:
                      </p>
                      <ul class="lst-spcd">
                        <li>the safety manual;</li>

                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        The Board found that while the CEMP document includes a
                        list of various activities, documents and organizations
                        that could contribute to the control of a hazard or
                        threat, the CEMP does not describe the process that was
                        used to develop or maintain this list of controls.
                        Furthermore, the document does not describe how the list
                        of controls has been applied or evaluated to ensure that
                        these controls are adequate for addressing the threats
                        listed by category in
                        <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>. Additionally,
                        this list of threats is limited to the threat categories
                        as outlined in CSA&nbsp;Z662-15, which are threats to
                        the integrity of the facilities and would not be
                        considered to be appropriately all inclusive of the
                        hazards and risks that would normally pertain to an EM
                        Program. For example, the list does not address all of
                        the hazards and risks associated with any high
                        consequence areas along the facility rights of way have
                        been included or addressed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, MIPL(C)L did not demonstrate that this list is
                        the result of an established and implemented process to
                        be followed for developing and implementing these
                        controls that has been applied within the EM Program.

                      <p>
                        While the CEMP document includes a list of various
                        activities, documents and organizations that could
                        contribute to the control of a hazard or threat, the
                        CEMP does not describe the process that was used to
                        develop or maintain this list of controls. Furthermore,
                        the document does not describe and no records were
                        provided to show how the list of controls has been
                        applied or evaluated to ensure that these controls are
                        adequate for addressing the threats listed by category

                      <p><strong>Communicating Controls</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        During the audit, MIPL(C)L demonstrated several formal
                        and informal methods to communicate controls related to
                        emergency management to its staff including training,
                        documented procedures, bulletins and information
                        sharing.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        MIPL(C)L maintains a documented procedures library known
                        collectively as the Construction, Operation and
                        Maintenance Procedures (COMPs). The documented
                        procedures library is known collectively as the
                        Construction, Operation and Maintenance Procedures
                        (COMPs). The Board noted that this library contains
                        several documented procedures developed to address the
                        hazards associated with incident response.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In addition, MIPL(C)L demonstrated that it communicates
                        hazards by issuing company-wide bulletins and notices
                        when safety issues deemed significant arise. For
                        example, Hazard Highlights are distributed to staff on a
                        regular basis to communicate various hazards and the
                        recommended associated controls. Another example that
                        was provided for review was the Safety Bulletin which
                        was sent to staff to communicate potential hazards
                        related to not taking proper precautions when responding
                        to incidents involving overpressures where controls such
                        as valves may not function as designed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Staff safety meetings, tailgate meetings, and emergency
                        exercise debriefs, are also forums where MIPL(C)L
                        informs employees of controls that can be used if
                        exposed to identified hazards or risks.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With respect to the communication of hazards and
                        controls to the public, MIPL(C)L provided documentation
                        including records indicating that it did so through its
                        Public Awareness Program. These included publications
                        and brochures such as:
                      </p>
                      <ul class="lst-spcd">
                        <li>2017 MIPL(C)L Neighbour Letter;</li>
                        <li>Guide to Landowners; and</li>
                        <li>
                          regular face to face meetings with landowners and
                          tenants living on land in proximity to MIPL(C)L
                          facilities.

                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        While MIPL(C)L demonstrated that it is communicating its
                        controls to employees and members of the public who are
                        exposed to the risks, it did not provide a process that
                        ties the development and implementation of controls for
                        the identified hazards and risks with the communication
                        of those controls to anyone who is exposed to the risks.
                      </p>
                      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        Based on the assessment, the Board notes that MIPL(C)L
                        has developed a generic list of controls that could be
                        applied to identified threats. The Board also notes that
                        MIPL(C)L demonstrated various means to communicate
                        controls to those persons who may be exposed to these
                        hazards or risks. However, the company did not
                        demonstrate that it has established and implemented a
                        documented, explicit process or processes for the
                        development of appropriate controls based on identified
                        hazards that includes communicating those controls
                        within the EM Program.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As a result of the assessment, the Board has determined
                        that MIPL(C)L is in non-compliance with
                        OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)(f). The Board requires
                        that a CAPA Plan be developed to address this
                        non-compliance.

                        During interviews and through document review, MIPL(C)L
                        indicated that it includes contingency planning within
                        its emergency response activities as part of its
                        execution of the Incident Command System (ICS). In
                        addition, there are references to contingency planning
                        within its emergency response procedures. During
                        emergencies that affect multiple agencies, MIPL(C)L
                        works with the Province of Saskatchewan and participates
                        in the Saskatchewan Emergency Plan. Under this Plan,
                        contingency planning is the responsibility of the

                        include safety procedures for personnel located at
                        emergency sites. MIPL(C)L indicated that its staff are

                        Awareness Plan administered by SaskEnergy/TransGas. The

                        through interviews with company representatives that the
                        company makes relevant sections of the Emergency
                        Response manuals or information therein available to
                        local authorities. Manuals and information is provided
                        digitally and/or hard copy through a controlled system

                        During the interviews, MIPL(C)L stated that the company
                        regularly verifies its ability to respond to an
                        emergency using various types of exercises including
                        table tops and full mock exercises. These exercises are
                        used to assess the ability to respond as well as the
                        suitability of the procedures and response plans.
                        Although the majority of the exercises were conducted on
                        the provincially regulated distribution system,
                        documentation provided during the audit indicated that
                        two of the thirty tabletop exercises and two simulation
                        exercises were completed in 2016/2017 that were specific
                        to the MIPL(C)L assets. It was also noted that a mock
                        exercise is scheduled to be completed for MIPL(C)L in
                        2018 as well.

                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection
                of the environment, the Board has developed regulations
                requiring companies to establish and implement documented
                management systems applicable to specified technical management
                and protection programs. These management systems and programs
                must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the
                NEB Act and its associated regulations. The applicable
                Legislation and Regulations which come under the NEB’s mandate,
                responsibilities and powers include:

                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks. The
                Board’s management system requirements are described within the
                National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR),
                sections&nbsp;6.1 through&nbsp;6.6.
              </p>
              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                The NEB expects pipeline companies to operate in a systematic,
                comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board
                expects companies to have effective, fully developed and
                implemented management systems and protection programs that
                provide for continual improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and
                maintain effective management systems and protection programs in
                order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions
                that may adversely affect the safety and security of the
                company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as
                the protection of property and the environment.
              </p>
              <div>
                <p>
                  During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and samples
                  records provided by the company in its demonstration of
                  compliance and interviews corporate and regionally based
                  staff. The Board also conducts separate but linked technical
                  inspections of a representative sample of company facilities.
                  This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness
                  and implementation of the management system and programs. The
                  Board bases the scope and location of the inspections on the
                  needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s
                  standard inspection processes and practices. Although they
                  inform the audit, inspections are considered independent of
                  the audit. If unsafe or non-compliant activities are
                  identified during an inspection, they are actioned as set out
                  by the Board’s standard inspection and enforcement practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                  issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines
                  the Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations of the
                  company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory
                  requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report,
                  the company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan
                  to address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports
                  are published on the Board’s website. The audit results are
                  integrated into NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to
                  compliance assurance.
                </p>
                <h3>Audit Objectives and Scope</h3>
                <p>
                  This audit evaluated the company against the legal
                  requirements and scope outlined in the main body of the audit
                  report.
                </p>
                <h3>Audit Activities</h3>
                <p>
                  On October&nbsp;13, 2017, the Board informed
                  TransGas/SaskEnergy (Many Islands Pipe Lines (Canada) Limited)
                  of its intent to audit. Board staff then provided
                  TransGas/SaskEnergy (Many Islands Pipe Lines (Canada) Limited)
                  with an overview of the NEB audit process, the audit criteria,
                  a request for documentation and a list of questions to answer
                  relevant to the objectives and scope of the audit. The NEB
                  conducted its assessment based on the responses provided by
                  the company and the evidence gathered during the audit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Board staff was in contact with company staff on a regular
                  basis to arrange and coordinate this audit.
                  TransGas/SaskEnergy (Many Islands Pipe Lines (Canada) Limited)
                  established a digital access portal for Board staff to review
                  documentation and records.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 11&nbsp;December 2017, Board Staff conducted an opening
                  meeting with company representatives in Regina to confirm the
                  Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. Subsequent to the
                  opening meeting, interviews were held at the company’s office
                  in Regina on 11-12&nbsp;December 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the audit, NEB staff provided company
                  representatives with daily summaries, including action items
                  where required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 9&nbsp;February, 2018, the Board sent an audit pre
                  close-out Information Request (IR) to the company. This IR
                  outlined potential non-compliances identified during the
                  audit. At that time the company was provided with the
                  opportunity to present additional evidence to rectify these
                  potential non-compliances.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                On 13&nbsp;March, 2018, the Board sent a close-out summary to
                the company representatives to present the assessment of
                findings noted during the audit.

                Appendix&nbsp;III&nbsp;: Terminology and Definitions
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Board has applied the following definitions and explanations
                in measuring the various requirements included in this audit.
                They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or guidance
                and practices established by the Board, where available.
              </p>

                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> The company has demonstrated that it
                has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses
                the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains
                the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described

                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR

              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained
                on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others
                working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the
                process or other requirement. Records and interviews have
                provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as
                prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially
                utilized).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Inventory:</strong> A documented compilation of required
                items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be
                integrated into the management system and management system
                processes without further definition or analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>List:</strong> A documented compilation of required
                items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be

                processes without further definition or analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)(o). With records, the company
                must demonstrate that it meets the records management
                requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)(p).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR
                sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach
                designed to effectively manage hazards and reduce risk, and
                promote continual improvement. The system includes the
                organizational structures, resources, accountabilities,
                policies, processes and procedures required for the organization
                to meet its obligations related to safety, security and
                environmental protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to
                its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set
                out in OPR sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in
                evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers
                more than the specific requirements of section&nbsp;6.1. It
                considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and
                implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its
                management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its
                organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6. 4; and
                considers the establishment, implementation, development and/or
                maintenance of the processes, inventory and list described in
                section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections 6.1(c) and (d), the
                company’s management system and processes must apply and be
                applied to the programs described in section&nbsp;55.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> The company has not demonstrated
                that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and
                procedures that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action
                plan must be developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order thereby allowing
                individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe
                manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities
                and authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that
                take place in an established order and are directed toward a
                specific result. A process also outlines the roles,
                responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A
                process may contain a set of procedures, if required.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management system processes
                applicable to its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                OPR section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1) describes the Board’s required
                management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                developed or maintained as described within each section;
                whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                designed to address the requirements of the process, for example
                a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and
                potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required
                actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for
                staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The
                Board considers this to constitute a common 5 w’s and h approach
                (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that
                the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may
                therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as
                they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate
                any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR section.
                Processes must incorporate or contain linkage to procedures,
                where required to meet the process requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the processes constitute part of the management system, the
                required processes must be developed in a manner that allows
                them to function as part of the system. The required management
                system is described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must
                be designed in a manner that contributes to the company
                following its policies and goals established and required by
                section&nbsp;6.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1) indicates that each
                process must be part of the management system
                <strong>and</strong> the programs referred to in OPR
                section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be compliant, the process must
                also be designed in a manner which considers the specific
                technical requirements associated with each program and is
                applied to and meets the process requirements within each
                program. The Board recognizes that single process may not meet
                all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to
                establish governance processes as long as they meet the process
                requirements (as described above) and direct the program
                processes to be established and implemented in a consistent
                manner that allows for the management system to function as
                described in 6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program
                outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in
                other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company
                regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the
                program is achieving the intended results.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB
                regulations.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The program must include details on the activities to be
                completed including what, by whom, when, and how. The program
                must also include the resources required to complete the
                activities.

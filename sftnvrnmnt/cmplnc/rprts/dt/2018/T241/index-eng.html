              <p>
                In accordance with Section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy
                Board Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) conducted a compliance audit of TransCanada Keystone
                Pipeline GP Ltd. (TransCanada). This audit took place from
                12&nbsp;September to 2&nbsp;November 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit is one in a series of focused audits that the Board
                is conducting to examine particular aspects of company emergency
                management programs related to the identification and mitigation
                of hazards. The key objective of this audit was to verify that
                selected companies are developing fundamental components of
                their Emergency Management Programs to be effective in the
                mitigation of the hazards and associated risks of their
                facilities and activities.&nbsp; In particular, this audit
                examined the identification and control of hazards within a
                company’s:
              </p>

                <li>
                  Emergency related contingency and/or site-specific plans; and
                </li>
                <li>Emergency exercise programs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit of TransCanada using the protocols
                attached in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report.
                During the audit, the Board assessed whether TransCanada’s
                documentation, processes and activities complied with the legal
                requirements contained within:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>The National Energy Board Act;</li>
                <li>
                  The National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR);
                  and
                </li>
                <li>

                  Pipeline Systems (CSA&nbsp;Z662-15).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The audit focused on 12&nbsp;legal requirements primarily
                focusing on, but not limited to, OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;32-35
                and&nbsp;6.5(1) (c), (d), (e), (f) and (t) as well as relevant
                clauses within CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 as presented in
                <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>.The Board did not identify
                any compliance issues within 10 of the sections. The remaining
                two&nbsp;sections where non-compliances were identified, the
                Board requires that TransCanada develop corrective and
                preventive actions plans.
              </p>
              <p>The non-compliances noted are:</p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  TransCanada did not demonstrate that it has developed and
                  implemented an explicit, systematic, documented process for
                  identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential hazards
                  that met the requirements of the
                  OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5(1)(c) for its Emergency Management
                  Program.<br />

                </li>
                <li>
                  TransCanada did not demonstrate that it has established and
                  implemented a process for developing contingency plans for
                  abnormal events that may occur during emergency situations
                  that met the requirements of the
                  OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5(1)(t). <br />
                  (<a href="#ap11" class="text-danger"

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Within the scope of the audit, the Board found TransCanada’s
                Emergency Management program, manual, contingency plans and
                exercises addressed and controlled the majority and most
                significant of the company’s emergency management related
                hazards and associated risks. The audit also determined that
                TransCanada conducts various activities and practices related to
                the identification and control of hazards in its Emergency
                Management Program. The two findings of Non-Compliance were
                related to the formal and adequate documentation of processes as
                required by the NEB OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued,
                TransCanada must develop and submit a Corrective and
                Preventative Action plan (CAPA) for Board approval. The CAPA
                must outline how TransCanada intends to resolve the
                non-compliances identified by this audit to prevent recurrence
                and the timeline in which corrective and preventative actions
                will be completed. The Board will verify that the corrective and
                preventive actions are completed in a timely manner. The Board
                will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                TransCanada’s management system and programs through targeted
                compliance verification activities as part of its ongoing
                regulatory mandate.

              <h2 id="s1">1.0 Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                In accordance with Section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy
                Board Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) conducted a compliance audit of TransCanada Keystone
                Pipeline GP Ltd. (TransCanada). An overview of the audit process
                and an explanation of definitions and abbreviations can be found
                in Appendices&nbsp;II &ndash; IV.
              </p>
              <h3 id="s1_1">1.1 Audit Objective</h3>
              <p>
                The objective of this audit was to verify that TransCanada is
                developing key components of its required Emergency Management
                Program consistent with the hazards and associated risks of its
                facilities and activities for its federally regulated Keystone
                Pipeline assets (Keystone).&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <h3 id="s1_2">1.2 Audit Scope</h3>
              <p>
                The audit scope included the relevant requirements of the
                National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR)
                primarily focusing on, but not limited to,
                OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;32-35 and 6.5(1) (c), (d), (e), (f) and
                (t), as well as relevant clauses within CSA&nbsp;Z662-15. The
                key components of the TransCanada Emergency Management Program
                that were reviewed during this audit were:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  the existence of an Emergency Management (EM) Program that is
                  applied to the Keystone Pipeline;
                </li>
                <li>the emergency manual;</li>
                <li>contingency plans; and</li>
                <li>emergency exercises.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, the audit examined the EM program in the context of
                TransCanada’s Management System for Keystone. In particular, the
                scope of this audit included a review of the following
                requirements:
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>Policies and Goals;</li>
                <li>Management of Change;</li>
                <li>Training and Competency;</li>
                <li>Document Control;</li>
                <li>Inspection and Monitoring</li>
                <li>Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control;</li>
                <li>Hazard Inventory; and</li>
                <li>Contingency planning.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="s1_3">1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
              <p>
                During the audit, the Board assessed whether TransCanada’s
                documentation, processes and activities within its EM Program
                complied with the relevant legal requirements contained within:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>The National Energy Board Act;</li>
                <li>
                  The National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR);
                  and

              <h2 id="s2">2.0 Audit protocol design</h2>
              <p>
                The focused audit protocol used for this series of audits is
                based on the NEB Management system requirements found in
                Section&nbsp;6 of the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the audit protocol (<a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>),
                TransCanada‘s EM Program was audited against the relevant legal
                requirements to answer the question:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  Is the company developing key components of its required
                  emergency management programs to address the hazards and
                  associated risks of its facilities and activities with a focus
                  on its manuals, exercises and contingency plans?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Audit Protocol (AP) questions were assigned a numbering system
                from&nbsp;AP-01 to&nbsp;AP-12.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a focused audit, not all protocol items included an
                assessment of the management system process required in the OPR.
                For&nbsp;AP-01-06 and&nbsp;AP-12, companies were assessed based
                on the linkages that could be demonstrated between the emergency
                program and the management system process in place. The audit
                did not assess the adequacy or effectiveness of the corporate
                management system process itself. Rather, emergency management
                documentation was reviewed to verify that the all documents
                adhered to the requirements of the corporate document control
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the examination of&nbsp;AP-07-AP-11, this audit assessed the
                management system processes as implemented within the EM
                Program. This assessment was done to verify that the company had
                implemented, documented corporate management system processes to
                drive the identification, analysis and mitigation of hazards and
                potential hazards as per OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5.1(c)
                to&nbsp;(f).

              <p>
                The TransCanada Keystone Pipeline System (Keystone) is an oil
                pipeline system in Canada that extends into the United States.
                The pipeline was commissioned in 2010 and is owned solely by
                TransCanada Corporation. It runs from the Western Canadian
                Sedimentary Basin in Alberta to delivery points in Illinois and
                Texas, and then on to local refineries via third party
                pipelines. It also connects to oil tank farms and an oil
                pipeline distribution center in Cushing, Oklahoma. The Canadian
                portion of the pipeline runs from Hardisty, Alberta, east into
                Manitoba where it turns south and crosses the border at Haskett
                Manitoba into North Dakota.

              <p>
                The Board found TransCanada’s Emergency Management program,
                manual, contingency plans and exercises addressed and controlled
                the majority and most significant of the company’s emergency
                management related hazards and associated risk. TransCanada
                demonstrated that it is committed to its Emergency Management
                Program, and according to records reviewed, has been for many
                years. The two Non-Compliance findings, as presented in
                <a href="#t1">Table&nbsp;1</a> and
                <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>,, were issues of incomplete

                        TransCanada’s Operational Management System (TOMS) is

                        the mandated core programs including the EM Program.
                        TOMS outlines expectations of how TransCanada’s assets
                        are designed, constructed, operated and decommissioned.

                        Under TOMS, standards are the minimum expectations or
                        requirements for a specific function including the
                        Emergency Management Corporate Program. According to its
                        organizational structure, TransCanada’s EM Program is
                        developed and maintained at the head office and
                        implemented in the regional offices with designated
                        local staff.

                      <p>
                        TransCanada’s EM Program documentation follows a tiered
                        structure. At the corporate level, TransCanada has
                        developed an Emergency Management Corporate Program
                        Manual (The Manual) that describes the company's EM
                        Program and the processes. This manual is considered a
                        Tier&nbsp;1 document and has been developed to guide
                        Facilities, Regions, and Support departments in
                        developing and executing emergency preparedness
                        activities within each region.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Manual outlines the high level program components
                        and provides the framework and direction that triggers
                        the business units such as TransCanada Keystone to
                        develop Tier&nbsp;2 Emergency response plans.
                        Tier&nbsp;2 Emergency Response Plans are designed to
                        contain specific resources including contact
                        information, procedures and maps for particular
                        locations and facilities. All Tier&nbsp;2 Emergency
                        Response Plans follow the same outline across the
                        company.

                        The Tier&nbsp;2 Keystone Pipeline System Emergency
                        Response Plan latest revision of 31&nbsp;October 2016
                        includes a signed approval from the Vice President of
                        Safety, Quality, and Compliance. The plan has been
                        reviewed annually since its development in 2009.
                        According to TransCanada EM staff, the Tier&nbsp;2 plan
                        document is updated when substantial changes are made to
                        the pipeline system, when deemed necessary by the
                        company, or as required by regulatory changes.

                        The corporate EM Program states that Emergency Response
                        Plans must be created for all major facilities, U.S. and
                        Canadian power facilities, gas storage facilities,
                        compressor stations, metering stations deemed critical
                        by the region/facilities and sensitive areas
                        (pipelines). These site specific plans are categorized
                        as Tier&nbsp;3 plans.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Tier&nbsp;3 Emergency Response Plans are maintained by
                        at the region or facility level. When requested, the
                        company's Emergency Management Team provides guidance
                        and consultation during the development and maintenance
                        of these plans.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Board noted that TransCanada has developed three
                        types of Tier&nbsp;3 Emergency Response Plans:
                      </p>
                      <ol class="lst-spcd">
                        <li>Site specific Emergency Response Plans;</li>
                        <li>Geographic Response Plans; and</li>
                        <li>Facility Response Plans.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>
                        The Board verified through document review that
                        TransCanada has developed and maintains an EM Program,
                        and Emergency Management Plans, including a plan
                        specific to the Keystone Pipeline System. Together,
                        these plans address the functional areas to anticipate,
                        prevent, manage and mitigate conditions during an
                        emergency. The audit also verified that TransCanada
                        tests each level of documentation during its emergency
                        exercises.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Based on the review conducted and considering the scope
                        of this audit, the Board did not identify any issues of
                        non-compliance in relation to this requirement.

                        TransCanada outlines its goals, objectives and targets

                        Leadership Commitment and Strategy of the TOMs manual.
                        This section requires all mandated programs, including
                        emergency management, develop GOTs in line with the
                        overall corporate goals. For the EM Program, these GOTs
                        are documented in The Manual. This document lists the EM
                        Program goals as:

                        The audit found that goals for improving the

                        TransCanada has also established several metrics to

                        identification related to its EM Program. For example,
                        it tracks the percentage of EM Program related hazards
                        listed within the Risk Registries for which barriers and
                        mitigations have been implemented.

                        TransCanada demonstrated that it has developed GOTs

                        Keystone Pipeline System Emergency Response Plan) are
                        reviewed annually at a minimum. These manual reviews
                        incorporate input from stakeholders, and an assessment
                        of new hazards or risks introduced through related MOC
                        process.

                        the completed Document Modification Form, completed
                        2016/07/27 and closed 2016/10/21. These forms include
                        summaries of the impact assessments, proposed solutions

                      demonstrate how new (potential) hazards and risks are
                      introduced into EM manuals, contingency plans and

                        The Board verified through document review of the 2017
                        Training Matrix that the company has identified and
                        established specified training requirements for persons
                        expected to respond or support the response to an
                        incident. In addition, TransCanada has specified
                        detailed training requirements for persons with specific
                        EM responsibilities within the company. The IMT Master
                        Roster 2017, provided for Board review, lists all
                        32&nbsp;TransCanada personnel trained and identified as
                        Incident Commanders.

                      Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of
                      this audit, the Board did not identify any issues of
                      non-compliance in relation to this requirement.

                        of the TOMs manual. This element requires all mandated
                        programs including Emergency Management to follow the
                        TransCanada Document and Records Management practices
                        and policies. Changes to the Emergency Management

                        TransCanada's Document Change Management Procedure
                        defines the sequence through which changes to documents
                        are initiated, evaluated, approved, implemented and
                        followed up. In accordance with this procedure, all
                        Tier&nbsp;1 and Tier&nbsp;2 EM documents are reviewed
                        annually and include approval of the documents by the
                        appropriate authority. Tier&nbsp;3 documents do not
                        require approval or signoff, however, these documents
                        are also reviewed on a regular scheduled basis. Records

                        a Tier&nbsp;2 controlled document. As outlined within
                        the Plan, the EM Team is responsible for maintenance and
                        distribution of the Plan. The Plan resides as a

                        corporate and field staff access to make appropriate
                        revisions as required. At the time of the audit,
                        TransCanada demonstrated that its emergency management
                        manuals (Tier&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2) were being subjected to

                        Element&nbsp;2 of the TOMs manual (Risk Management)
                        outlines the foundations of risk management for the
                        protection programs. The EM Program abides by the Risk
                        Management Framework to ensure that identified risks are
                        being addressed in emergency response plans. The Board
                        verified through a review of the Manual, that each
                        region and facility is responsible for the
                        identification of hazards (both from internal and
                        external sources) which may result in an emergency
                        affecting TransCanada’s operations. &nbsp;The Manual
                        includes a list of hazards deemed applicable to company
                        operations categorized as asset based hazards, natural
                        hazards, or technology based hazards.&nbsp;

                        TransCanada also demonstrated that it has implemented
                        several activities to identify hazards at the program
                        level. These activities are performed by corporate
                        staff, business unit staff, subject matter experts

                        Program identify potential hazards or risks (as
                        appropriate), through the ongoing review of their own
                        Hazard Barrier Inventories and risk registers as

                        The Board noted that, although TransCanada demonstrated
                        that these activities were occurring, none of these
                        paths or streams are referenced in the management system
                        documentation.

                        “Although TransCanada conducts various hazard
                        identification activities through various mandatory
                        programs using multiple databases and collection media
                        (XL spreadsheets), the Board did not see an explicit,
                        integrated, coordinated and systematic process to
                        identify the hazards and potential hazards for the EM
                        Program.” In this case, the procedures and activities
                        are not formally linked together in documented overview
                        that would be considered explicit and systematic.
                        Further, the Board did not see an explicit, systematic
                        documented process describing how outputs of the hazard
                        identification various activities were integrated or
                        used in the development and maintenance of the EM
                        Program.

                      <p>
                        Hazard identification is a primary planning requirement
                        for the OPR management systems and a building block that
                        establishes the foundation of the management system.
                        During this audit, TransCanada did not provide
                        documentation to explain how outputs of the hazard
                        identification activities were integrated or used in the
                        development and maintenance of the EM Program.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Although TransCanada demonstrated that it has
                        established and linked hazard identification procedures
                        and activities throughout its EM Program, it did not
                        provide a documented overarching process that describes
                        how all of the hazard identification activities and
                        their resulting inputs and outputs are consistently
                        managed.
                      </p>
                      As a result of the assessment, the Board has determined
                      that TransCanada is in non-compliance with
                      OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(c). The Board requires that a CAPA
                      be developed to address this Non-Compliance.

                        TransCanada's Risk Registry incorporates the inventory
                        of identified hazards and potential hazards. In
                        addition, TransCanada has incorporated into a Risk
                        Management Process database which is used to categorize
                        hazards and apply mitigations when required.

                        the Board confirmed the inventory of hazards and
                        potential hazards correspond with the hazards listed in
                        The Manual. TransCanada also provided a demonstration
                        and records to confirm that new EM hazards were being
                        evaluated against the standing inventory within its

                        As outlined in the Risk Management Process, programs
                        including the EM Program should analyze the likelihood
                        of events related to risk sources, the potential
                        consequences of events, and then summarize the analysis
                        in a risk estimate, taking into account the
                        implementation and effectiveness of existing risk
                        controls. TransCanada’s IRAP consequence matrix is a
                        tool to be used to assess consequences in the seven
                        categories covered by the matrix. The IRAP matrix
                        includes both qualitative and quantitative consequence
                        descriptors and can be adapted to any type of analysis.

                        The Board verified through a review of TransCanada's
                        Risk Registry, that the registry provides a methodology
                        and a process to evaluate and manage risks associated
                        with the identified hazards, including the risks related
                        to normal and abnormal operating conditions. TransCanada
                        demonstrated that this methodology is applied to the EM
                        Program.

                        Response Plan (Tier&nbsp;2). Throughout these documents,
                        TransCanada refers to its reliance on the Incident
                        Command System (ICS) for managing the emergency
                        response.

                        During this audit, TransCanada pointed to the combined
                        actions and efforts of the ICS as its process used for
                        developing and implementing contingency plans for
                        abnormal events that may arise during emergency
                        situations. TransCanada also identified several
                        activities and practices it has implemented to manage
                        contingencies during emergencies in order to drive an
                        effective response to unforeseen or abnormal events
                        during an emergency. TransCanada discussed that during
                        emergency events, representatives from several areas of
                        the business such as Aviation, Lands, and Human
                        Resources are present, in person or via teleconference
                        in the Emergency Operations Centers, in order to address
                        issues arising from the event in a timely manner. Also,
                        as part of ICS, TransCanada has identified the
                        Operations Section Chief as the position responsible for
                        contingency planning during an emergency event; however,
                        TransCanada did not demonstrate that it has a process
                        for contingency planning.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Although TransCanada demonstrated that it has integrated
                        contingency planning activities throughout its response
                        procedures, it has not provided a documented process for
                        contingency planning that meets the requirements of the
                        OPR.

                        As a result of the assessment, the Board has determined
                        that TransCanada is in non-compliance with

                      <p>
                        For the purposes of this audit, the NEB verified that
                        TransCanada has emergency procedures that include the
                        safe control or shutdown of the Keystone pipeline system
                        or parts thereof in the event of an emergency. For its
                        Liquids Pipelines, TransCanada provided its Incident
                        Response and Isolation Plan and First Responder’s
                        Checklist for review. This document applies to all
                        pipelines controlled at TransCanada’s Oil Control
                        Center. It is designed to apply to various types of
                        emergencies including:
                      </p>
                      <ul class="lst-spcd">

                      <p>
                        Interviews confirmed that staff were aware of site
                        emergency and safety procedures as well as “first on
                        scene” documentation requirements. The audit verified
                        that operational and hazards related to abnormal
                        operation such as boat and equipment deployment were
                        identified and addressed within the procedures. Given
                        that the scope of the audit focused on the
                        identification and control of hazards, it should be
                        noted that, the adequacy and effectiveness of these
                        procedures was not included in the review.

                        The Board verified through a review of TransCanada's
                        documentation, and through interviews with TransCanada
                        personnel that the company regularly consults and
                        informs the public and agencies to be contacted during
                        an emergency, as appropriate (e.g., police and fire
                        departments) about the hazards associated with its
                        pipelines. This stakeholder engagement is largely
                        administered by TransCanada's Public Awareness Program.
                        The EM program includes consultation and training with
                        all agencies to be contacted or involved during an
                        emergency.

                        Through a review of TransCanada's documentation and
                        interviews with TransCanada personnel, it was determined
                        that the company regularly makes relevant sections of
                        the Emergency Response manuals or information therein
                        available to local authorities. These manuals and
                        information are provided in digital and/or hard copy,
                        through a controlled system, to ensure the information
                        is current.

                      <p>
                        At the time of the audit, the Board verified that
                        TransCanada is conducting various types of emergency
                        exercise drills to test and validate its EM Program and
                        procedures. In cases where external agencies are
                        involved in tabletops or full exercises, these agencies
                        provide feedback with debriefs.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Through interviews and record review, (Debriefing
                        &ndash; Portage La Prairie Drill Week September 2017)
                        the Board determined that TransCanada regularly assesses
                        its capability to respond to an emergency, in accordance
                        with its emergency procedures and response plans. The
                        company demonstrates and documents the effectiveness of
                        procedures and plans, through management reviews,
                        audits, exercises, drills and in the reviews following
                        actual emergency events.
                      </p>
                      Based on the review conducted and considering the scope of
                      this audit, the Board did not identify any issues of
                      non-compliance in relation to this requirement.

              <h3>NEB Purpose and Audit Framework</h3>
              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection
                of the environment, the Board has developed regulations
                requiring companies to establish and implement documented
                management systems applicable to specified technical management
                and protection programs. These management systems and programs
                must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the
                NEB Act and its associated regulations. The applicable
                Legislation and Regulations which come under the NEB’s mandate,
                responsibilities and powers include:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>National Energy Board Act and associated regulations;</li>
                <li>
                  Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act and associated regulations;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Canada Petroleum Resources Act (sections&nbsp;28 and&nbsp;35)
                  and associated regulations;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II, and the Canada
                  Occupational Health and Safety Regulations; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any conditions contained within applicable certificates or
                  orders issued by the Board.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks. The
                Board’s management system requirements are described within the
                NEB OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 through&nbsp;6.6.
              </p>
              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                The NEB expects pipeline companies to operate in a systematic,
                comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board
                expects companies to have effective, fully developed and
                implemented management systems and protection programs that
                provide for continual improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and
                maintain effective management systems and protection programs in
                order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions
                that may adversely affect the safety and security of the
                company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as
                the protection of property and the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, the NEB reviews documentation and samples
                records provided by the company in its demonstration of
                compliance and interviews corporate and regionally based staff.
                The NEB may also conduct separate but linked technical
                inspections of a representative sample of company facilities.
                This review enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy,
                effectiveness and implementation of the management system and
                programs. The NEB bases the scope and location of the
                inspections on the needs of the audit. The inspections follow
                the Board’s standard inspection processes and practices.
                Although they inform the audit, inspections are considered
                independent of the audit. If unsafe or non-compliant activities
                are identified during an inspection, they are actioned as set
                out by the Board’s standard inspection and enforcement
                practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines the
                Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations of the
                company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory
                requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the
                company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to
                address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports are
                published on the Board’s website. The audit results are
                integrated into NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to
                compliance assurance.

              <h3>Audit Objectives and Scope</h3>
              <p>
                This audit evaluated the company against the legal requirements
                and scope outlined in the main body of the audit report.
              </p>
              <h3>Audit Activities</h3>
              <p>
                On 2&nbsp;August 2017, the Board informed TransCanada of its
                intent to conduct this audit. Board staff then provided
                TransCanada with an overview of the NEB audit process, the audit
                criteria, a request for documentation and a list of questions to
                answer relevant to the objectives and scope of the audit. The
                NEB conducted its assessment based on the responses provided by
                the company and the evidence gathered during the audit. Board
                staff was in contact with company staff on a regular basis to
                arrange and coordinate this audit. TransCanada established a
                digital access portal for Board staff to review documentation
                and records.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 12&nbsp;September 2017, Board staff conducted an opening
                meeting with company representatives in Calgary to confirm the
                Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. Subsequent to the
                opening meeting, interviews were held at the company’s office in
                Calgary during the period&nbsp;12 to 27&nbsp;September 2017.
                Interviews were also conducted at the company's office in
                Hardisty, AB on 28&nbsp;September 2017. Throughout the audit,
                Board audit staff provided company representatives with daily
                summaries, including action items where required.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 17&nbsp;October 2017, the Board held an audit pre close-out
                meeting with company representatives. At this meeting, Board
                staff and TransCanada staff discussed potential non-compliances
                identified during the audit. At that time the company was
                provided with the opportunity to present additional evidence to
                rectify these potential non-compliances. Supplementary evidence
                was received from TransCanada on October&nbsp;23, 2017 and
                considered by the NEB.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 2&nbsp;November 2017, a close-out meeting was held to provide
                TransCanada with a description of the recommendations that staff
                would be bringing to the Board for decision.

                Appendix&nbsp;III&nbsp;: Terminology and Definitions
              </h2>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following definitions and
                explanations in measuring the various requirements included in
                this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or
                guidance and practices established by the Board, where
                available.)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the
                NEB&nbsp;Act, its associated regulations and referenced
                standards. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is
                demonstrated through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> The Company has demonstrated that it
                has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses
                the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains
                the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements
                of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained
                on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others
                working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the
                process or other requirement. Records and interviews have
                provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as
                prescribed (i.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;the process or procedures are not
                partially utilized).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Inventory:</strong> A documented compilation of required
                items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be
                integrated into the management system and management system
                processes without further definition or analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>List:</strong> A documented compilation of required
                items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be
                integrated into the management system and management system
                processes without further definition or analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)&nbsp;(o). With records, the company
                must demonstrate that it meets the records management
                requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(p).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in
                OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic
                approach designed to effectively manage hazards and reduce risk,
                and promote continual improvement. The system includes the
                organizational structures, resources, accountabilities,
                policies, processes and procedures required for the organization
                to meet its obligations related to safety, security and
                environmental protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to
                its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set
                out in OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in
                evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers
                more than the specific requirements of section&nbsp;6.1. It
                considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and
                implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its
                management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its
                organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6.4; and
                considers the establishment, implementation, development and/or
                maintenance of the processes, inventory and list described in
                section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1(c)
                and&nbsp;(d), the company’s management system and processes must
                apply and be applied to the programs described in
                section&nbsp;55.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> The Company has not demonstrated
                that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and
                procedures that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action
                plan must be developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order thereby allowing
                individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe
                manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities
                and authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process</strong>: A documented series of actions that
                take place in an established order and are directed toward a
                specific result. A process also outlines the roles,
                responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A
                process may contain a set of procedures, if required.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management system processes
                applicable to its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5(1) describes the Board’s required
                management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                developed or maintained as described within each section;
                whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                designed to address the requirements of the process, for example
                a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and
                potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required
                actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for
                staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The
                Board considers this to constitute a common 5 w’s and h approach
                (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that
                the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may
                therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as
                they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate
                any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR&nbsp;section.
                Processes must incorporate or contain linkage to procedures,
                where required to meet the process requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the processes constitute part of the management system, the
                required processes must be developed in a manner that allows
                them to function as part of the system. The required management
                system is described in OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.1. The processes
                must be designed in a manner that contributes to the company
                following its policies and goals established and required by
                section&nbsp;6.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each
                process must be part of the management system
                <strong>and</strong> the programs referred to in
                OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be compliant, the
                process must also be designed in a manner which considers the
                specific technical requirements associated with each program and
                is applied to and meets the process requirements within each
                program. The Board recognizes that a single process may not meet
                all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to
                establish governance processes as long as they meet the process
                requirements (as described above) and direct the program
                processes to be established and implemented in a consistent
                manner that allows for the management system to function as
                described in&nbsp;6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program
                outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in
                other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company
                regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the
                program is achieving the intended results.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB
                regulations.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The program must include details on the activities to be
                completed including: what, by whom, when, and how. The program
                must also include the resources required to complete the
                activities.

                    officers and employees at all levels. The company shall

                    The documented organizational structure shall also enable
                    the company to demonstrate that the human resources
                    allocated to establishing, implementing, and maintaining,
                    the management system are sufficient to meet the
                    requirements of the management system and to meet the
                    company’s obligations to design, construct, operate or
                    abandon its facilities to ensure the safety and security of
                    the public and the company’s employees, and the protection
                    of property and the environment. The company shall complete

                The Board has completed its Final Report for its audit of
                Enbridge’s Public Awareness Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Draft Report documenting the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s
                Public Awareness Program was provided to Enbridge on
                4&nbsp;February 2015 for review and comment. On 6&nbsp;March
                2015, Enbridge submitted its response.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has considered Enbridge’s comments and has made
                changes to the Final Audit Report and its Appendices as it
                determined to be appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of
                whether Enbridge was compliant with the regulatory requirements
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>

                <li>
                  Enbridge’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Enbridge was required to demonstrate the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the methods selected and employed within its
                Programs to meet the regulatory requirements listed above.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has enclosed the Final Audit Report and associated
                appendices with this letter. The Board will make the Final Audit
                Report public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the issuance of the Final Audit Report by
                the Board, Enbridge is required to file a Corrective Action Plan
                (CAP), which describes the methods and timing for addressing the
                Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for
                approval.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the CAP public and will continue to monitor
                and assess all of Enbridge’s corrective actions with respect to
                this audit until they are fully implemented. The Board will also
                continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                Enbridge’s Public Awareness Program and management system
                through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of
                its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and environmental protection.
                Pipeline companies under the Board&rsquo;s regulation are
                required to incorporate adequate, effective and implemented
                management systems into their day-to-day operations. These
                systems and associated technical management programs include the
                tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure NEB regulated
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. In the public
                interest, the Board holds companies accountable for safety and
                environmental outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board&rsquo;s comprehensive audit of
                Enbridge&rsquo;s Public Awareness program as it applies to its
                NEB-regulated subsidiaries and pipeline facilities. The audit
                was conducted based on the requirements contained within the
                <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Crossings Regulations</em>
                (PCR), <em>Canadian Standards Association Standard Z662-11</em>,
                <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em> (CSA&nbsp;Z662-11) as well
                as the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. The Board has
                incorporated these requirements within its audit protocol.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published audit
                protocol, which identifies five management system elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
                regulatory requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a
                company&rsquo;s program is found to be deficient with respect to
                any regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element will be found
                Non-Compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the companies it regulates must establish
                and implement documented management systems and apply them to
                the programs as described within the OPR as well as their
                Crossings and Public Awareness programs. The specific management
                system requirements are described within section&nbsp;6 of the
                OPR and within the referenced CSA&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Z662,
                <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em> in clause&nbsp;3.1
                <em>Safety and Loss Management System</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing the results of Enbridge&rsquo;s Public Awareness
                program audit the Board notes that Enbridge did not demonstrate
                it had developed and implemented a management system that
                directly applies to this program. The Board notes that the
                Public Awareness program management system requirements can be
                met by being directly subsumed within the programs referenced in
                the OPR or as part of a documented Safety and Loss Management
                System compliant with clause&nbsp;3.1 of CSA&nbsp;Z662
                <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em>. The Board did not see
                evidence that Enbridge had implemented either approach. Further,
                the Board notes that the requirements to have a documented,
                implemented and maintained Safety and Loss Management System are
                not new. The Board is of the view that this management system
                deficiency could have been prevented if Enbridge had ensured
                that appropriate compliance identification and monitoring
                processes had been established.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Public Awareness program is part of Enbridge&rsquo;s Land
                Services department. During the audit, Enbridge provided
                evidence that it was in the process of applying its corporate
                Integrated Management System to its Lands Services department.
                Enbridge demonstrated that some of the required processes had
                already been integrated into its program management activities;
                however, at the time of the audit, the Integrated Management
                System had not been fully documented, established or implemented
                for the Lands Services programs. Enbridge will need to develop
                and implement corrective actions to ensure establishment and
                implementation of a compliant management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to understand that the Board&rsquo;s finding
                regarding Enbridge&rsquo;s management system primarily reflects
                the company&rsquo;s stage in developing and applying its
                management system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of
                technical management activities being undertaken to ensure the
                safety of the pipeline. The Board found that, regardless of the
                lack of a compliant management system, Enbridge had developed
                and implemented a Public Awareness program that was addressing
                the majority and most significant of its hazards and the
                majority of its regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has made a significant number of Non-Compliant
                findings. The Board&rsquo;s analysis of these findings indicates
                that most of the non-compliances relate to the establishment and
                implementation of the management system processes and
                consequently its Safety and Loss Management System. All of the
                Board&rsquo;s findings are documented in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-wrnss/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of the Non-Compliant findings fall into two
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  lack of integration of its Public Awareness program into the
                  overall operational oversight management system processes: and
                </li>
                <li>
                  failure to implement management system sub-elements that are
                  consistent with the Board&rsquo;s expectations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Enbridge must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval. The Corrective Action
                Plan must detail how Enbridge intends to resolve non-compliances
                identified by this audit. The Board will assess the
                implementation of the corrective actions to confirm they are
                completed in a timely manner applied consistently across
                Enbridge&rsquo;s regulated system. The Board will also continue
                to monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of
                Enbridge&rsquo;s Management Systems through targeted compliance
                verification activities as a part of its ongoing regulatory
                mandate.

              <p>
                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board&rsquo;s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements, and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> Addresses the
                non-compliances identified in the audit report, and explains the
                methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the
                Board&rsquo;s regulatory requirements, this is primarily
                demonstrated by records of inspection, measurement, monitoring,
                investigation, quality assurance, audit and management review
                processes as outlined in the OPR
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of
                &ldquo;permanent basis&rdquo;, the Board requires the
                requirement to be implemented, meeting all of the prescribed
                requirements, for three months.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements
                of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> and its associated
                regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff have been
                trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff
                and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated
                use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews
                have provided evidence of full implementation of the
                requirement, as prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are
                not partially utilized).

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>o</em>). With records, the
                company must demonstrate that it meets the records management
                requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>p</em>).

                <strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR
                sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach
                designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote
                continual improvement. The system includes the organizational
                structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and
                procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations
                related to safety, security and environmental protection.

                  evaluating a company&rsquo;s management system, the Board
                  considers more than the specific requirements of
                  Section&nbsp;6.1. It considers how well the company has
                  developed, incorporated and implemented the policies and goals
                  on which it must base its management system as described in
                  section&nbsp;6.3; its organizational structure as described in
                  section&nbsp;6.4; and considers the establishment,
                  implementation, development and/or maintenance of the
                  processes, inventory and list described in
                  section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1(c)
                  and&nbsp;(d), the company&rsquo;s management system and
                  processes must apply and be applied to the programs described
                  in section&nbsp;55.</em

                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must
                be developed and implemented.

              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps

                individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe
                manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities

                  >OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) establishes the basic requirements
                  for management system processes. In evaluating a
                  company&rsquo;s management system processes, the Board
                  considers whether each process or requirement: has been
                  established, implemented, developed or maintained as described
                  within each section; whether the process is documented; and
                  whether the process is designed to address the requirements of
                  the process, for example a process for identifying and
                  analyzing all hazards and potential hazards. Processes must
                  contain explicit required actions including roles,
                  responsibilities and authorities for staff establishing,
                  managing and implementing the processes. The Board considers
                  this to constitute a common 5&nbsp;w&rsquo;s and h approach
                  (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes
                  that the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies
                  may therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as
                  long as they are designed to meet the legal requirements and
                  integrate any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR
                  section. Processes may incorporate or contain linkage to
                  procedures, where required to meet the process
                  requirements.</em

                  >As the processes constitute part of the management system,
                  the required processes must be developed in a manner that
                  allows them to function as part of the system. The system
                  requirements are described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The
                  processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the
                  company following its policies and goals established and

                  >Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each process
                  must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the
                  programs referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be
                  compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which
                  considers the specific technical requirements associated with
                  each program and is applied to and meets the process
                  requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that
                  single process may not meet all of the programs; in these
                  cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as
                  long as they meet the process requirements (as described
                  above) and direct the program processes to be established and

              <h2 id="s3">3.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
              <p>
                The NEB&rsquo;s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to ensure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures: the safety and security of the public and the
                company&rsquo;s employees; safety of the pipeline and property;
                and protection of the environment. To do this, the Board has
                developed regulations requiring companies to establish and
                implement documented management systems applicable to specified
                technical management and protection programs. These management
                systems and programs must take into consideration all applicable
                requirements of the NEB Act and its associated regulations, as
                well as the <em>Canada Labour Code Part&nbsp;II</em> (CLC).
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve compliance, regulated companies must demonstrate
                established, implemented, adequate and effective methods for
                identifying and managing hazards and risks. The Board reviews
                the documented compliance and incident history of the company.
                This review determines the appropriate scope for the audit.
                During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and some
                company records, and interviews of both corporate and
                regionally-based staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also conducts separate but linked technical
                inspections of a representative sample of the company&rsquo;s
                facilities to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness and
                implementation of the management system and programs. The Board
                bases the scope and location of the inspections on the needs of
                the audit. The inspections follow the Board&rsquo;s standard
                inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the
                audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If
                unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an
                inspection, they are actioned in accordance with the
                Board&rsquo;s standard inspection and enforcement processes to
                ensure ongoing safe operation
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines the
                Board&rsquo;s audit activities, provides an evaluation of the
                company&rsquo;s management system and programs identifies
                deficiencies and communicates compliance findings. The audit
                report follows the format of the Board&rsquo;s published Audit
                Protocol Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the
                company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to
                address all Non-Compliant findings for Board approval. Final
                Audit Reports are published on the Board&rsquo;s website. The
                audit results are integrated into NEB&rsquo;s risk-informed
                lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.

              <h2 id="s4">4.0 Background</h2>
              <p>
                Enbridge operates approximately 10,733&nbsp;km of pipeline in
                six Canadian provinces and territories. These pipeline
                facilities include pump stations, tankage and associated
                operational assets. All of these facilities are within the
                definition of a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; as included in the NEB
                Act. Enbridge also has a considerable amount of non-federally
                regulated infrastructure in Alberta and across the United
                States, which complete its North American system.
                Enbridge&rsquo;s system allows it to transport liquids from
                northern and western Canada to end-users in the Eastern regions
                of Canada and the United States. In order for Enbridge to
                operate its pipelines effectively, it has developed a management
                structure that reflects its safety and security management, and
                environmental obligations, as well as its corporate, national,
                regional and international needs. Enbridge Pipelines Inc.
                controls and uses several entities that hold NEB-issued
                certificates for operating in Canada. The entities included
                within the scope of this audit are identified in
                Section&nbsp;5.0, Audit Objectives and Scope of this report.
              </p>
              <p>
                During audit planning, company staff indicated that Enbridge and
                its subsidiaries operate the pipelines and facilities using a
                common management system and technical programs. In order to
                effectively evaluate compliance of such an expansive system
                within a reasonable timeframe, the Board chose to conduct
                individual, comprehensive audits of Enbridge&rsquo;s required
                technical programs and management system. This report documents
                one of six&nbsp;management system and program audits. The audits
                are titled:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Enbridge Integrity Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Safety Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Enbridge Environmental Protection Program Audit;</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Emergency Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Enbridge Third-Party Crossings Program Audit; and</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Public Awareness Program Audit.</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Audit results confirmed that Enbridge operates its facilities
                using an organizational structure to implement a common
                governance management system that applies to all of its business
                and operational activities. Some findings are therefore similar
                in each audit.

                The objective of the audit was to determine the adequacy and

                requirements against which Enbridge&rsquo;s was audited are

              <p>
                This audit was conducted using the National Energy Board Onshore
                Pipeline Regulations (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013.
                This amendment clarified the Board&rsquo;s expectations for
                establishing and implementing a documented management system
                applicable to specified programs. Public Awareness programs are
                not directly referenced within the OPR; however, the hazards
                addressed by Public Awareness programs are considered to be
                subsumed within the integrity, emergency, environmental and
                safety management programs. Before issuing the amendment, the
                Board consulted and communicated its regulated companies with
                respect to the new requirements; therefore, an implementation
                grace period was not given when the OPR was promulgated. As a
                result, when evaluating compliance, this audit did not consider
                any extra time Enbridge may have needed to implement changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. companies hold a number of
                certificates to operate in Canada. The Board has included the

              <p>
                Once Enbridge was identified through the annual compliance
                verification plan process as being due for a full system audit,
                the Board initiated its audit process. In undertaking this
                audit, the Board has applied its standard audit practice
                following its published protocols. The Board&rsquo;s standard
                practice and audit activities include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Formal notification of the Board&rsquo;s intent to audit by
                  letter;
                </li>
                <li>Interactive planning processes with the company;</li>
                <li>Information gathering;</li>
                <li>Documentation and record review;</li>
                <li>
                  Program presentations by company personnel and interviews with
                  company personnel;
                </li>
                <li>Associated inspections and facility reviews;</li>
                <li>Close-out discussions and meetings;</li>
                <li>Developing and Issuing Draft Audit Report to Enbridge;</li>
                <li>
                  Developing, finalizing and issuing the Final Audit Report;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reviewing and approving any required Corrective Action Plans;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reviewing implementation of Corrective Action Plans; and
                </li>
                <li>Issuing closure letters.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These audit activities allow the company to demonstrate whether
                its management system and programs comply. Audits also allow the
                Board to evaluate the company with respect to: assuring
                compliance to regulatory requirements; and assuring appropriate
                safety, security and environmental outcomes as described in the
                Board&rsquo;s expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. operates an expansive liquids
                pipeline system using a common management system and Public
                Awareness program. Furthermore, Enbridge divides its Canadian
                assets into five operational regions: Northern Region, Western
                Region, Central Region, Southern Prairie Region and Eastern
                Region. The Board therefore developed its audit plan to evaluate
                Enbridge&rsquo;s Public Awareness program and to assure that it
                was appropriately managed and applied to all of its regulated
                facilities regardless of location. To this end, the Board
                conducted interviews, inspections and documentation and record
                reviews in each region as well as the Edmonton office. The Board
                requires that any audit Non-Compliant findings made and
                corrective actions implemented as a result must be applied
                across all of Enbridge&rsquo;s Board regulated systems and
                subsidiaries.

                The Board informed Enbridge Pipelines Inc. of its intent to
                audit its NEB regulated facilities in a letter dated
                19&nbsp;December 2013. Following this letter, Board audit staff
                met with Enbridge staff on a regular basis to arrange and
                coordinate this audit. The Board also provided Enbridge with an
                information guidance document to help Enbridge prepare for the
                audit, and provide access to documentation and records to
                demonstrate its compliance. Enbridge established a digital
                access portal for Board staff to review documentation and

                On 59&nbsp;May 2014, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from Enbridge in Edmonton, Alberta to confirm
                the Board&rsquo;s audit objectives, scope and process. The
                opening meeting was followed by Edmonton office interviews from
                5 to 16&nbsp;May 2014, and various field level audit activities
                as described in the table below. Throughout the audit, Board
                audit staff gave Enbridge daily summaries with action items.

                On 21 and 22&nbsp;October 2014, the Board held an audit
                pre-close-out meeting with Enbridge. At this meeting Board staff
                and Enbridge staff discussed potential deficiencies identified
                during field activities and discussed additional information
                that could be of value to the Board prior to compiling its draft
                audit report. An audit close-out meeting was held on
                17&nbsp;December 2014 to provide Enbridge with a description of
                the recommendations that staff would be bringing to the Board
                for decision.

              <h2 id="s8">8.0 Management System Evaluation</h2>
              <p>
                The Public Awareness program activities are required to be
                formally managed within a documented and implemented management
                system. The Board notes that this program requires the
                development and implementation of a documented management system
                either directly subsumed within the management system and the
                applicable programs described in the OPR or as part of a
                documented Safety and Loss Management System required by
                clause&nbsp;3.1 of CSA&nbsp;Z662
                <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board&rsquo;s management system requirements are found in
                section&nbsp;6 of the OPR and within the referenced
                CSA&nbsp;Z662
                <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em> clause&nbsp;3.1
                <em>Safety and Loss Management System Management System</em>.
                The Board notes that Public Awareness program are not
                specifically referenced within section&nbsp;55 of the OPR and
                therefore are not subject to the same organizational
                requirements as other referenced programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, while Enbridge has demonstrated that it is
                in the process of applying its Integrated Management System to
                its Lands Services functions and has accounted for many of the
                processes described within the Board&rsquo;s protocol and the
                legal requirements, it did not demonstrate that it has developed
                and implemented a documented management system that meets the
                Board&rsquo;s requirements. Enbridge did not provide evidence of
                an organized structure that was specifically designed,
                implemented and managed to meet the regulatory requirements.
                Further, the Board notes that some of the key management system
                activities were not designed appropriately or being undertaken
                as required. As an example, Enbridge&rsquo;s auditing practices
                were not designed in a manner that would require a full
                management system or compliance audit to be undertaken.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found Enbridge to be Non-Compliant with its
                requirements to develop, implement and maintain a documented
                management system. Enbridge will need to develop and implement
                corrective actions to ensure establishment and implementation of
                a management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that it is important to understand that the
                Board&rsquo;s management system Non-Compliant finding reflects
                Enbridge&rsquo;s development and implementation of its
                management system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of
                technical management activities being undertaken to ensure the
                safety of the public, workers or the environment.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board&rsquo;s
                regulation are required to incorporate safety management
                programs into their day-to-day operations. These programs must
                include the tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure
                that workers are safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has established and implemented a
                Public Awareness program that provides external stakeholders
                with information regarding living and working around its
                facilities. As well, this program develops and distributes
                information related to emergency response to first responders
                and other stakeholders. Enbridge&rsquo;s Public Awareness
                program also:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  undertakes activities to reach its identified stakeholders;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  is positioned where it can best be leveraged within the Lands
                  and Emergency Departments.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, Enbridge was in the process of
                developing and implementing the integrated management system
                (IMS-19) which, if implemented, may address many of the
                deficiencies noted in this audit.

              <h2 id="s10">10.0 Summary of Audit Findings</h2>
              <p>
                The Board&rsquo;s audit was conducted following its Audit
                Protocol, which identifies five Management System elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are further broken down into
                17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each sub-element reflects a number of
                regulatory requirements. The NEB requires companies to be
                compliant with one hundred percent of the regulatory
                requirements of each of the Management System sub-elements being
                assessed. If a company&rsquo;s program is found to be deficient
                with respect to any regulatory requirement, the entire
                sub-element will be found in Non-Compliance. A Corrective Action
                Plan will be required in order to demonstrate to the Board that
                appropriate actions will be taken to achieve full compliance.

              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 - Leadership and Accountability</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must appoint an Accountable Officer and notify the Board
                of the appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge has submitted a written notice to the NEB indicating
                that it has appointed an Accountable Officer. In its submission,
                Enbridge confirmed that its Accountable Officer has authority
                over the human and financial resources required to meet the
                Board&rsquo;s substantive expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge has submitted a written notice to the NEB indicating
                that it has appointed an Accountable Officer. In its submission,
                Enbridge confirmed that its Accountable Officer has authority

                Board&rsquo;s substantive expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board&rsquo;s evaluation of Enbridge&rsquo;s Public
                Awareness program against the requirements, the Board has not
                found any issues of Non-Compliance. The Board has determined
                that Enbridge is Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 - Policy and Commitment Statements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have documented policies and goals to ensure the
                safety and security of the public, workers, and the pipeline and
                ensure protection of property and the environment. Further, as
                these policies and goals are to be used to establish and
                implement the management and programs, the Board requires that
                the policies and goals be explicit from the perspective of
                design, content and communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had corporate and program level
                policies and goals that related to its Public Awareness program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, notwithstanding the general policies
                developed, Enbridge did not demonstrate that it had a policy
                that explicitly describes internal reporting of hazards,
                potential hazards, incidents and near misses and describes the
                conditions under which a person making a report will be granted
                immunity from disciplinary action that meets the Board&rsquo;s
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board&rsquo;s evaluation of Enbridge&rsquo;s Public
                Awareness program against the requirements, the Board has
                determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
                Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to address the
                described deficiencies.

                and Control
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential
                hazards, assessing the degree of risk associated with the
                hazards, and implementing control measures to minimize or
                eliminate risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge demonstrated that it has
                established and implemented a Public Awareness program that
                incorporates the identification of hazards and introduces
                controls. While Enbridge demonstrated that it is in the process
                of establishing a risk register to serve as its hazard
                inventory, it was not able to demonstrate that has implemented a
                process to evaluate the risks that is consistent with Board
                expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board&rsquo;s evaluation of Enbridge&rsquo;s Public
                Awareness program against the requirements, the Board has
                determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
                Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to address the
                described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 - Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and monitoring compliance with all legal
                requirements applicable to the company. Also, the company must
                maintain a list of the legal requirements that apply to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge demonstrated that it was tracking,
                listing and communicating the majority of its legal
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge&rsquo;s methods to monitor
                its legal requirements and compliance to them did not meet the
                Board&rsquo;s requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge&rsquo;s legal list was not
                maintained as a single list, was incomplete and was not kept at
                the level of specificity required to enable the company to
                ensure and monitor its compliance with the legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed and implemented
                practices to communicate its legal requirements. The Board found

                Based on the Board&rsquo;s evaluation of Enbridge&rsquo;s Public
                Awareness program against the requirements, the Board has not
                found any issues of Non-Compliance. The Board has determined
                that Enbridge is Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;5.0 - Management Review</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;5.1 - Management Review</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element states that a company must establish and
                implement an effective process for conducting an annual
                management review of the management system and each protection
                program and for ensuring continual improvement in meeting the
                company&rsquo;s obligations. This sub-element also requires a
                company to complete an annual report for the previous calendar
                year, signed by the accountable officer, describing the
                performance of the company&rsquo;s management system in meeting
                its obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and implemented
                processes to address the stated requirements and had undertaken
                the activities associated with its processes. The Board also
                found, however, that Enbridge&rsquo;s processes did not fully
                meet all of the requirements. As a result, the management
                reviews completed by Enbridge were also found to be deficient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the Board found that some of the Non-Compliant
                findings made in this audit fall within the responsibility and
                accountability of Enbridge&rsquo;s senior management. These
                relate to direction, management and oversight and, as such, have
                contributed to the Non-compliant finding for this element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board&rsquo;s evaluation of Enbridge&rsquo;s Public
                Awareness program against the requirements, the Board has
                determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
                Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to address the
                described deficiencies.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive
                commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and
                environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the
                Board&rsquo;s regulation must establish and implement effective
                management systems in their day-to-day operations. This includes
                the tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure workers are
                safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has made a significant number of Non-Compliant
                findings. The Board&rsquo;s analysis of these findings indicates
                that most of the non-compliances relate to the establishment and
                implementation of the management system processes and
                consequently its Safety and Loss Management System. All of the
                Board&rsquo;s findings are documented in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-wrnss/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of the Non-Compliant findings fall into two
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  lack of integration of its Public Awareness program into the
                  overall operational oversight management system processes; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  failure to implement management system sub-elements that are
                  consistent with the Board&rsquo;s expectations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In reviewing the results of Enbridge&rsquo;s Public Awareness
                program audit the Board notes that Enbridge did not demonstrate
                it had developed and implemented a management system that
                directly applies to this program. Further, the Board notes that
                the requirements to have a documented, implemented and
                maintained management system are not new as the Safety and Loss
                Management System requirements have been included in
                CSA&nbsp;Z662 for a number of years and pre-date the OPR
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, regardless of the lack of a compliant
                management system, Enbridge had developed and implemented a
                Public Awareness program that was addressing the majority and
                most significant of its hazards and the majority of its
                regulatory requirements. The Board found that Enbridge has
                established and implemented a Public Awareness program that
                provides external stakeholders with information regarding living
                and working around its facilities. As well, this program
                develops and distributes information related to emergency
                response to first responders and other stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address these non-compliant findings.
                Upon receipt of the final report, Enbridge must develop a
                corrective action plan describing its proposed methods to
                resolve the non-compliances identified and the timeline in which
                corrective actions will be completed. Enbridge is required to
                submit its corrective action plan for Board approval within
                30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report being issued. The Board
                will make its final Audit Report and Enbridge&rsquo;s approved
                corrective action plan public on the Board&rsquo;s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of
                Enbridge&rsquo;s corrective actions to confirm they are
                completed in a timely manner and on a system wide basis until
                they are fully implemented. The Board will also continue to
                monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of
                Enbridge&rsquo;s Public Awareness program and management system
                as a whole through targeted compliance verification activities
                as a part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.

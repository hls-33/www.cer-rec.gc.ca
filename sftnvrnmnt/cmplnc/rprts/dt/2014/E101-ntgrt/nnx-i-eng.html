              <p>
                The Board requires the company to appoint an accountable
                officer. The accountable officer must be given appropriate
                authority over the company’s human and financial resources for
                ensuring that the company meets its obligations for safety,

                On 31&nbsp;March 2014, Enbridge submitted written notice to the
                Board indicating that its President, Guy Jarvis, had been
                appointed as the accountable officer for Enbridge Pipelines Inc.
                and all of its subsidiaries regulated by the Board. In its
                submission, Enbridge confirmed that it’s accountable officer has
                the authority over the human and financial resources required to
                meet the Board’s substantive expectations.

              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has not found any issues of Non-Compliance. The Board has
                determined that Enbridge is Compliant with this sub-element.

              <p>
                The company shall have documented policies and goals intended to
                ensure activities are conducted in a manner that ensures the
                safety and security of the public, workers, the pipeline, and
                protection of property and the environment. The company shall
                base its management system and protection programs on those
                policies and goals. The company shall include goals for the
                prevention of ruptures, liquids and gas releases, fatalities and
                injuries and for the response to incidents and emergency
                situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company shall have a policy for the internal reporting of

                will be granted immunity from disciplinary action.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company’s accountable officer shall prepare a policy
                statement that sets out the company’s commitment to these
                policies and goals and shall communicate that statement to the
                company’s employees.

              <p>
                The Board requires the company to document its policies and

                The NEB OPR does not include any specific management system
                process requirements for developing policies and goals. However,
                Enbridge has established clear management system guidance with
                respect to its process for developing policies and goals. At a
                governance level, Enbridge’s IMS-01,
                <em>Governance Documentation</em> outlines the company’s
                expectations for documenting key corporate policies, such as the
                <em>Strategic and Business Planning Processes</em>. The
                <em>Governance Documentation</em> also explains the company’s
                “Planning Cascade” and associated documentation. This Planning
                Cascade document explains how the company links its policies and
                corporate vision to its performance targets and metrics. The
                practices described within the
                <em>Governance Documentation</em> process align with the Board’s
                requirements for establishing policies, goals, objectives,
                targets and performance measures. While not an absolute
                alignment between the Board’s requirements and Enbridge’s
                internal processes it does reflect integration of the Board’s
                requirements into Enbridge’s business management practices.

                Enbridge’s IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.2.1,
                <em>Strategy and Objectives Development Process</em> describes
                the company’s process for establishing objectives, setting
                targets, and maintaining a dashboard of scorecard metrics. The
                executive management team uses the
                <em>Strategy and Objectives Development Process</em> to direct
                department priorities and activities. Section&nbsp;4.3.2,
                <em>Scorecard</em> and section&nbsp;4.3.4,
                <em>Dashboard Reporting Process</em> define the departmental
                processes for monitoring and measuring its performance against
                the Liquids Pipelines Business Plan and Enbridge targets.

              <p>
                With respect to the OPR requirements relating to developing “a
                policy statement that sets out the company’s commitment to these
                policies and goals and shall communicate that statement to the
                company’s employees”, the Board identified that Enbridge’s
                IMS-01 included a compliant statement signed by the company’s
                Accountable Officer. The Board noted that this statement had not
                been updated in the documents it received at the time of the
                audit. The Board notes, however, that the documents were
                provided to the Board before the company notified the Board of
                its new Accountable Officer. Therefore, the Board will not be
                making a Non- Compliant finding based on this lack of
                endorsement.

                At the department level, Enbridge’s IMS-09 section&nbsp;2.0,
                <em>Policy</em> is comprised of one sentence which states that
                <em
                  >“This management system is guided by the governing Policies
                  set out in IMS-01 (Section&nbsp;3) and is designed to anchor

              <p>
                Enbridge’s <em>Integrity Principles</em> describe the
                fundamental values in how it manages its Integrity Management
                program. Although implied by the <em>Integrity Principles</em>,
                Enbridge does not clearly state its goals for preventing
                ruptures, liquid and gas releases, fatalities and injuries. It
                also does not clearly state its goals for responding to
                incidents and emergency situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to OPR, section&nbsp;6.3(1)(<em>a</em>), this policy
                must also describe the conditions under which a person making a
                report will be granted immunity from disciplinary action.
                Enbridge policies indicate that persons will be granted immunity
                from disciplinary action, depending on the situation. However,
                the company’s policies do not make this explicit. Also, immunity
                from disciplinary action is not integrated into the policy for
                internal reporting of hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                near-misses as specifically required.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the governance level, IMS-01, section&nbsp;1.2.4,
                <em>Compliance Assurance</em> Enbridge states that
                <em

                This statement does not specifically say that members of its
                workforce will be granted immunity from disciplinary action when
                internally reporting hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                near-misses.

                IMS-02, section&nbsp;1.4.1,

                <em
                  >“Management will create a positive and frank atmosphere to
                  encourage timely reporting, discussion, and resolution of

                While this statement largely meets the requirements of
                6.3(1)(<em>a</em>), it does not guarantee all members of
                Enbridge’s workforce immunity from discipline at all levels of
                management within the organization.

              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has developed many policies,
                processes, principles, programs and to guide and support its
                Integrity Management program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found the following areas of non-compliance in
                the Policy and Commitment Statements sub-element:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Enbridge did not demonstrate that it has a policy that
                  explicitly describes internal reporting of hazards, potential
                  hazards, incidents and near-misses as required by OPR,
                  section&nbsp;6.3(1)(<em>a</em>);
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enbridge did not demonstrate that its policies include the
                  conditions under which a person who reports a hazard,
                  potential hazard, incident or near-miss will be granted
                  immunity from disciplinary action as required by OPR,
                  section&nbsp;6.3(1)(<em>a</em>); and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enbridge did not demonstrate that it has a management system
                  policy for its Integrity Management program that meets the
                  requirements of OPR, section&nbsp;6.3(1) and&nbsp;(2).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and the Integrity Management program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

                At a governance level, Enbridge’s IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.3,
                <em>Risk Management Process</em> describes the company’s process
                for identifying hazards, assessing risks and developing and
                implementing controls. The process includes written descriptions
                and the steps required for identifying hazards, assessing risks,
                planning risk responses, monitoring, reviewing and reporting
                risks. At a high level, the risk management steps identified in
                Enbridge’s Risk Management Process correspond to the legal
                requirements of this sub-element. However, in its review of this
                process, the Board noted deficiencies in the design and
                implementation of this process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s <em>Risk Management Process</em> outlines broad,
                inter-related requirements and commitments; however, it does not
                meet the Board’s process requirements as outlined in
                Section&nbsp;1.0 Audit Terminology and Definitions of the
                Board’s attached Audit Report.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Governance: Hazard vs Risk</em></h5>
              <p>
                In the governance <em>Risk Management Process</em> and related
                practices, Enbridge uses the terms “risk” and “hazard”
                interchangeably; this is inconsistent with the Canada Labour
                Code and the OPR and common practice definition or use of the
                terms. The Board has provided the following definition of hazard
                and risk in the past. Hazard: Source or situation with a
                potential for harm in terms of injury, ill health, damage to
                property, damage to workplace and environment, or a combination
                of these. Risk: Combination of the likelihood and consequence(s)
                of a specified hazardous event occurring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Board reviewed Enbridge’s program with this
                terminology issue in mind, the discrepancy has led to some gaps
                being identified in the overall Risk Management Process.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Governance Hazards Inventory</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s governance Risk Management Process requires that each
                sub-ordinate management system develop risk registers which is
                non-compliant with the requirements of OPR both in name and
                intent. The Board requires companies to develop an inventory of
                identified hazards and potential hazards.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Governance Risk Evaluation</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s governance Risk Management Process includes a risk
                evaluation practice within it. The Board reviewed Enbridge’s
                Risk Evaluation practice. The method used to evaluate the risk
                of hazards (Enbridge - risks) was fully developed and
                appropriate if it was implemented as designed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit also assessed the implementation of the risk
                evaluation process. This assessment determined that, while it
                was being implemented consistently across all of Enbridge’s
                programs, it was being utilized in a manner inconsistent with
                OPR requirements. Through interviews and document and record
                reviews, it was determined that Enbridge was implementing a
                practice whereby it applies the risk evaluation process to risks
                (hazards) taking into consideration the controls that may apply
                to the risk prior to the assessment. The result of this practice
                would be the identification of “residual” risk and assumes that
                the controls are directly applicable and appropriate to the
                hazard and that the control is being implemented fully on a
                consistent basis. The OPR process indicates that the risk
                evaluation should be applied directly to the hazard. This will
                determine “inherent” risk. This allows companies to fully
                identify the significance of the hazard and appropriately
                communicate, establish and implement controls and monitor it as
                required in the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                In evaluating the establishment and implementation of the
                Enbridge’s Risk Management Process, the Risk Management Process
                Map provided in IMS-01 section&nbsp;4.3, was noted to contain
                process steps that were colour-coded red and yellow. According
                to Enbridge, yellow colour coding indicates that the activities
                required to execute the process step are not adequately
                documented or not fully implemented in a consistent manner. Red
                colour coding indicates that the process step is aspirational
                and is not being executed by the organization. Several process
                steps within the Risk Management Process Map were colour coded
                red yet are regulated requirements within the overall Risk
                Management Process. For example, process step&nbsp;16 -
                “identify, assess and prioritize risks” is a process step that
                is required to meet the requirements of OPR
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>e</em>.). The Board has previously
                communicated that it recognizes aspirational practices as part
                of sound continual improvement practices. If a company clearly
                demonstrates that its practices are above the legal requirements
                and proactively communicates them as such within its overall
                programs, the Board will not find them non-compliant with OPR

              <p>
                The Board also reviewed Enbridge’s governance process for
                developing and implementing controls to prevent, manage and
                mitigate the identified hazards and risks. The Board found that
                Enbridge’s process did not meet the Board’s requirements with
                respect to the design of a process. As well, the Board was
                unable to see evidence of clear requirements and directions for
                considering and applying the hierarchy of controls when
                developing controls.

              <h5><em>Identification of Hazards and Potential Hazards</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that the processes for identification and
                analysis of hazards and potential hazards are established and
                implemented at the Departmental level.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Pipeline Hazards</em></h5>
              <p>
                At the departmental level, Enbridge’s Pipeline Integrity
                management system (IMS-09, Section&nbsp;4.5.2) includes
                programs, plans and procedures for identifying, analyzing, and
                managing hazards and potential hazards. Enbridge has developed
                programs for identifying most of the hazards prescribed in
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Annex&nbsp;H, Clause&nbsp;H2.6, and
                ASME&nbsp;B31.8S, and has identified specific hazards that are
                considered to be threats to the integrity of its system.
                Enbridge has also developed additional programs for identifying
                hazards that present specific threats to its pipeline such as:
                the pressure cycling program, inline inspection uncertainty
                reviews, and internal stress corrosion cracking (specific to
                Line&nbsp;21).
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing the documents and records provided by Enbridge, the
                Board did identify one issue with respect to Enbridge’s hazard
                identification program. The Board found that it has not included
                hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas as hazard or potential hazard.
                Although Enbridge provided background information challenging
                the requirements within CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Section&nbsp;16, the
                information does not provide adequate reasoning as to why H2S
                should not be considered a hazard or potential hazard. The Board
                notes that CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 requires a company to have a program
                to sample and analyze hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas in its crude.
                While Enbridge routinely monitors it’s crude for constituents to
                determine compliance with its General Terms and Conditions,
                including total sulfur content, Enbridge does not monitor for
                dissolved H2S. Although Enbridge’s pipeline system does not
                normally contain a gas phase, H2S gas may be present in
                Enbridge’s pipeline and facilities particularly during slack
                flow conditions, downstream of pressure reduction valves, and in
                dead-legs. In the absence of a program to sample and analyze H2S
                in its crude oil, or a documented engineering assessment, or
                ANSI/NACE&nbsp;MR0175/ISO&nbsp;15156-2, Annex&nbsp;C, to assess
                the hazard or potential hazard of H2S, Enbridge has not
                demonstrated that it complies with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;9.10.1.5, and CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;16.2.1(b).
              </p>
              <p>
                The corrective action plan developed with respect to this
                sub-element associated with H2S as a potential hazard must
                explicitly include any resultant changes to other management
                system processes and requirements that may be required. Examples
                of these changed include, but are not limited to, changes to
                Hazard and Risk Registers, lists of legal requirements and the
                hazard management processes.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Facility Hazards</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s procedure FI-01, Facilities Integrity Identification
                of Hazards and Threats outlines its processes identifying all
                hazards and potential hazards to its facility assets. The
                company assigns appropriate functional groups within its
                organization to address the hazards identified. The Facilities
                Integrity group develops programs for preventing, mitigating and
                inspecting time dependent damage mechanisms (hazards) in its
                tanks, piping and piping components that contain shipped
                products.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge also identifies hazards through right-of-way (ROW)
                monitoring, field operations, control centre operations, using
                inline inspection contractors, and the processes entailed in
                designing new construction and acquiring assets. Although these
                sources of hazard identification are not within Enbridge’s
                Integrity Management Program, they do support Enbridge’s hazard
                identification programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided during the audit, the Board
                did not identify any issues associated with this area.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Inventory of Hazards and Potential Hazards</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge Liquid Pipelines (LP), Pipeline Integrity and
                Facilities Integrity departments at Enbridge each maintain a
                list of hazards and potential hazards that pose a potential risk
                to the organization. These inventories of hazards and potential
                hazards are maintained within what Enbridge refers to as its IMP
                Hazard and Risk Registers. The IMP Hazard and Risk Registers
                identify hazards and potential hazards, potential consequences,
                controls, risk rating, planned actions, status of planned
                actions, action owners, and planned and actual completion dates
                for risks that require action. Enbridge’s Hazard and Risk
                Registers demonstrate that Enbridge has established and
                maintained an inventory of identified hazards and potential
                hazards, as required.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Evaluation of Risk</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board identified that, at the departmental level, Enbridge
                has developed specific IMS-09 requirements to address IMP risk
                management requirements. Enbridge indicated that its
                departmental processes are based on and linked with the Risk
                Management Process in IMS-01. Enbridge’s processes included
                analysis of information gathered in the risk identification
                stage to understand what the risks were and to evaluate any
                potential controls used to mitigate the risks to an acceptable
                level. The company practices incorporated the use of a risk
                matrix (Heat Map) to identify and categorize risks into four
                groupings. Enbridge presented evidence that demonstrated it had
                set its acceptable risk tolerance as Level&nbsp;II (Medium
                Risk). According to the information provided by Enbridge, risk
                response plans are required to be developed for Level&nbsp;III
                and Level&nbsp;IV risks to reduce the risks to acceptable levels
                (Level&nbsp;II or below). Further, Enbridge demonstrated it had
                developed and utilized a Risk Exposure Index (REI) to show the
                relative number of risks that exceed Enbridge’s established risk
                tolerance level. The REI allowed Enbridge to compare and manage
                risks departments. During the audit Enbridge demonstrated that
                it was updating its risk index models to move from primarily
                qualitative to more quantitative practices. Review of the
                information provided to demonstrate the improvements indicated
                that the (two) processes that observed to be in development are
                the Mainline Risk Assessment model and the Facilities Risk
                Model.

              </h5>
              <p>
                The Board was provided information indicating that, at a
                minimum, Enbridge monitors its risks quarterly and at the end of
                each year. Further documentation and record review indicated
                that process owners or project managers are responsible for
                monitoring risks within processes or projects and that the
                Enbridge Management Team monitored the risks documented within
                the Risk Registers to ensure that corrective actions and
                mitigation plans were being completed as scheduled. Further, it
                was noted that Enbridge’s Compliance department conducted
                quarterly and annual reviews on behalf of the executive
                management team to confirm that risks were being effectively
                mitigated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Documentation indicated that the Enbridge Liquids Pipelines Risk
                Management group is responsible for internal reporting of
                hazards and potential hazards through the annual Liquids
                Pipelines Risk Report, the Corporate Risk Assessment and the
                quarterly Operational Risk Management Report. These reports were
                supported by the data in the risk registers and the Risk
                Exposure Index. Enbridge posted this information on its
                intranet.

              <p>
                Enbridge’s process for internally reporting risks on an annual
                basis is outlined in IMS-01 and associated process documents.
                The Risk Management department compiles information and
                generates risk reports including the annual Liquid Pipelines
                Risk Report, the Corporate Risk Assessment and the quarterly
                Operational Risk Management report. Department risk registers
                track the proposed corrective and preventative actions. The Risk
                Management department is responsible for internal reporting of
                hazards and potential hazards at a governance level.

              <p>
                Hazards, potential hazards and threats identified through aerial
                and land-based ROW inspections are communicated immediately to
                Enbridge Operations personnel followed by daily reports to
                Enbridge Operations that summarize all hazards and threats.
                Employees can access these reports on a database.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a member of One-Call systems in each province, reports of
                hazards, potential hazards and threats (including potential
                third-party strikes) are provided to key Enbridge personnel for
                immediate action and mitigation. Hazards and potential hazards
                related to integrity are communicated to the Pipeline Integrity
                department and Field Operations. All leaks are reported through
                Enbridge’s online Leak Reporting System which is accessible by
                all employees. The Leak Reporting System automatically
                disseminates reports to key personnel.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Monitoring and Analyzing Trends</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge uses its data management system for monitoring and
                analyzing trends in hazards, incidents, and near-misses. The
                company monitors the failure mechanisms and failure rates for
                its mainline system on a per-km per-yr basis. Enbridge defines a
                failure as an undesired event that results in any loss of
                containment. Enbridge’s Event Learning Process which includes
                hazards, incidents and near-misses, documents and manages
                corrective and preventive actions. The Event Learning Process
                provides procedures for documenting and investigating events,
                developing and completing corrective action plans, and
                documenting learnings. Enbridge provides the records and
                resources that support the Event Learning Process to its
                employees on the Pipeline Integrity SharePoint site.
              </p>
              <p>
                To facilitate change in response to the analysis of trends in
                hazards, incidents, and near-misses, Enbridge’s Leak Reduction
                Team monitors and analyzes causes of systemic leaks, and makes
                recommendations for system-wide initiatives for reducing leaks
                on the Liquid Pipelines system. To capture a wide range of
                experience and knowledge, this team is comprised of personnel
                from several functional areas with roles in leak reduction.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Developing and Implementing Controls</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Pipeline Integrity department is responsible for
                identifying, assessing and managing threats to the pipeline
                system. By common integrity management practice, “threats” align
                with the Boards “hazards” requirements. IMS-09, section&nbsp;4.5
                describes the processes, activities and decisions for developing
                and implementing controls to prevent, manage and mitigate the
                identified threats/hazards and risks. Based on its interviews
                and documents review, the Board noted that these processes
                include practices and procedures for developing and implementing
                controls, as well as mitigation strategies for preventing,
                managing and mitigating hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that, although Enbridge did not demonstrate
                that it has a process to identify, assess and manage hazards
                (threats) to the pipeline system at a governance level, based on
                the information reviewed and interviews conducted, Enbridge has
                demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs at a
                Department level which meet the requirements of OPR
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>f</em>).
              </p>
              <h5><em>Communication of Controls</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge communicates its controls to prevent, manage and
                mitigate the identified hazards and risks through various means.
                Enbridge’s Risk Management department is responsible for the
                processes used to communicate controls to anyone expose to the
                risks. This department compiles Enbridge’s risks and information
                on the status of these risks in the annual Liquid Pipelines Risk
                Report, the Corporate Risk Assessment and the quarterly
                Operational Risk Management Report. The Operational Risk
                Management Plan communicates progress in managing or mitigating
                operational hazards and risks to senior management. Enbridge
                also communicates controls through signage, tailgate meetings,
                safety meetings, in its procedures and manuals and through
                safety bulletins. Further, Enbridge’s Hazard and Risk Registers
                provide a summary of controls implemented, and planned to be
                implemented, to manage and mitigate hazards and risks. These
                registers are communicated to Enbridge personnel via its
                intranet. An overall assessment of Enbridge’s compliance with
                the OPR management system communication process requirements is
                included in sub-element&nbsp;3.5.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at a program level, Enbridge had
                established practices and processes for identifying and managing
                the majority and most significant of its hazards and potential
                hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge did not demonstrate that it
                has established and implemented management system processes for
                identifying, analyzing and managing all hazards and potential
                hazards and associated risks that meet the Board’s requirements.
                Within its governance document IMS-01, Enbridge’s Risk
                Management Process focuses on managing risks for the company,
                however, the process does not identify and analyze hazards and
                potential hazards as required by OPR
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>c</em>.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the Board found that Enbridge did not demonstrate
                that it has included H2S as a potential hazard within its
                processes. In the absence of a program to sample and analyze H2S
                in its crude oil, or a documented engineering assessment, or
                ANSI/NACE&nbsp;MR0175/ISO&nbsp;15156-2, Annex&nbsp;C, to assess
                the hazard or potential hazard of H2S, Enbridge has not

              <h5><em>Governance: Identifying Legal Requirements</em></h5>
              <p>
                At a governance level, Enbridge’s IMS-01,
                <em>Governing Policy and Process Management System</em> and
                IMS-02,
                <em>Compliance and Ethics Management System</em> describe the
                company’s processes for identifying and monitoring its
                compliance with legal requirements. The IMS-02, Compliance and
                Ethics Management System, section&nbsp;4.5.1 indicates that the
                company is required to develop a master corporate compliance
                register and departmental compliance registers. The compliance
                registers link to the company’s verification processes, which
                are described in IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.4,
                <em>Health Checks</em> and IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.5,
                <em>Internal Reviews</em>. IMS-02, section&nbsp;5.2,
                <em>Performance Measurement and Management</em> describes the
                company’s governance processes for measuring and monitoring its
                compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The OPR requires a company to establish and implement a process
                to identify its legal requirements and establish and maintain a
                legal list of the identified requirements. IMS-02
                section&nbsp;4.5.1 outlines Enbridge’s processes for identifying
                its legal requirements and outlines requirements to develop
                master and departmental compliance registers. Review of this
                process indicated that it aligns with the OPR process
                requirements for identifying legal requirements and establishing
                and maintaining a legal list. Review of the process as
                documented identified that, by description it should lead to a
                compliant process. For example the process includes steps
                requiring monitoring of legal changes, updating compliance
                registers, etc. It also establishes roles and responsibilities.
                However, the Board’s audit of this process identified that it
                was limited to description of the requirements and did not meet
                the Board’s management system process requirements. Further, the
                process does not require the development of a single legal list.
                The process includes requirements to develop a master compliance
                register; however, this register specifically excludes certain
                requirements such as in orders and permits. These are to be
                tracked in individual departmental compliance registers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also reviewed the linked compliance verification
                processes that Enbridge indicated were used to monitor
                compliance. The Board’s review indicated that some of the
                processes are not designed to meet the Board’s requirements. For
                example, both the Health Check and Internal Review processes are
                specifically not expected to be comprehensive with respect to
                evaluating departmental or management functions or departmental
                or project performance. Additionally, as described in the
                Internal Audit sub-element&nbsp;4.3 below, the Internal Review
                process has not been established and implemented at the time of
                the audit and Health Checks are limited to reviewing the
                existing identified requirements that have been integrated
                within its existing processes and practices.

                At the governance level, Enbridge addresses its legal
                requirements in IMS-01 and IMS-02. IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.5,

                will be conducted every 12 to 18&nbsp;months using a

                <em>Internal Review Process</em> does not state that the
                internal review will be a zero-based assessment against the
                legal requirements, however, this process states that compliance
                deficiencies will be noted and tracked using an Event Report and
                that non-compliance with regulatory requirements typically
                constitutes an event.

                At the department level, the IMS-09
                <em>Compliance Register (Master)</em> has been developed to
                maintain a list of legal requirements that are applicable to the
                integrity management department in matters of safety, security
                and protection of the environment as required in OPR
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>h</em>). In a review of this document,
                the Board noted that the list of legal requirements was
                incomplete and did not address the level of specificity required
                to enable the company to monitor its compliance with the legal
                requirements. The
                <em>IMS-09 Compliance Register (Master)</em> did not include a

                Based on the review of Enbridge’s
                <em>IMS-09 Compliance Register (Master)</em> and applicable
                procedures, Enbridge did not demonstrate that it has established

                The Pipeline Integrity department is responsible for assessing
                compliance to current and pending regulations and maintaining a
                list of legal requirements for that department. The PI-83,
                <em>Pipeline Integrity Health Check</em> procedure applies to
                the Integrity Management System and related documents controlled
                and owned by the Pipeline Integrity department. Health Checks
                are to be completed regularly to measure the compliance,
                conformance and performance of Enbridge’s programs, and to
                identify improvement opportunities. The company defines
                compliance as adhering to laws, regulations and legal
                requirements in all jurisdictions where Enbridge operates, and
                adhering to Enbridge’s internal policies and procedures. PI-83
                references regulatory compliance requirements in the OPR;
                CSA&nbsp;Z662, <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em> (2011);

              <h5><em>Identifying and Resolving Non-Compliances</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge demonstrated that, subject to the
                limitations identified above, it had developed several processes
                and procedures designed to identify and resolve non-compliances
                as they relate to its identified legal requirements at the
                program.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed a number of
                governance and program level processes and practices for
                identifying and monitoring its legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge’s management system processes
                and requirements did not meet the OPR requirements. Enbridge did
                not provide its Master Compliance Register referred to in IMS-02
                for review by the Board during the audit and therefore did not
                demonstrate that it has established and maintained a list of
                legal requirements as required by the OPR. Further, at the
                department level, the
                <em>IMS-09 Compliance Register (Master)</em> list of legal
                requirements was incomplete and did not address the level of
                specificity required to enable the company to monitor its
                compliance with the legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                <em>Governance Documentation</em> also explains the company’s
                “Planning Cascade” and associated documentation. This Planning
                Cascade document explains how the company links its policies and

                Enbridge’s <em>Integrity Principles</em> described the company’s
                fundamental values with respect to how it manages its integrity
                management program. Further, The Liquids Pipelines Priorities in
                the annual Product Integrity <em>Department Plan</em> include a
                measurable end result and objectives to be achieved within a set
                timeframe. Priority&nbsp;(1) for Liquids Pipelines states that
                company intends to
                <em>“Eliminate ruptures and reduce leaks.”</em> This implies
                preventing ruptures, liquid and gas releases, fatalities and
                injuries. However, it does not explicitly state that the
                company’s goal is to prevent leaks, not just to reduce leaks.
                Based on the Board’s review of documentation provided,
                Enbridge’s did not demonstrate that it has a policy at the
                governance level that explicitly establishes goals for
                preventing ruptures, liquid and gas releases, fatalities and
                injuries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Enbridge did not demonstrate that it has explicit goals
                for the prevention of ruptures, liquid and gas releases,
                fatalities and injuries, and for the response to incidents and
                emergency situations, Enbridge does communicate its existing
                goals and priorities to its employees through a variety of means
                including presentations, emails, eLink advisories, documents,
                scorecards, and department plans.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has demonstrated an alignment
                between its governance processes and with the OPR requirements;
                the Board has not identified non-compliance with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, while Enbridge demonstrated that it
                had developed its <em>Integrity Principles</em>, and Enbridge’s
                Liquids Pipelines Priority&nbsp;(1) that both imply prevention
                of ruptures, liquid and gas releases, fatalities and injuries;
                neither establishes explicit goals for the prevention of
                ruptures, liquid and gas releases, fatalities and injuries as
                required by the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <h4>Expectations:</h4>
              <p>
                The company shall have a documented organizational structure
                that enables it to meet the requirements of its management
                system and its obligations to carry out activities in a manner
                that ensures the safety and security of the public, company
                employees and the pipeline, and protection of property and the
                environment. The documented structure shall enable the company
                to determine and communicate the roles, responsibilities and
                authority of the officers and employees at all levels. The
                company shall document contractors’ responsibilities in its
                construction and maintenance safety manuals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The documented organizational structure shall also enable the
                company to demonstrate that the human resources allocated to
                establishing, implementing and maintaining the management system
                are sufficient to meet the requirements of the management system
                and to meet the company’s obligations to design, construct,
                operate or abandon its facilities to ensure the safety and
                security of the public and the company’s employees, and the
                protection of property and the environment. The company shall
                complete an annual documented evaluation in order to demonstrate
                adequate human resourcing to meet these obligations.

              <p>
                At a governance level, Enbridge demonstrated that it has a
                single, over-arching management system process that describes
                the organizational structure and responsibilities for the
                ongoing development and implementation of its management system.
                The IMS documents defined the roles and responsibilities
                regarding occupational health and safety of all employees and
                contractors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The governance management system documents indicated that
                Enbridge’s executive management was responsible for upholding
                the management system policies, process, standards and
                requirements. They were also responsible for ensuring that
                appropriate resources are available to monitor compliance and
                implement continuous improvement of the management system.
                Further the documentation identified that Enbridge’s President’s
                responsibilities include allocating the resources necessary for
                management system compliance.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Governance Annual Evaluation of Resource Need</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge demonstrated that it has developed a number of
                corporately required or supported mechanisms for evaluating its
                resourcing needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge did not; however, provide specific documentation and
                records to demonstrate it evaluates the need for human resources
                allocated to establishing, implementing and maintaining its
                management system and explicitly meeting its OPR section&nbsp;6

                The Board identified that Enbridge’s Integrity Management
                Program is supported by approximately 250&nbsp;integrity
                personnel mostly based in Edmonton; 150 are Enbridge employees
                and 100 are provisional contractors. Enbridge has integrity
                specialists in each of its regional offices that liaise with the
                Pipeline Integrity team in Edmonton. These individuals are
                supported by field technicians, pipeline maintenance personnel
                and contracted specialists.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s integrity management organizational structure is
                documented in IMS-09, and supported by organizational charts for
                each region and supporting department or functional group.
                Enbridge documents the organizational structures of all of its
                business units and functional areas using an online tool called
                <em>OrgPlus</em>. These organizational structures align with the
                activities required to ensure the safety and security of the
                public, company employees and the pipeline, as well as the
                protection of property and the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Integrity Management program is executed through three
                functional groups: Pipeline Integrity, Operations and
                Engineering. The Pipeline Integrity department is part of
                Enbridge Pipelines Inc. - Liquids Pipelines. The Vice President
                of Pipeline Integrity leads the department and is supported by
                directors, senior managers, managers and a workforce. The Vice
                President of Pipeline Integrity reports to the Chief Operating
                Officer, who reports to the President - Liquids Pipelines and
                Major Projects. The Vice President of Pipeline Integrity is
                accountable for pipeline integrity management. The following
                three directors administer the programs: Director of Integrity
                Programs, Director of Integrity Systems and Director of
                Infrastructure Integrity. This organizational structure is
                documented in the Pipeline Integrity Functional Organization
                Chart dated 15&nbsp;March 2013.

                As components of the gathering system require integrity
                management approaches different from those used for the mainline
                pipeline system, Enbridge clarified these responsibilities in
                IMP-00-02-02, <em>Organizational Lines of Responsibility</em>.

                implemented within Enbridge’s integrity management department
                for establishing and communicating roles and responsibilities of
                company employees and workers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge hiring leaders work with Human Resources to develop job
                profiles for each position within the Integrity Management
                Program including positions that support normal and abnormal
                operations. Job profiles outline the roles and responsibilities
                of each position. Job ladders describe the work done at each
                level. Although these job ladders do not detail the specifics of
                positions; they do define the knowledge, skills and abilities
                required at each level on the job ladder.

                Enbridge links individual development plans and performance
                targets to its department plans, and to the overall business
                performance measured on the company’s scorecard and through
                initiatives tracking. Interviews with Enbridge personnel
                confirmed that the company is committed to ensuring that
                adequate and appropriate resources are in place to meet its
                obligations for designing, constructing, operating and
                abandoning its facilities to ensure the safety and security of
                the public and the company’s employees, and the protection of
                property and the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board requires the company to determine and communicate the
                roles, responsibilities and authority of its officers and
                employees at all levels within the company.
                <em>Department Plans</em> outline each department’s objectives,
                initiatives, performance targets and priorities for the upcoming
                year, and is communicated to all stakeholders to ensure support
                and understanding. The company also communicates roles and
                responsibilities through discussions and meetings with
                employees, on its SharePoint sites, by email, and on the
                company’s intranet.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board requires the company to document contractors’
                responsibilities in its construction and maintenance safety
                manuals. Enbridge defines two types of contractors: provisional
                contractors and contractors. Enbridge treats provisional
                contractors like employees and includes them in the company’s
                organizational structure. Provisional contractors must follow
                the same requirements as Enbridge employees. They include
                contract technical specialists that work within Enbridge
                departments alongside Enbridge employees. In contrast,
                contractors are personnel that typically provide a specified
                term of services or supply a product to Enbridge. Contractors
                are supported by specific written contracts that outline their
                responsibilities and the services or products they will provide.
                As stated in these written agreements, contractors work under
                the supervision of Enbridge personnel. Contractors acknowledge
                that they understand the terms and conditions to which they have
                committed, as documented on a work order or within a master
                service agreement.

              <p>
                Enbridge’s <em>Contractor Safety Manual</em> (January 2012)
                outlines the company’s rules, safe work practices and procedures
                for pipeline and facility construction and maintenance
                activities. Contractors work under the oversight of a company
                site inspector or operations representative. In contrast,
                provisioned contractors work under the direct supervision of an
                Enbridge employee and must follow the company’s operating and
                maintenance procedures. Workers hired for a set period of time
                under the direct supervision of a company operations
                representative must also follow Enbridge’s operating and
                maintenance procedures. The <em>Contractor Safety Manual</em> is
                part of the contract document. Enbridge gives the contractor
                copies of the manual before the contractor starts to work on any
                of the contracted activities. Documented in Enbridge’s
                <em>Operations and Maintenance Manual</em> (OMM), Book&nbsp;2:
                Safety 01-02-04, the Contractor Safety Management Program
                provides direction for managing contractor health and safety. It
                describes identifying hazards, implementing controls and
                preventing losses that arise from contractor work. The
                Contractor Safety Management Program applies to all contractors
                and contract personnel performing construction and maintenance
                work for Enbridge.

              <p>
                The Board found these mechanisms were being implemented within

              <p>
                The Board’s review of Enbridge’s processes and practices being
                used to evaluate its human resource needs identified that it did
                not specifically account for requirements related to staff
                outside of the department that have integrity management
                responsibilities, such as Field Operations and Maintenance
                staff.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                At the department level, the Integrity Management program
                organizational structure is documented in IMS-09 and supported
                by organizational charts for each region and supporting
                department or functional group. Based on the documents reviewed,
                the Board found that Enbridge’s organizational structure enables
                the company to meet the requirements of its management system
                and its obligations for carrying out activities in a way that
                ensures the safety and security of the public, company employees
                and the pipeline and protection of property and the environment.
                The Board found that has developed and implemented a number of
                corporately required or supported mechanisms for evaluating its
                resourcing needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge did not demonstrate that it
                explicitly evaluates the need for human resources allocated to
                establishing, implementing and maintaining its management system
                and meeting its OPR section&nbsp;6 obligations at a corporate or
                program level. Further, the Board found that Enbridge’s program
                level evaluation of need did not specifically account for
                integrity management program activities that were conducted by
                staff outside of the department that have Integrity Management
                responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                At a governance level, Enbridge’s IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.3,
                <em>Risk Management Process</em> describes the company’s process
                for developing and implementing controls for addressing its
                hazards and risks. As noted in sub-element&nbsp;2.1 of this
                audit, the Board found that this Enbridge process is
                non-compliant for several reasons, including the process design
                and implementation of the hierarchy of controls. Since the Board
                has already identified that Enbridge will have to develop
                corrective action plans for sub-element&nbsp;2.1, the Board will
                not assign additional non-compliances for the governance process
                in this sub-element; however, Enbridge must specifically
                consider and include any corrective actions associated with this
                sub-element within the corrective action developed plan
                developed for sub-element&nbsp;2.1.

                audit Enbridge indicated that these requirements were described

              <p>
                Review of the IMS processes indicated that they did not address
                the requirements identified in the sub-element directly and
                that, as noted elsewhere in this report the IMS-01&nbsp;4.14

                Review of the OMM processes indicated that they were not
                considered as governance management system process within the
                company. Enbridge is therefore non-compliant with respect to its
                OPR management system process requirements.

                At the governance level, Enbridge’s Liquids Pipelines Risk
                Management department focusses on quantifying (As stated in
                IMS-09 section&nbsp;4.5.2,
                <em
                  >“mitigation actions are carried out in consideration of high

              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge’s Integrity Management department
                was developing and implementing controls that address the
                hazards, threat and risks identified within its integrity
                management program. During the audit Enbridge identified that it
                has focused on quantifying the consequences of a loss of
                containment along the length of the pipeline and has developed a
                consequence profile for each segment of the mainline pipeline
                system. Enbridge also identified that its mitigation actions
                (controls) are carried out in consideration of high consequence
                areas such as waterways and populated areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                As assuring the control of pipeline and facility hazards is of
                primary importance to the Board, this audit included an in-depth
                examination of Enbridge’s Operational Controls. A description of
                the controls developed and implemented by Enbridge has been
                included in this sub-element. Unless otherwise noted, based on
                the information provided by Enbridge, no issues of
                non-compliance were noted during the Board’s audit of the
                controls.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the department level, Enbridge develops and implements
                controls for preventing, managing and mitigating the identified
                hazards through three types of programs: prevention, monitoring
                and mitigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company uses its IMS-09, section&nbsp;4.5.2,
                <em>Pipeline Integrity Threat Management Process</em> to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Identify potential integrity hazards or degradation mechanisms
                  that could lead to failure;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Characterize risks, and assess the consequences and likelihood
                  of occurrence of risk events; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Manage hazards in accordance with the company’s asset
                  management requirements through prevention, monitoring and
                  mitigation.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After identifying actual and potential threats and assessing
                their risks, the company develops prevention, mitigation and
                monitoring actions to control the threats. Enbridge documents
                the threats, risks, and planned actions to control threats in
                <em>Hazard and Risk Registers</em> for the Pipeline Integrity
                and Facilities Integrity departments, the annual Pipeline
                Integrity <em>Department Plan</em> and the Field Operations
                Department Plan. The company measures the status of the planned
                actions for controlling hazards and communicates the results as
                part of its improvement cycle. In addition to department plans
                and risk registers, Enbridge also uses its 2014
                <em>Liquids Pipelines Scorecard</em> to track and communicate
                the performance of the Liquids Pipelines business unit.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Threat Management</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge has designed and implemented a threat management
                process that includes activities, processes and procedures for
                ensuring the safety and integrity of pipelines and facilities.
                As part of this process, Enbridge manages control of identified
                threats through various methods of prevention, monitoring and
                mitigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge has developed processes, plans and procedures for
                managing the following threats to its pipeline system:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>fatigue and stress corrosion cracking;</li>
                <li>internal and external corrosion;</li>
                <li>coating degradation;</li>
                <li>welding defects;</li>
                <li>AC interference;</li>
                <li>geotechnical; and</li>
                <li>deformation and strain.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s Damage Prevention department, Operations group and
                Control Centre Operations manage other threats, such as
                third-party damage, improper operations and control system
                malfunctions.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Threat Mitigation Programs</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge has three primary methods in its Integrity Management
                program for mitigating threats: in-line inspections, pressure
                tests and direct assessments. The company relies primarily on
                in-line inspections to manage and monitor the hazards of
                internal corrosion, external corrosion, cracking, dents and
                mechanical damage. The company’s dig program is based primarily
                on the probability of failure. Based on Enbridge’s presentations
                and audit interviews, the Board found that the Integrity
                Management Program has applied a very conservative approach in
                its integrity programs to reduce the probability of failures to
                such a low level that the risks will remain low throughout the
                company’s pipeline system. The Board identified that Enbridge
                does not evaluate the consequences of failure when establishing
                dig schedules, but rather considers all possible consequences as
                “high” and focusses on reducing the probabilities to very low
                levels. The Board notes that Enbridge’s activities and
                conservative assumptions have been maintaining a very low
                probability of failures, which meets the company’s intention of
                achieving an acceptably low level of risk. This conservative
                approach is based on; less time between inline inspection
                re-assessments; reduced pressure cycling; and using very
                conservative crack growth rates and internal or external
                corrosion growth rates in deterministic modelling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge categorizes its threat control and risk reduction
                programs into the following five categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  surveillance and condition monitoring (measures to identify,
                  and reduce or eliminate risks and hazards at their source);
                </li>
                <li>mitigative measures;</li>
                <li>preventive measures;</li>
                <li>protective measures; and</li>
                <li>remedial measures.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5><em>Surveillance and Condition Monitoring</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge uses surveillance and condition monitoring to detect
                the presence of threats, monitor threat progression, and reduce
                or eliminate the threats or hazards at their source. Enbridge
                has developed various techniques and programs to monitor its
                system, verify pipeline and facility integrity, and confirm that
                prevention mechanisms are effective. Pipeline threat monitoring
                includes inline inspection, online pressure monitoring, pressure
                cycling monitoring, active slope monitoring, aerial and
                ground-based pipeline ROW monitoring, hydro-testing,
                non-destructive examination and direct assessment techniques.
                Threat monitoring for Enbridge’s facilities focusses on its;
                above-ground and below-ground station piping; above-ground
                storage tanks, laterals, small diameter piping, underground
                sumps, and flanges.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, to ensure that its monitoring programs are
                effective and that mitigations are being designed and
                implemented, a team (Leak Reduction Team) of subject matter
                experts from Pipeline Integrity, Operations and Engineering
                reviews all integrity related failures for each monitoring
                program.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Mitigative Measures to Address Risks and Hazards</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge applies mitigative measures and activities to reduce
                the likelihood of failures and minimize the consequences if a
                failure occurs. IMS-09, section&nbsp;4.5.5 provides an overview
                of the company’s mitigation process for managing potential
                pipeline threats and threats that have been identified through
                in-line inspections and other means. Enbridge’s mitigation
                measures include:
              </p>

              <h5><em>Preventive Measures to Address Risks and Hazards</em></h5>
              <p>
                As described in IMS-09, section&nbsp;1.7.2, preventing threats
                requires an integrated team approach that includes the Pipeline
                Integrity department, Operations and the Risk Management group.
                Preventive measures at Enbridge include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>selective pipeline routing;</li>
                <li>proper construction and material selection;</li>
                <li>limiting operating stress through design;</li>
                <li>quality pipeline installation; and</li>
                <li>
                  quality control programs during construction of tanks, piping
                  and associated equipment.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Preventive measures for Operations include applying cathodic
                protection and using chemical inhibitors to help prevent threats
                and manage defects identified through monitoring. These programs
                are primarily managed by Enbridge’s Field Operations and
                Maintenance department and are supported by technical expertise
                within the Pipeline Integrity department.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s damage prevention activities also include programs
                such as <em>Pipeline Depth Monitoring</em> and right-of-way
                (ROW) patrols to monitor threats that may pose a threat, risk or
                hazard. Other preventive measures include signage, line locating
                and One-Call systems, and communicating with landowners, the
                public, excavators and contractors to prevent third-party damage
              </p>
              <h5><em>Protective Measures to Address Risks and Hazards</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s protective measures to guard pipeline and facilities
                equipment against damage and failure are largely based on its
                coating integrity and cathodic protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge has a dedicated coating integrity program to address
                any coating of Enbridge’s steel assets. Protective coatings are
                used on almost all of Enbridge’s steel assets that are exposed
                to corrosive environments including immersion, buried service
                and atmospheric conditions. Enbridge records the type of
                coatings used on each of its pipelines on line summary documents
                and route sheets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge has also developed, implemented and documented a
                cathodic protection program to mitigate external corrosion on
                its pipelines and below-grade station piping. Routine monitoring
                and maintenance of its cathodic protection systems is completed
                as per the regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Remedial Measures</em></h5>
              <p>
                Remedial measures are activities completed to correct known
                issues, such as pipeline defects. Defects that do not meet
                Enbridge’s established acceptance levels are removed or repaired
                or otherwise mitigated through maintenance activities. Remedial
                activities include pipeline reinforcement, cut out, repair and
                temporary pressure reduction. They also include facility
                equipment repair, replacement or refurbishment. Pipeline
                Integrity works closely with Operations, Engineering project
                teams and other supporting departments to ensure remedial
                measures are completed according to plan and that resources are
                allocated appropriately.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s threat management process includes various programs
                for preventing, monitoring and mitigating threats to its
                pipeline system. The Board reviewed several key threat
                management programs as discussed below.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Crack Management Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge stated that the most common time-dependent cracking
                mechanisms experienced in its pipeline systems are fatigue
                cracking and stress corrosion cracking. Enbridge has developed a
                crack management program for addressing crack threats on its
                pipelines which applies to all liquid mainlines that fall within
                Pipeline Integrity’s responsibility. The
                <em>Crack Management Plan</em> is a continuous cycle that
                consists of assessing crack susceptibility, determining the
                reassessment interval and monitoring conditions.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Crack Susceptibility Assessment Process</em></h5>
              <p>
                This process applies to pipeline segments that have not had a
                susceptibility assessment or have experienced a change in
                probability during condition monitoring. Enbridge’s Crack
                Susceptibility Guideline provides guidance on determining
                susceptibility for fatigue cracking and stress corrosion
                cracking. Once susceptibility is determined, a mitigation plan
                is prepared. Enbridge’s
                <em>Crack Threat Assessment Guideline</em> provides guidance on
                choosing the best crack assessment method for a comprehensive
                assessment. Crack assessment methods include crack inline
                inspection, pressure tests and direct assessment.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Re-assessment Interval Process</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge uses this process to determine the intervals at which
                the crack susceptibility and crack threat of the relevant
                pipeline segment should be re-assessed. This process applies to
                all pipeline segments within Pipeline Integrity’s
                responsibility. Procedure PI-41,
                <em>Crack Inline Inspection Interval Determination</em> outlines
                the company’s process for determining re-assessment intervals.
                Section&nbsp;4.1, <em>Susceptibility</em>, describes the factors
                that affect failure susceptibly for fatigue cracking and stress
                corrosion cracking; however, Section&nbsp;4.1 fails to address
                corrosion fatigue. The Board noted that corrosion fatigue is
                also not addressed in Enbridge’s
                <em>Crack Susceptibility Guideline</em> document.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Crack Inline Inspections</em></h5>
              <p>
                According to Enbridge’s documentation, crack inline inspection
                is the most common crack threat assessment method used by
                Enbridge. Inline inspection is considered the most informative
                form of crack threat assessment because it provides detailed
                information about axial cracks and crack-like features. At the
                time of the audit, the only NEB regulated mainline pipeline that
                was not piggable and had not had a crack inline inspection was
                Line&nbsp;24.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Corrosion Fatigue</em></h5>
              <p>
                As part of its audit, the Board specifically examined Enbridge’s
                crack management program for information with respect to how
                Enbridge manages the threat of corrosion fatigue.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result of the Board’s Integrity Management Program audit of
                Enbridge in 2008, Enbridge committed to applying its learnings
                from the 2007 Glenavon failure to its corrosion fatigue model.
                Enbridge committed to develop and implement a method that
                includes local corrosion wall loss as well as crack depth when
                performing engineering assessments of crack defects occurring in
                areas of corrosion. Enbridge also committed to develop and
                implement a corrosion fatigue model for pipelines under cyclic
                loading that estimates growth rates for cracks occurring in
                areas of corrosion to be used when determining re-inspection
                intervals.
              </p>
              <p>
                In light of the 2010 failure in the United States referred to as
                the “Marshall, Michigan rupture and release”, corrosion fatigue
                was considered a critical component of Enbridge’s crack
                management program. The National Transportation Safety Board, in
                its PB2012-916501 report dated June 2012, determined that
                <em
                  >&quot;the probable cause of the pipeline rupture was
                  corrosion fatigue cracks that grew and coalesced from crack
                  and cor</em
                >osion wall loss in addition to the crack depth when performing
                engineering assessments of crack defects coincident
                <em
                  >rosion defects under dis-bonded polyethylene tape
                  coating...”</em
                >. In response to the 2010 Marshall failure, Enbridge submitted
                its newly developed and implemented crack management program for
                corrosion fatigue to its US regulators to address the
                recommendations made by the NTSB. Enbridge was required to
                develop and implement a methodology that included local corrwith
                areas of corrosion. As well, it was to develop and implement a
                corrosion fatigue model for pipelines under cyclic loading that
                estimates growth rates for cracks that coincide with areas of
                corrosion when determining re-inspection intervals. Enbridge
                stated that it had addressed the recommendations by modifying
                its Integrity Management Program and Crack Management Program.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Direct Assessment</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge uses this threat assessment method on pipelines for
                which the target threat is stress corrosion cracking. Direct
                assessment involves gathering and analyzing dig results from
                sites likely to have stress corrosion cracking. During audit
                interviews, Enbridge stated that it has developed its own
                procedures for direct assessments based on Inline Inspection
                data. NEB inspections of Enbridge’s dig sites carried out in
                support of this audit confirmed that the direct assessment
                methodology used by Enbridge was adequate.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC)</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s OMM, Book&nbsp;3: 05-03-02,
                <em>Evaluating Stress Corrosion Cracking Clusters</em> documents
                this method of assessing SCC. With this method, clusters of
                crack-like indications are evaluated to determine whether the
                clusters have significant stress corrosion cracking. Enbridge’s
                assessment method for SCC, as determined during NEB inspections,
                was considered to be adequate.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Threat Management of New Construction</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board saw evidence that subject matter leads from Enbridge’s
                Corrosion Programs department within Pipeline Integrity
                participate in new construction activities. These staff members
                help develop hydro-test plans, identify the need for chemical
                inhibitors, and are responsible for the cathodic protection
                design standards applicable to new construction. Once the
                pipeline is transitioned to the Pipeline Integrity department,
                an internal corrosion control program is developed and
                implemented for each new pipeline to prevent and control
                internal corrosion threats. No issues were identified during the
                review of this practice.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Geohazard Management Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, Enbridge’s geohazard management
                program was in development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board was advised that the procedures for slope management,
                river crossing management, longitudinal stress management, the
                Inertial Monitoring Unit, longitudinal strain evaluation and
                seismic load management are under development. Enbridge
                currently monitors slopes and water crossings using ROW patrols
                conducted every two weeks and ground inspections conducted on
                intervals based on the threat at each site. The geohazard
                management program manages approximately 500&nbsp;slopes and
                700&nbsp;watercourse crossings for NEB regulated pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s current geohazard management program addresses most
                geotechnical hazards and the associated monitoring and
                mitigation requirements. However, the Board identified that
                Enbridge does not, currently have a formal program for managing
                the threat of seismic activity. At the time of the audit,
                Enbridge was developing a program for managing the threat of
                seismic activity. As the program was still in development at the
                time of the audit, Enbridge did not demonstrate that the program
                meets the requirements included in this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Mechanical Damage Management Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s Mechanical Damage Management Program (MDMP)
                integrates the company’s geometry Inline Inspections (ILI) with
                its corrosion program Inline Inspections. During the audit
                presentations, interviews and responses to follow-up information
                requests, Enbridge’s MDMP team provided documents and records to
                verify that high resolution geometry inline inspection tools
                have been run in all of Enbridge’s NEB regulated pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Mechanical Damage Management Program is supported by
                Pipeline Integrity (PI) procedures that address ILI mechanical
                damage data review and assessment, data trending and integration
                and developing and executing a dig program to investigate ILI
                features related to mechanical damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The auditors did not identify any issues with the current state
                of how the MDMP s addresses the hazards due to mechanical
                damage, as well as the monitoring and mitigation requirements
                from a technical standpoint. Enbridge’s MDMP corresponds to the
                current industry practices and available technical
                methodologies. However, in terms of management system
                requirements, Enbridge’s Pipeline Integrity Management System
                document (IMS-09), Section&nbsp;4.5.5 Mitigate Pipeline Threats
                Process Overview, and specifically Figure&nbsp;4.5.5-1 the
                Process Overview Map, does not contain a documented process step
                for the MDMP.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit presentations and interviews, Enbridge MDMP
                subject matter experts indicated that the MDMP had yet to be
                integrated into the IMS-09 process requirements. While the MDMP,
                from a program level technical practice standpoint, does address
                the hazards related to mechanical damage, the Board determined
                that the MDMP cannot be assessed as compliant because of its
                current state of formal incorporation into the Pipeline
                Integrity Management System process.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Inline Inspections Data Integration </em></h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge gave a presentation outlining its
                Inline Inspections Data Integration tool that it uses to
                identify where possible multiple anomalies identified by ILI,
                may be located in the pipelines. Since each inline inspection
                tool is not able to detect every feature type, Enbridge
                integrates inline inspections data to identify the following
                interacting threats:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>corrosion + crack;</li>
                <li>deformation + corrosion;</li>
                <li>deformation + crack; and</li>
                <li>deformation + crack + corrosion.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Enbridge has completed a data integration assessment associated
                with the above on all of its NEB regulated pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge excavated 87 features based on its threat integration
                analysis for Lines 01, 03, 05 and 11. The results demonstrated
                that primary and secondary features were found to be interacting
                in the field 52% of the time. This indicates that almost half of
                the digs completed may have not been required, which supports
                the conservative approach Enbridge has been taking for
                identifying and addressing possible anomalies. Enbridge
                continues to work with inline inspections vendors to improve its
                detection and characterization of anomalies.

                As noted above, during the audit Enbridge indicated that it has
                established a number of OMM and program based processes that
                address the Board’s requirements for coordinating, controlling
                and managing the operational activities of employees and other
                people working with or on behalf of the company. The Board’s
                review of the referenced documents and associated records
                provided by Enbridge indicated that, at the integrity management
                program level, the company has established appropriate practices
                and processes.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has developed and implemented a
                significant number of programs, processes and practices to
                prevent, manage and mitigate most of its hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found non-compliances related to Enbridge’s
                hazard mitigation programs and controls.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the governance level, Enbridge
                references IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.3
                <em>Risk Management Process</em> and the Risk Management Process
                Map. Step&nbsp;#17 -

                on this process map is colour coded red, indicating that the
                processes are either aspirational or are not fully established
                or implemented and therefore are non-compliant with the OPR.
                This non-compliance has been previously identified as part of
                the Board’s finding documented in sub-element&nbsp;2.1
                <em>Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control</em>,
                above. The corrective actions developed to address that finding
                must specifically must specifically consider and include any
                corrective actions associated with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge did not provide information with
                sufficient clarity for the Board to evaluate Enbridge’s controls
                to address the threat of corrosion fatigue as part of its crack
                management program. Enbridge will need to provide this
                information in a manner that facilitates the Board’s evaluation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge’s Geohazard Management Program did
                address most of its geotechnical hazards; however, the program
                and the associated controls were not fully developed and
                implemented and therefore presently non-compliant. Additionally,
                the Board found that Enbridge’s GeoHazard Management Program had
                not fully integrated and addressed all of the requirements for
                managing the threat of seismic activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge’s Mechanical Damage Management
                Program did address most of the identified hazards due to
                mechanical damage; however, because of its current state of
                development and implementation, the Board assessed Enbridge’s
                mechanical damage management program as non-compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the program level, Enbridge has
                developed and implemented processes and practices for
                coordinating, controlling and managing the operational
                activities of employees and other people working with or on
                behalf of the company; however, the Board also found that
                Enbridge has not established and implemented management system
                level processes that meet the OPR requirements relating to these
                same issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and the Integrity Management program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

                Enbridge uses the processes described in sub-elements&nbsp;2.1

                releases, incidents and emergency situations. Therefore, the
                general findings of those sub-elements apply to this sub-element
                as well. Since any issues applicable to this sub-element must be
                addressed in the corrective action plan developed for

              <p>
                The Board requires the company to establish and implement an

                events that may occur during construction, operation,
                maintenance, abandonment or emergency situations. It is
                important to note that contingency plans are not limited to
                emergency response. The Board found that Enbridge’s governance
                processes did not include specific processes or policies for
                developing contingency plans for abnormal events.

                As assuring the control of pipeline and facility hazards is of
                primary importance to the Board, this audit included an in-depth
                examination of Enbridge’s Operational Controls. A description of
                the controls developed and implemented by Enbridge has been
                included in this sub-element. Unless otherwise noted, based on
                the information provided by Enbridge, no issues of
                non-compliance were noted during the Board’s audit of the
                controls.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Pressure Control and Over-pressure Protection</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge presented information on its
                <em>Pipeline Integrity - Protocol</em>, 3.2, that any pressure
                above 100% of the allowable working pressure is deemed an
                overpressure, and that Control Centre Operations contacts
                Pipeline Integrity if an overpressure exceeds 110% of the
                maximum allowable operating pressure. Enbridge previously
                advised the Board that it does not have mechanical overpressure
                protections on its pipeline as required in CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;4.18.1.2 The Board therefore issued a Safety Order
                in May 2013 (SO-E101-004-2013) that required Enbridge to submit,
                for Board approval, its plan for conducting a transient analysis
                and assessment on all Enbridge pipelines and facilities. The
                Safety Order also required Enbridge to provide a timeline and
                explain the prioritization of its transient analysis mitigation
                plan. Further, Enbridge was required to provide a status update
                every six&nbsp;months on the progress of its overpressure
                control and overpressure protection mitigation. The last
                progress meeting with Enbridge and NEB staff concluded that
                Enbridge was proceeding with changes to its operating procedures
                and PSV settings, installing pressure relief systems and
                imposing flow restrictions when required.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the Board has oversight on the issue of overpressure control
                and overpressure protection through its Safety Order and
                subsequent follow-up, overpressure control and overpressure
                protection have been excluded from the scope of the Integrity
                Management Program audit.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                Based on interviews, and document and record reviews, the Board
                found that Enbridge has established controls for managing and
                mitigating abnormal operating conditions that have been
                identified in its integrity management program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge does not have a management
                system process for developing contingency plans that meets the
                requirements of the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and the Integrity Management program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <h5><em>Governance Management of Change Process</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge identified that it had developed a
                governance management of change process. In reviewing the
                documents and records and conducting interviews, the Board found
                that Enbridge’s governance process had not been fully
                established or implemented at the time of the Board’s audit. The
                Board’s review found that Enbridge’s design of its governance
                process does not meet the OPR management system process
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge indicated that MOC processes and
                requirements are embedded in all of its existing written
                processes, procedures and practices. Enbridge indicated that a
                single MOC process would not be able to meet its or other
                companies with significant facilities and processes,
                requirements. Therefore, Enbridge has multiple processes
                embedded in multiple locations. Further, Enbridge indicated that
                its interpretation of the OPR is to “ensure that a MOC process
                is available for unplanned, unexpected or infrequent changes
                that are not already embedded in existing activities and
                processes. There is no requirement in the OPR for these various
                management of change processes to be formally tied to one
                another.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Enbridge’s interpretation and practices
                are inconsistent with the Board’s interpretation of the OPR
                process requirements. The Board notes that the OPR requires a
                company to develop a management system MOC process that
                identifies and manages <strong><em>any</em></strong> change that
                could affect safety, security or the protection of the
                environment, not only those described by Enbridge. Further the
                Board notes that, while a company may have multiple processes,
                there still must be consistency in process requirements,
                development and implementation as well as coordination of the
                various practices in order to meet the OPR requirements and to
                ensure formal management. The Board notes that a singular
                management system process developed to meet the OPR
                requirements, as prescribed, would address these requirements.

                At the department level, IMS-09, section&nbsp;4.2
                <em>Management of Change</em> referenced Enbridge’s IMS-01
                governance process. The Board identified that Enbridge had
                developed and implemented its PI-82,
                <em>Pipeline Integrity Management of Change procedure</em>.
                PI-82 outlines the roles and responsibilities, processes and
                procedures for ensuring that all changes are planned
                appropriately to eliminate and/or reduce risks and are completed
                safely. As per the documentation provided for review, PI-82
                <em
                  >“applies to all changes initiated or led by the Pipeline
                  Integrity department including changes to process, design,
                  specifications, standards, procedures, operations and
                  personnel. It applies to all assets where change is managed
                  through Pipeline Integrity; and covers permanent, temporary
                  and emergency changes.”</em
                >
                Further it was demonstrated that PI-82 also addressed changes
                that are initiated by other Enbridge departments that may affect
                pipeline integrity, and that the changes are communicated as
                required by the Liquids Pipelines (LP) MOC process. Enbridge
                also demonstrated that Pipeline Integrity MOC records are filed
                and stored formally. The Board’s review of the Liquids Pipelines
                (LP) MOC process indicated that it has not been incorporated
                within the existing IMS process.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge demonstrated that it had
                established and implemented a number of MOC procedures and
                practices to document and manage change at the program level on
                a consistent basis. The Board identified that all departments
                and programs were using Enbridge’s Liquids Pipelines MOC
                process, including Integrity Management, as its primary
                corporate MOC process. The Board, however, identified that this
                process did not meet all of the MOC process requirements and was
                specifically not intended to be included within its IMS process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge did not demonstrate that it
                had established and implemented a management system level
                process that meets the requirements of the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              </h5>
              <p>
                Through interviews and document and record review, the Board
                found that Enbridge has established and implemented a
                documented, comprehensive training program applicable to its
                employees undertaking integrity management activities. The
                training program is appropriately supported and managed
                throughout the organization. Enbridge has developed a management
                system called the Enbridge Learning Management System (eLMS).
                eLMS provides the mechanism to register, deliver, track and
                record learning completions. Enbridge’s Human Resources
                department provides support to all departments for the
                development of departmental content and eLearning programs and
                each department manages the content of programs housed in eLMS.
                The Board verified that Enbridge has implemented the systems to
                generate, manage and document the various training programs
                through front line interviews and inspections.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding Enbridge’s training program implementation, the
                Board found that Enbridge had not established and implemented
                compliant, documented processes for developing competency
                requirements that are used to develop training and learning
                programs and to establish baseline competencies required for
                employees and others working on behalf of the company to perform
                assigned tasks in a manner that is safe, ensures the security of
                the pipeline and protects the environment. Similarly, the Board
                found that Enbridge has not established and implemented a
                process for verifying competency as required. Interviews with
                staff indicated that there were undocumented competency
                evaluation processes being undertaken at the time of the audit;
                however, they did not meet the Board’s management system process
                requirements. Record reviews conducted by the Board indicated
                that Enbridge had at one time implemented a formal Competency
                Based Training program but that had been officially discontinued
                a number of years ago. It was identified that staff in some of
                the regions were still implementing the practices of this
                program as a method to ensure competency of new staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board considers competency identification and verification
                to be a key component in assuring the safety of workers, the
                public, the environment and facilities. Therefore, this issue
                was brought to Enbridge’s attention as requiring urgent
                attention. Enbridge has responded by developing an interim
                process while Enbridge’s Workforce Competency and Qualification
                Process (WCQP), commenced in 2013, is being fully rolled out.
                This was provided to the Board for review prior to end of its
                close-out discussions. While not yet demonstrated as established
                or implemented, based on initial interviews with departmental
                staff, the Board found that the described practices could meet
                the Board’s requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s review of the written governance policy that had
                been provided by Enbridge indicated that some of the key legally
                required process requirements were mapped as “red”. According to
                Enbridge’s described process mapping convention this would
                indicate that the process steps are “aspirational” and therefore
                outside of its legal requirements to be measured by the Board.
                As noted elsewhere in this report, aspirational or stretch
                practices are encouraged but they cannot include legally
                required content within this category.

                as a systematic approach to ensure that training and
                qualifications align with industry best practice and result in a

              <p>
                Enbridge’s Pipeline
                <em>Integrity Training and Qualifications Program</em> outlines
                Enbridge’s processes for developing training and competency
                requirements to
                <em

                >
                This program includes descriptions of the roles and
                responsibilities required to ensure effective implementation and
                are supported by several sub-programs to ensure personnel have
                access to and receive the necessary training.
              </p>
              <p>
                Training and qualifications of provisional contractors are
                reviewed by Enbridge People Leaders on a case-by-case basis.
                Provisional contractors are provided job descriptions and
                expectations within their contracts. Training and qualifications
                requirements for non-provisioned contractors, consultants and
                vendors are outlined in the Supply Chain Management System.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Effectiveness of Training</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s procedure to review the effectiveness of its training
                programs is described in OMM, Book&nbsp;1,
                <em
                  >General Compliance Reference - Procedure and Training
                  Effectiveness</em
                >. Pipeline Integrity reviews its training and qualifications
                program annually as part of its management system review to
                ensure that the program is fit-for-purpose and is delivering the
                desired results. The company reviewed its training and
                qualifications program in 2013 and documented all of the
                resulting improvement requirements in the 2014 Continuous
                Improvement Plan and department initiatives. Enbridge
                demonstrated that it is maintaining a process for reviewing the
                effectiveness of its training and qualifications program, and
                ensuring that proposed improvements are being implemented.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Qualifications and Supervision of Contractors</em></h5>
              <p>
                OMM, Book&nbsp;2,
                <em>Safety - Contractor Safety Management Program</em> applies
                to all contractors and contract personnel that perform
                construction or maintenance work at Enbridge facilities
                including the pipeline ROW. Contractors must meet the
                requirements of the contractor safety prequalification process
                before they begin to work for Enbridge. Once a contract is
                awarded, Enbridge operations personnel supervise the contractor
                throughout execution of the work. Interviews with Enbridge
                regional personnel and field personnel verified that contractors
                do not complete work for Enbridge without an Enbridge employee
                or representative in attendance. Enbridge refers to contractor
                evaluations to ensure that contractors are trained and competent
                to complete the work awarded to them. Enbridge has also
                implemented a process to ensure that contractors receive a level
                of supervision that helps ensure that the work is completed in a
                manner that is safe, ensures the security of the pipeline and
                protects the environment. Based on the records reviewed, the
                Board found that Enbridge’s processes for verifying that
                contractors are adequately trained and supervised has been
                established and implemented.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Competence</em></h5>
              <p>
                The
                <em
                  >Training, Competence and Assessment - Field Operations
                  Training Services</em
                >
                document summarizes the current state of Enbridge’s program for
                assessing employee competence. According to this document,
                competency assessment is completed through a layered approach
                that consists of mandatory training, procedures, field level
                mentorship/supervision, and health and safety programs. An
                experienced employee within the same discipline mentors new
                hires. The duration of the mentorship is at the discretion of
                field leadership and depends on the new hires’ pace of
                development. Enbridge only permits new hires to perform safety
                critical tasks independently after the employee’s direct leader
                has deemed the person competent to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mentorship program used in the South Prairie Region
                (Estevan) and in the Central Region (Regina) includes
                documentation that states that, once mentored staff demonstrate
                proficiency, the mentor must complete a sign-off document. The
                Board did not receive records that demonstrated that Enbridge
                had been consistently completing this formal sign-off. Audit
                interviews indicated that the sign-off is presently an informal
                process. Enbridge does, however, have a process for supervising
                workers to ensure that they perform their duties in a manner
                that is safe, ensures the security of the pipeline and protects
                the environment. Enbridge personnel stated that, by practice,
                new hires typically work with a mentor for at least
                one&nbsp;year before being allowed to undertake tasks
                independently. The new hires are advised verbally that they have
                been assessed as competent to do the tasks safely and according
                to prescribed procedures.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Awareness of Responsibilities</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board requires the company to have an established,
                implemented and effective process for making employees and other
                persons working with or on behalf of the company aware of their
                responsibilities in the processes and procedures required by the
                management system and the company’s protection programs. In a
                review of programs and procedures Enbridge uses to communicate
                the responsibilities of employees and other persons working on
                behalf of the company, Enbridge demonstrated that it met the
                requirements of OPR Section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>l</em>).

                <em>Generating and Managing Training Documents and Records</em>
              </h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s process for generating and managing training
                documents and records is largely based on the following:
              </p>
              <ul>

                <li>Monthly Training Report for Pipeline Integrity.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In reviewing the records, Enbridge demonstrated that it had an
                established, implemented and effective process for generating
                training documents and records.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and implemented a
                formal management program for identifying and managing its
                training requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge had started to implement a
                new process for the identification and verification of worker
                competency. However, this new process remains non-compliant as
                it has not been established or implemented and that its
                governance management system process does not meet the Board’s
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                The Board found that Enbridge’s governance level management
                system processes are inadequate. Enbridge’s IMS-01 is limited to
                requiring Enbridge’s IMS-01 is limited to requiring that each

              <h5><em>Integrity Management Program Communication</em></h5>
              <p>
                At the Program level, the Board assessed Enbridge’s
                communication processes specific to the Pipeline Integrity
                Management Program. IMS-09 Section&nbsp;4.4
                <em>Communication, Participation and Engagement</em> provided an
                overview of several programs and methods being used by this
                department in communicating pipeline integrity related
                information. At the department level, Enbridge did not
                demonstrate that it has a formal, documented communication plan
                that supports the effective implementation and operation of the
                safety and loss management system as per CSA&nbsp;Z662-11
                clause&nbsp;3.1.2(d) and as required by Enbridge’s governance
                management system commitments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of the state of Enbridge’s management system process,
                the Board found that Enbridge conducts a significant amount of
                internal and external communication using a number of corporate
                and departmental practices. During audit interviews, Enbridge
                personnel stated that the communication processes by which they
                received information about safety, security and environmental
                protection were effective. The Board found that Enbridge’s
                personnel demonstrated a good understanding of integrity
                management information and were knowledgeable in accessing
                information through the various communication methods that
                supported the staff comments.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge communicated throughout its
                organization as a matter of practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge had not established or
                implemented a communication process that meets the Board’s
                management system process requirements, the requirements
                outlined in CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 clause&nbsp;3.1.2(d) and as
                required by its internal commitments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                This sub-element includes the requirements to develop a process
                for identifying the documents required for the company to meet
                its obligations described in OPR section&nbsp;6.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the information provided to the Board, Enbridge indicated
                that its interpretation of the OPR requirements is that the
                required documents to meet its obligation are “those documents
                developed as part of the management system required by the OPR”.
                Enbridge further identified that its management system design is
                comprehensive and encompasses the all of the company’s
                activities that are designed to meet the obligations. As such it
                indicated that its IMS - 01 section&nbsp;1.3
                <em>Integrated Management Structure</em> identifies the
                documents required. The Board’s review of this section indicated
                that it did not constitute a list of documents or
                classes/categories of required documents. It was a high level
                description of the nineteen management systems that comprise
                Enbridge’s management system and high level descriptions of the
                content of each.

              <h5><em>Governance Documentation and Document Control</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge was not able to demonstrate that it
                had established or implemented a governance management system
                process that meets the Board’s Documentation and Document
                Control process requirements. Enbridge did not provide a
                documented management system process until after the Board’s
                closeout discussions. This document was dated 22&nbsp;August
                2014; however, until provided by Enbridge, the Board was not
                presented evidence of its existence either as a document or as
                referred to by Enbridge staff during interviews. The Board could
                not therefore verify its establishment or implementation during
                the audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s review of this document indicated that it did not
                meet the OPR management system process requirements as described
                elsewhere in this audit report. As well the Board could not
                determine the applicability of the process to the programs
                required in OPR section&nbsp;55 as the process as written only
                appears to apply to the governance management system processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of the Enbridge’s lack of compliant management system
                processes, the Board found that Enbridge does have some document
                control processes that it is presently using on a corporate
                basis. Enbridge governs its document processes through its
                <em>Documents Policy</em>, which is available on the company’s
                intranet and through an online tool called the Governance
                Documents Library. The Board identified that the Documents
                Policy and its associated practices and tools set Enbridge’s
                minimum standards for documents and document tracking.

                Review of these lists identified that they constituted lists of
                documents to be formally managed within the program; however,
                they did not include management system processes that meet the
                OPR requirements for identification of documents required to
                meet its obligations under OPR section&nbsp;6.

                documents. The process must include obtaining approval of
                documents by the appropriate authority. Further, the company
                must document these processes and procedures. In reviewing
                Enbridge’s integrity management program document management
                processes, the Board found that Enbridge has demonstrated that
                it has developed and implemented processes that meet the OPR
                requirements at a program level.

                process for identifying and managing any document changes. In
                reviewing Enbridge’s integrity management program document
                management processes, the Board found that Enbridge has
                demonstrated that it has developed and implemented document
                change practices that meet the OPR requirements at a program
                level.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the program level, Enbridge
                demonstrated that it had developed document control lists and
                procedures and practices for managing and controlling its
                integrity management program documents that address many of the
                OPR requirements.

                The Board also found that, at the governance level, Enbridge
                provided its new IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.9
                <em>Governance Document Control Process</em>, dated
                22&nbsp;August 2014; however, Enbridge did not demonstrate that
                this process met the OPR requirements or had been established

                management system inspection, measurement and monitoring
                practices in its IMS-01 manuals. The IMS documents describe
                Enbridge’s process for Health Checks, internal reviews, audits

                requirements with respect to design and management. The Board
                has included its program requirements with Section&nbsp;1.0
                <em>Audit Terminology and Definitions</em> in the attached audit
                report.

              <h5><em>Governance Corrective and Preventative Actions</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge indicated that its IMS,
                section&nbsp;4.6,
                <em>Corrective and Preventive Action Management Process</em>
                defines the minimum standards for administering, tracking and
                managing corrective and preventive actions through their
                implementation and resolution. This process applies to Enbridge
                departments and addresses events, hazards and near-misses. This
                process includes Health Checks, internal reviews, regulatory
                inspections, investigation and audits. The documentation
                provided at the time of the audit does not show that Enbridge’s
                <em>Corrective and Preventative Action Management Process</em>
                has been fully implemented. Portions of the process, according
                to the process map, have only been partially implemented at the
                IMS level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the requirement to have a process to take
                corrective and preventive action is included in many of the
                sub-elements within the Board’s audit protocol and the OPR. The
                Board therefore requires the corrective action plan developed to
                address the deficiencies identified for this sub-element to
                explicitly include all sub-element and OPR requirements, where
                corrective and preventive actions are referenced.

              <p>
                As assuring the control of pipeline and facility hazards is of
                primary importance to the Board, this audit included an in-depth
                examination of Enbridge’s inspection, measurement and monitoring
                processes. A description of the processes and practices
                developed and implemented by Enbridge has been included in this
                sub-element. Unless otherwise noted, based on the information
                provided by Enbridge, no issues of non-compliance were noted
                during the Board’s audit of Enbridge’s processes and practices.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Evaluating Adequacy and Effectiveness</em></h5>
              <p>
                As part of its demonstration of compliance Enbridge directed the
                Board to its IMS-09, section&nbsp;5.2,
                <em>Performance Measurement Management</em>. This section
                stated,
                <em
                  >“Pipeline Integrity performance measures are evaluated with
                  respect to their effectiveness within the Management System
                  and associated integrity management processes and programs.
                  Performance measures are also evaluated against existing and
                  proposed regulatory requirements.”</em
                >
                In its review of Enbridge’s documentation and records, the Board
                found that it had established metrics for evaluating the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its protection programs, as per
                the statements. These were listed in IMS-09, Appendix&nbsp;7.1
                and included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Number of leaks or Ruptures - on the mainline or at
                  facilities;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inline inspection program - planned runs versus completed
                  runs;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remediation program - km of pipe replaced, % of digs completed
                  within deadlines; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inspection of high-risk facilities - planned inspections
                  versus completed inspections.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5><em>Surveillance and Condition Monitoring</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board identified that Enbridge has implemented surveillance
                and condition monitoring activities to detect the presence of
                threats, monitor threat progression and reduce or eliminate the
                threats or hazards at their source. Enbridge uses various
                techniques to monitor its system, verify pipeline and facility
                integrity and confirm that the company’s prevention mechanisms
                are effective. Many of these have been discussed and assessed in
                Section&nbsp;3.1:
                <em>Operational Control - Normal Operations</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Techniques that Enbridge uses to monitor its system and to
                confirm that its prevention mechanisms are effective include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>pipeline ROW surveys;</li>
                <li>corrosion control surveys (cathodic protection);</li>
                <li>external corrosion monitoring;</li>
                <li>
                  internal corrosion monitoring and chemical injection program;
                </li>
                <li>inline inspections management process;</li>
                <li>hydro-test management process;</li>
                <li>geotechnical surveys and water crossing surveys; and</li>
                <li>mechanical damage management programs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Enbridge also has developed several programs to support
                Facilities Integrity Management. These include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>facility (on-property) piping program;</li>
                <li>laterals (off-property) piping program;</li>
                <li>flange integrity program;</li>
                <li>pressure vessel integrity program;</li>
                <li>replacement and monitoring of sump tanks;</li>
                <li>above-ground storage tank integrity program; and</li>
                <li>ancillary small diameter piping program.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5><em>ROW Aerial Inspections</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge stated that it relies almost exclusively on its aerial
                inspections for surveillance and monitoring of its pipeline
                ROWs. Enbridge patrols its pipeline system on a regular basis
                using fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. With the exception of
                ROW aerial inspections of Enbridge’s gathering system in
                Saskatchewan, all pilots completing the ROW aerial inspections
                are Enbridge employees. Enbridge’s South Prairie Regioncontracts
                its ROW inspections to a company in Saskatchewan that patrols
                the gathering system on behalf of Enbridge. CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1 uses the term “periodically” and the
                OPR-99, section&nbsp;39 remains silent on the patrol frequency.
                The Board found that Enbridge’s ROW patrol frequencies are in
                compliance with the intent of the standard and regulation for
                pipeline patrol frequency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board reviewed Enbridge’s procedures and reports for aerial
                ROW patrols. The Board found that Enbridge’s procedures include
                the requirement for observing conditions and activities set out
                in CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1; however, the
                company’s monthly patrol reports do not include verifying that
                each required condition and activity was surveyed or assessed
                during the flights. As such, Enbridge did not demonstrate that
                its aerial surveillance programs fully comply with the
                requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1 and the
                OPR.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <em>Monitoring of Corrosion and Chemical Injection Program</em>
              </h5>
              <p>
                In its audit the Board identified that Enbridge samples its
                products periodically to ensure they meet the specifications for
                products transported in its pipeline system. The company
                completes a chemical analysis on the samples to determine
                sulphur content, water content, product density and the presence
                of contaminants. Enbridge has installed corrosion monitoring
                coupons in 40 of its incoming pipelines at terminals and remote
                terminals through its pipeline system to monitor the
                effectiveness of the chemical programs put into place to manage
                internal corrosion. Enbridge analyzes coupons twice a year for
                average metal loss that may be attributed to corrosion, pitting,
                and/or erosion. The company also analyzes product samples to
                determine the adequacy of its chemical injection program by
                measuring the residual inhibitor.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Cathodic Protection Monitoring</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge monitors its cathodic protection programs through
                annual corrosion control surveys, which are primarily completed
                by contracted companies. Enbridge uses information from the
                annual cathodic protection reports for each region to compile
                its Pipeline Integrity cathodic protection line summary. The
                line summary assists Pipeline Integrity threat managers in
                establishing re-assessment intervals for inline inspections.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em
                  >Note: Enbridge’s regulated facilities include, by necessity a
                  significant number of “non-pipeline” facilities that require
                  individualized integrity management and monitoring practices
                  and activities based on technical requirements. As part of its
                  audit, the Board reviewed these requirements separately during
                  its integrity management program in order to ensure that an
                  appropriate audit was conducted. The Board included it
                  assessment within this sub-element as it best aligned with the
                  required outcomes. The Board, however, expects that, in the
                  developing any management system process corrective actions
                  arising from this audit, these facilities will be explicitly
                  considered, where appropriate.</em

              <h5><em>Facilities Integrity Program Overview</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Enbridge Facilities Integrity department was formed in 2005
                to address releases from tankage, equipment and piping in
                Enbridge’s stations and terminals. In 2011, the Pipeline
                Integrity department integrated the Facilities Integrity group
                within its organization. The purpose of this change was to
                ensure that all pipelines and facilities assets have access to
                all of Enbridge’s integrity subject matter experts, and to allow
                for an integrated approach between the pipeline and facility
                integrity management systems. Enbridge developed its Facilities
                Integrity management system to be in alignment with its Pipeline
                Integrity management system.

                IMS-01, <em>Governing Policies and Processes</em>,
                Section&nbsp;1.2, The Foundations of Integrated Management,
                outlines the 16 process sets required to achieve safety
                management and operational reliability. Number 12 is the process
                for System and Facilities Integrity. In this process, Enbridge
                describes its structured approach for assessing the integrity of
                its pipeline and facility assets through monitoring, inspection
                and evaluation programs.

                While IMS-09 is the overarching document for Pipeline Integrity
                and Facility Integrity, Enbridge uses a tiered approach for its
                Facilities Integrity Program processes and procedures. Documents
                such as the
                <em>Facilities Integrity Management Program Framework</em> and
                the

                >
                fall under the umbrella of IMS-09. These guidance documents are
                supported by Tier&nbsp;2 processes and procedures, which are
                labelled with an FI number. Enbridge’s FI documents provide
                details on the purpose, scope, responsibilities and procedures.
                Tier&nbsp;3 procedures are taken from the OMM and provide
                detailed procedures for operations personnel to follow when
                conducting site-specific tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                As discussed previously in this section, Enbridge has developed
                several programs to support Facilities Integrity Management.

              <h5><em>Station Piping Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge has developed and implemented a Facilities Integrity
                Management Program for its above-ground and underground station
                piping. Enbridge's station piping program addresses corrosion in
                above-ground and below-ground facility piping. According to
                Enbridge's Facility Integrity 2014
                <em>Path to Zero Incidents</em> document, station piping
                accounted for approximately 7% of the releases in Enbridge
                facilities over the past 11&nbsp;years. Enbridge’s station
                piping program currently focuses on internal corrosion issues in
                piping sections of idle piping, dead-leg piping, low flow and/or
                intermittent flow, and low points in the piping segments. The
                company’s station piping program also addresses the other
                potential threats of external corrosion that have been
                identified including corrosion under insulation, cracking,
                mechanical damage and erosion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge implements its station piping program through its
                processes for identifying hazards and threats, and prioritizing
                facilities by risk ranking. The station piping program manager
                and regional Engineering and Operations staff identify the
                hazards and threats, and rank the risk to facilities. The
                company develops an annual scope of work for its priority
                facilities based on hazards, threats and risks identified and
                incorporates learnings and continuous improvement opportunities
                into the station piping program for subsequent cycles of risk
                prioritization.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Lateral Integrity Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge developed its initial station lateral program in
                response to a requirement from the US Department of
                Transportation for a baseline assessment of all line pipe
                affecting a high consequence area. The lateral integrity program
                was later expanded to Enbridge’s Canadian operations due to the
                potential impact on population and environment if a release were
                to occur. The program covers pipelines not included in
                Enbridge’s main pipeline segments, such as station-to-station
                transfer lines. These pipeline segments are typically not
                piggable, except by using tethered inline inspection tools.
                Enbridge performs a risk prioritization based on the likelihood
                and consequence of failure. Enbridge’s Facility Integrity group
                has inspected 10 laterals in Canada to date: 4 in the Western
                Region, 3 in the Central Region and 3 in the Eastern
                Region&nbsp;3. The company has a 15&nbsp;year plan to continue
                baseline inspections on all identified laterals. Re-inspection
                intervals are determined based on a condition assessment of the
                asset and a determination of remaining life based on its
                deterioration rate. Enbridge’s lateral integrity program is
                intended to prevent leaks and ruptures within the company’s
                facilities.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Small Diameter Piping Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge has developed and implemented a Facilities Integrity
                Management Program for small diameter piping located within its
                facilities. Enbridge's small diameter piping program was
                implemented to reduce the frequency of leaks in its facilities
                by replacing installations prone to failure due to vibration of
                small diameter connections. Enbridge presented that 11% of the
                company’s facilities releases in 2014 were due to small diameter
                piping. Enbridge annually develops a scope of work for this
                program that is given to Operations for implementation.
                Enbridge’s small diameter piping integrity program is intended
                to prevent leaks and ruptures within its facilities.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Flange Integrity Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                The company implemented its flange integrity program for its
                buried flanges because it identified this as an area in which
                preventive inspection and maintenance could reduce the number of
                releases. Facilities releases for flanges accounted for 11% of
                the company’s facilities releases. The initial flange integrity
                program focused on threats related to improper assembly, gasket
                damage or degradation, and flange bolt loosening. Enbridge has
                since identified areas of improvement for its flange assembly
                and torqueing procedures that improve the reliability of flanged
                connections. Enbridge’s flange integrity program is intended to
                prevent leaks and ruptures within its facilities.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Above-Ground Storage Tank Integrity Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                This program applies to the company’s breakout tanks,
                above-ground tanks, storage tanks, atmospheric tanks, welded
                steel tanks for oil storage, and oil tanks. Enbridge’s processes
                and procedures for inspection cycles, maintenance intervals and
                long-range planning to address above-ground storage tank
                integrity are in accordance with API&nbsp;653,
                <em
                  >Standard for Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and
                  Reconstruction</em
                >. API&nbsp;653 is the industry standard for above-ground
                storage tanks. Enbridge also has developed and implemented
                procedures to support inspection and maintenance activities.
                Enbridge employs API&nbsp;653 certified inspectors to plan,
                coordinate and provide technical supervision of the company’s
                above-ground storage tank inspections. This was confirmed during
                site inspections in support of the Integrity Management program
                audit. Enbridge’s above-ground storage tank integrity program is
                intended to prevent leaks and ruptures within its facilities.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Underground Tank Replacement and Monitoring</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge has developed and implemented a program for replacing
                and monitoring underground sump tanks. Sump tanks are used
                within Enbridge’s facilities for purposes, such as temporary
                storage of runoff products that contain flammable and/or
                combustible liquids. Enbridge developed its underground tank
                replacement and monitoring program in the 1990’s in response to
                a voluntary guideline issued by the Canadian Council for the
                Ministers of the Environment. This voluntary guideline was
                entitled
                <em
                  >Environmental Code of Practice for Aboveground and
                  Underground Tank Systems Containing Petroleum and Allied
                  Petroleum Products</em
                >. The guideline recommended that all underground single-walled
                steel tanks be replaced with double-walled tanks that include a
                leak detection system. Enbridge has addressed the
                recommendations by focusing on the replacement of underground
                tanks that do not have secondary containment and by monitoring
                the integrity of all other tanks, including repairs and
                replacements as necessary. Enbridge’s underground tank
                replacement and monitoring integrity program is intended to
                prevent leaks and ruptures within its facilities.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Pressure Vessel Integrity Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge has developed and implemented a Facilities Integrity
                Management Program for inspecting, repairing and replacing its
                pressure equipment. Enbridge’s pressure equipment integrity
                program complies with API&nbsp;510,
                <em>Pressure Vessel Inspection Code</em> and CSA&nbsp;B51,
                <em>Inspection and Repair of Certified Pressure Vessels</em>.
                Enbridge employs contract personnel certified as API&nbsp;510
                Authorized Inspectors to plan, coordinate and provide technical
                supervision for the pressure equipment integrity program. The
                pressure vessel integrity program manages 379&nbsp;pressure
                vessels within its Canadian operations. Enbridge’s program also
                includes assessing the integrity of all pressure equipment owned
                and operated by Enbridge Liquids Pipelines. This includes fired
                equipment such as boilers and heaters. Enbridge’s pressure
                vessel integrity program is intended to prevent leaks and
                ruptures within its facilities.

                methodologies, frequency and extent of inspections and data
                evaluation, analysis and recording. Enbridge has conducted gap
                analyses of its station piping program as compared to the
                requirements of API&nbsp;570 and API&nbsp;2611. The company
                determined that the station piping program meets or exceeds most
                of the requirements of the standards. Enbridge identifies some
                areas that require minor improvements and the company made
                recommendations for changes to its practices. In March 2014,
                Enbridge completed a <em>Hazard and Risk Register</em> for its
                Facilities Integrity department. A total of 40 risk scenarios
                were assessed. Enbridge has developed an action plan with
                planned completion dates to address the root cause for each
                identified risk.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Geotechnical Monitoring</em></h5>
              <p>
                CSA&nbsp;Z662 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1(f), (g) and (h) present
                requirements for pipeline monitoring of geotechnical issues.
                Enbridge stated that it developing and implementing its
                geohazard mitigation design.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified that Enbridge’s geohazard management
                program falls within the Pipeline Integrity department. The
                Board was provided evidence that Enbridge’s program was managing
                approximately 500 slopes and 700 watercourse crossings that
                affect NEB regulated pipelines. The Pipeline Integrity
                department’s long-range plan specified the pipelines that should
                receive “smart pig” runs and the frequency of the runs. With
                “smart pig” runs, Enbridge used an Inertial Monitoring Unit to
                monitor slope movement in real time. In 2013, the Pipeline
                Integrity department conducted a geohazard baseline study to
                identify significant slopes and water crossings. Approximately
                520 slopes and 677 water crossings were identified that affect
                NEB regulated pipelines. Additionally, review of Enbridge’s OMM,
                Book&nbsp;3, 03-02-01 identified that its procedure for ROW
                patrols included requirements for monitoring geotechnical
                threats.

              <h5><em>Evaluating Program Effectiveness</em></h5>
              <p>
                As discussed in section&nbsp;3.1, Operations Control - Normal
                Operations of this audit report, Enbridge’s Leak Reduction Team
                reviews all integrity type failures as they relate to each
                monitoring program. This helps ensure that the monitoring
                programs at Enbridge are effective and that appropriate
                mitigations are being used to manage the company’s pipeline
                system. Enbridge evaluates the effectiveness of its leak
                prevention programs through metrics such as the number of leaks
                and ruptures, and contacts (or near-contacts) on pipeline
                facilities.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the program level, Enbridge had met the
                OPR requirements with respect to developing a process for
                inspecting and monitoring of is activities and facilities. The
                Board found that Enbridge was undertaking numerous inspections
                and monitoring activities in support of its Integrity Management
                program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge had implemented its
                surveillance and condition monitoring activities through various
                programs that detect threats, monitor threat progression, and
                reduce or eliminate the threats or hazards at their source.
                Enbridge used various techniques to monitor its system, verify
                pipeline and facility integrity, and confirm that its prevention
                mechanisms are effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, while Enbridge was undertaking many of the
                activities that would normally be undertaken as part of a
                surveillance and monitoring program, it had not developed or
                implemented them in a manner that meets the Board’s program
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, while Enbridge’s procedures and training
                programs for aerial ROW patrols include the requirement for
                observing the conditions and activities set out in
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, the company’s patrol reports did not include
                requirements to develop records that demonstrate verification
                that each required condition and activity was surveyed or
                assessed during the ROW patrols. As such, Enbridge did not
                demonstrate that its aerial surveillance programs comply with
                the requirements of OPR and CSA&nbsp;Z662-11.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                with any process developed to satisfy
                OPR&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>r</em>) and therefore companies must
                demonstrate how they develop adequate and effective corrective

                Enbridge provided its IMS-01&nbsp;4.10 Event Investigation
                Processes, and its IMS-01&nbsp;4.6 Corrective and Preventive
                Action Management (CAPA) Process in support of it meeting the
                requirements of OPR&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>r</em>). The Board found
                that Enbridge’s Event investigation Processes were designed in
                aid of understanding the causes of events from the perspective
                of root and contributory causes to prevent recurrence within the
                Enbridge entities to which it is applied. The processes included
                Event Investigation Principles, Event Impact Criteria and Low
                and Medium and High Impact Event Investigation Processes. The
                IMS-01 4.10 processes were documented in detail. Review of the
                associated process maps indicated that the processes included
                specific links to the IMS-01, 4.6 CAPA process for assurance of
                consistent corrective and preventive action development and
                implementation. Review of the IMS- 01, 4.6 CAPA Process is
                documented below.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that the process maps provided to the Board
                indicated that the processes had not been full established and
                implemented at the time of the Board’s audit. Regardless of the
                full implementation of the processes, the Board was able to see
                evidence of implementation of key investigation process
                activities within Enbridge’s program level activities in its
                audit activities.

              <h5><em>Governance Corrective and Preventative Actions</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge indicated that its IMS,
                section&nbsp;4.6,
                <em>Corrective and Preventive Action Management Process</em>
                defines the minimum standards for administering, tracking and
                managing corrective and preventive actions through their
                implementation and resolution. This process applies to Enbridge
                departments and addresses events, hazards and near-misses. This
                process includes Health Checks, internal reviews, regulatory
                inspections, investigation and audits. The documentation
                provided at the time of the audit does not show that Enbridge’s
                <em>Corrective and Preventative Action Management Process</em>
                has been fully implemented. Portions of the process, according
                to the process map, have only been partially implemented at the
                IMS level.

                The Board notes that the requirement to have a process to take
                corrective and preventive action is included in many of the
                sub-elements within the Board’s audit protocol and the OPR. The
                Board therefore requires the corrective action plan developed to
                address the deficiencies identified for this sub-element to
                explicitly include all sub-element and OPR requirements, where
                corrective and preventive actions are referenced.

              <h5><em>Integrity Management Program Incident Reporting</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board requires the company to have an established,
                implemented and effective process for the internal reporting of
                hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses, and for
                taking corrective and preventive actions, including steps for
                managing imminent hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s Risk Management department is responsible at the
                governance level for the process of internal reporting of
                hazards and potential hazards. The Risk Management department
                compiles information and generates risk reports including an
                annual Liquids Pipelines <em>Risk Report,</em> a Corporate Risk
                Assessment and a quarterly
                <em>Operational Risk Management Report</em>. Further, Pipeline
                Integrity and Facilities Integrity each compile and maintain a
                list of identified risks and hazards in
                <em>Hazard and Risk Registers</em>. The
                <em>Hazard and Risk Registers</em> include planned actions,
                status of planned actions, action owners and planned and actual
                completion dates. Controls to; prevent, manage and mitigate the
                identified hazards and risks are also listed and assessed in
                each of the <em>Hazard and Risk Registers</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the program level, IMS-09, section&nbsp;4.5.7,
                <em>Pipeline Incident Management</em> outlines processes and
                supporting procedures for the internal reporting of hazards,
                potential hazards, incidents and near-misses, and for taking
                corrective and preventive actions, including steps to manage
                imminent hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hazards, potential hazards and threats identified through ROW
                inspections (aerial and land-based) are communicated immediately
                to Enbridge Operations personnel. All hazards and threats found
                during ROW inspections are summarized in daily reports that are
                provided to Enbridge Operations. Employees can access these
                daily reports on the company’s database. Enbridge is a member of
                Alberta One-Call and Saskatchewan First-Call. All hazards,
                potential hazards and threats, including the potential for
                third-party strikes, are reported directly to key Enbridge
                personnel for immediate action and mitigation. Once identified,
                integrity related hazards or potential hazards are reported and
                communicated through various means, depending on the hazards or
                potential hazards. All leaks are reported and communicated
                through Enbridge’s online Leak Reporting System, which is
                accessible by all employees and automatically sends reports to
                key personnel identified in the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s Leak Reduction Team monitors and analyzes causes of
                systemic leaks, and makes recommendations for system-wide
                initiatives for reducing leaks on the Liquid Pipelines system.
                To capture a wide range of experience and knowledge, this team
                is comprised of personnel from several functional areas with
                roles in leak reduction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge has developed an <em>Event Learning Process</em> for
                documenting and managing corrective and preventive actions to
                enhance the company’s Pipeline Integrity Management Program.
                Hazards, incidents and near-misses are included as events within
                this process. The <em>Event Learning Process</em> provides
                procedures and the mechanism for documenting and investigating
                events, developing and completing corrective action plans, and
                documenting learnings. Records and resources for the
                <em>Event Learning Process</em> are available to Enbridge
                employees through the Pipeline Integrity SharePoint site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge integrates the results of its reporting of hazards,
                potential hazards, incidents and near-misses with other data in
                hazard identification and analysis, risk assessments,
                performance measures and annual management reviews, to ensure
                continual improvement. Enbridge’s integrates Enbridge’s list of
                identified risks and the status of these risks into an annual
                Liquids Pipelines <em>Risk Report</em>, a
                <em>Corporate Risk Assessment</em> and a quarterly Operational
                Risk Management Report. These reports and records are supported
                by the data in the Pipeline Integrity and Facilities Integrity
                <em>Hazard and Risk Registers</em>. Enbridge communicates these
                reports directly with staff and by providing them for review on
                its intranet. Progress in managing or mitigating operational
                hazards and risks are communicated to senior management through
                the <em>Operational Risk Management Plan</em>.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has developed and implemented its
                Event Learning Process for documenting and investigating events
                that include hazards, incidents and near-misses. This process
                also included requirements for developing and completing
                corrective action plans, and documenting learnings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, at the governance level, Enbridge’s
                IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.10 Event Investigation Processes, dated
                11-December 2013 had been documented and included in its
                Governing Policies and Processes Management System manual and
                that key activities were being implemented within its programs.
                These processes were, however, identified as “In Progress” and
                therefore not established and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>

              <h4>Expectations:</h4>
              <p>
                The company shall have an established, implemented and effective
                quality assurance program for its management system and for each
                protection program, including a process for conducting regular
                inspections and audits and for taking corrective and preventive
                actions if deficiencies are identified. The audit process should
                identify and manage the training and competency requirements for
                staff carrying out the audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company should integrate the results of its audits with
                other data in hazard identification and analysis, risk
                assessment, performance measures and annual management review,
                to ensure continual improvement in meeting the company’s
                obligations for safety, security and protection of the
                environment.

              <h5><em>Governance Quality Assurance Program</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the Board’s audit, Enbridge indicated that quality
                assurance is implicit within a management system, especially
                within the “Check-Act” elements of the standard
                “Plan-Do-Check-Act” structure to which it follows. Therefore,
                Enbridge’s indicated that it met the Board’s requirements to
                establish and implement a documented Quality Assurance Program
                by having a documented, appropriately designed management system
                that incorporates quality assurance activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing Enbridge’s “Check-Act” elements, the Board noted
                that they do contain a number of activities that would normally
                be considered quality assurance activities. Examples of these
                activities are inspections, audits, data trending, monitoring
                performance measures, etc. Within the limitations of the results
                of the Board’s audit associated with the elements, the Board was
                able to view records of the activities being implemented as
                required.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found, however, that Enbridge’s interpretation of
                Quality Assurance Program is incorrect. The Board has found that
                Enbridge has not met its expectations with respect to
                “programs”. The Board has provided clear guidance as part of the
                guidance notes that accompany the OPR that a program is not
                simply a description of activities. Programs are:” a documented
                set of processes and procedures designed to regularly accomplish
                a result. A program outlines how plans, processes and procedures
                are linked, and how each one contributes toward the result.
                Program planning and evaluation are conducted regularly to check
                that the program is achieving intended results”. The Board’s
                definition is included in Section&nbsp;1.0
                <em>Audit Terminology and Definitions</em> of the attached audit
                report.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Governance Internal Audits</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge indicated that its management system includes processes
                that meet the Board’s auditing process requirements. Enbridge
                indicated that it accounts for the OPR requirements using a
                combination of its Health Check and Internal Review processes.
                While not standard in its approach to conducting audits, the
                Board reviewed Enbridge’s practice to determine whether it met
                the OPR requirements. Additionally, Enbridge indicated that the
                Board should consider the audits completed as part of its
                Internal Auditing program activities as part of its
                demonstration of undertaking the required audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found through its review of documentation and records
                associated with the two referenced processes that they did not
                individually or together constitute a compliant auditing
                process. The Board found that both processes were specifically
                designed not to be exhaustive in their reviews of practice,
                processes or legal requirements. Further, the Internal Review
                process had not been fully established or implemented at the
                time of the audit. Enbridge was in the process of confirming the
                design of the process by conducting a review of one of its
                internal processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Enbridge provided a description of its Internal
                Auditing process and activities as well as selected records of
                completed audits as a demonstration of completing audits. Review
                of the Internal Audit process indicated that it was a process
                designed to be implemented based on corporate risk priorities as
                directed by Enbridge’s senior governance and not a repeatable
                compliance review process applicable directly to the Board’s
                requirements. Additionally, the audit records did not
                demonstrate it had conducted audits compliant with OPR
                sections&nbsp;53 or&nbsp;55.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, Enbridge indicated that it had conducted a number
                of internal and 3rd&nbsp;party assessments of its management
                system against its OPR requirements. Review of the associated
                records provided by Enbridge indicated that they were
                evaluations of the alignment of Enbridge’s management systems
                with the OPR management system and program requirements and did
                not evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness or compliance of the
                company practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s review of Enbridge’s audit processes, audit
                activities completed to date and other linked processes such as
                those related to legal requirements, Enbridge was unable to
                demonstrate that it had completed audits consistent with
                section&nbsp;53 of OPR. Further, the Board finds Enbridge’s
                integrated management system process for conducting audits does
                not meet the Board’s requirements from the perspective of
                present design and of Enbridge’s interpretation of audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, Enbridge’s Health Check and Internal Review
                processes have specific design issues that, when evaluated
                together, do not meet the Board’s audit expectations with
                respect to comprehensiveness of the required audits.
                Additionally, the Board finds that Enbridge’s interpretation
                that the OPR audit requirements can be met using a combination
                of processes conducted over a number years is incorrect. The
                Board notes that there is a common understanding that an audit
                is a discrete verification activity that allows for an
                assessment of conformance/compliance to be made at a given time.
                The Board notes that the comprehensive audits it requires
                necessitates evaluation of systems and programs that require
                evaluation of linked processes and evaluations of the adequacy
                and implementation of the system, programs and processes. This
                requires specific coordination of the reviews in terms of time,
                processes, programs and regions. Enbridge’s present practices,
                based on its interpretation of the regulations, do not allow for
                the required assessments to be made. The Board understands that
                audits often contain a number of different activities; however,
                each activity is coordinated within the auditing process and
                scheduled within the individual plan for the audit.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Auditor Training</em></h5>
              <p>
                This sub-element indicates that a company audit process should
                identify and manage the training and competency requirements for
                staff carrying out the audits. Enbridge did not demonstrate that
                its training and competency activities account for staff
                implementing its audit related processes. The Corrective Action
                Plan associated with the Board’s Non-Compliant finding related
                to Training and Competency and Evaluation as described in
                sub-element&nbsp;3.4 above will need to explicitly address this
                issue.

              <h5>
                <em>Governance Corrective and Preventive Actions Process</em>
              </h5>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit process requirements include establishment and
                implementation of a process for taking corrective and preventive
                actions to address any deficiencies identified by the audits. As
                part of its review of the documentation and records provided by
                Enbridge, the Board reviewed the establishment and
                implementation Enbridge’s corrective and preventive action
                process. The Board found that Enbridge had developed a
                Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Management Process and
                included it within its IMS governance documentation (IMS-01,
                section&nbsp;4.6
                <em>Corrective and Preventive Action Management Process</em>).
                Review of this governance process indicated that it did not meet
                the Board’s process design requirements as outlined in
                Section&nbsp;1.0
                <em>Audit Terminology and Definitions</em> section of the
                attached audit report. For example there are no definitions of
                corrective or preventive actions or appropriate linkages to or
                from other management system processes. Additionally, the
                process map indicated that none of the required steps were fully
                implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the requirement to have a process to take
                corrective and preventive action is included in many of the
                sub-elements within the Board’s audit protocol and the OPR. The
                Board therefore requires the corrective action plan developed to
                address the deficiencies identified for this sub-element to
                explicitly include all sub-element and OPR requirements, where
                corrective and preventive actions are referenced.

              <p>
                As noted above, Enbridge was unable to demonstrate that it has
                an established, implemented and effective quality assurance
                program for its management system and Integrity Management
                Program; however, the company did provide several examples of
                completed audit activities and did provide an overview of
                several integrity related inspection programs which are being
                completed on a regular basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the integrity management program level, Enbridge uses various
                techniques to monitor its system, verify pipeline integrity and
                facility integrity and confirm that its prevention mechanisms
                are effective. Enbridge’s inspection, surveillance and
                monitoring activities are implemented to evaluate the adequacy
                and effectiveness of its protection programs as outlined in
                IMS-09, <em>Pipeline Integrity Management System</em> and
                section&nbsp;5.2,

                existing and proposed regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, Enbridge provided records relating to a number
                of its Integrity Management program audit activities that it had
                completed in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge provided the following examples of audits completed or

                  Management, Western Region Audit, Eastern Region Audit) -
                  Review of these records indicated that the activities focused
                  largely on field operations and included corrective actions,
                  status and timelines.
                </li>

                  Regional/functional reviews - Review of these records
                  indicated that the activities did not focus on Enbridge’s

                  Health Checks for departments and projects - Review of these
                  records indicated that the activities indicated that they were
                  completed as per Enbridge’s requirements, but as described
                  previously did not meet the Board’s requirements.

                  2011 Integrity Management Program Pre-audit and Audit Summary
                  - Review of these records indicated that this activity was
                  based on the USA Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
                  Administration’s

                  assessed compliance with USA and Canadian regulatory
                  requirements. However, the report provided to the Board did
                  not include corrective action plans, timelines or follow-up to
                  findings. For this reason, the Board found that the activity
                  did not constitute an adequate and effective audit of
                  Enbridge’s Integrity Management Program.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                During the review of Enbridge’s Integrity Management program,
                the company indicated that the reviews completed by this and
                other functional or program areas should be considered together
                to demonstrate that it has conducted audits of its program areas
                as required by OPR Section&nbsp;53. Based on its review of the
                documentation and records provided by Enbridge, the Board has
                found that Enbridge has not met its section&nbsp;53 audit
                requirements for this program.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge demonstrated that it is conducting
                many of the activities that normally are contained within a
                quality assurance program on a regular basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found deficiencies with Enbridge’s Quality
                Assurance Program both from the perspective of definition and
                design.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge provided several examples of completed audit related
                activities; however, the Board found deficiencies with respect
                to the design of the management system audit processes and
                activities. The Board also found that Enbridge was not able to
                demonstrate that it has undertaken audits consistent with the
                OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                The company shall have an established, implemented and effective

              <h5><em>Governance Records Management</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the Board’s audit, Enbridge provided the Board with a
                copy of its draft governance Records Management Process. The
                Board’s review indicated that process incorporated its existing
                practices along with new requirements within it. The Board could
                not determine the adequacy of the process as some of the
                referenced Tier&nbsp;2 and 3 documents were not provided with
                Enbridge’s submission. As well, the Board did not find that the
                process was established or implemented as it was considered by
                Enbridge to be in draft format and staff interviewed did not
                refer to it as a required process during interviews. The Board
                found that Enbridge has not established or implemented a
                management system process the meets the OPR requirements. This
                lack of a compliant management system process, however, is not
                indicative of a lack of formal records management within
                Enbridge.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the time of the audit, Enbridge managed
                its records according to its <em>Records Management Policy</em>.
                Based on this policy Enbridge had developed its
                <em>Records Retention Schedule</em> and
                <em>Records Development and Sustainment Standard</em> that
                further guided its records practices. In reviewing these
                documents, the Board found that Enbridge has established
                practices for generating, retaining and maintaining its
                corporate records.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s review of Enbridge’s corporate records management
                practices identified that the company’s Records Management
                department is responsible for developing and maintaining the
                company’s records management requirements and recommended
                processes and that its individual department managers are
                responsible for maintaining and implementing processes and
                practices at the department level. Department managers develop,
                maintain and implement departmental records procedures that are
                aligned with the company’s records management requirements.
                During its audit the Board found that the established
                requirements and practices were being implemented on a
                consistent basis and that the existing requirements were
                incorporated into the draft Records Management Process.

              <p>
                At the program level, Enbridge demonstrated that it has
                established and implemented processes for generating, retaining
                and maintaining records related to the implementation of its
                Integrity Management Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Pipeline Integrity department is responsible for ensuring
                that integrity management records are generated and retained in
                accordance with the company’s records management policies and
                procedures. These policies and procedures are provided by the
                Enbridge <em>Records Retention Schedule</em> and the
                <em>Information Management Records Retention Guideline</em>. The
                <em>Records Retention</em> Schedule identifies
                40&nbsp;categories of information and evidence that define
                business functions, activities, transactions and processes, and
                must therefore be handled according to the creation and
                retention requirements.

                The Pipeline Integrity <em>Data Matrix</em> identifies data
                groups related to pipeline asset information, inline
                inspections, non-destructive examinations, dig information,
                pipeline operating conditions and facility asset information.
                These data groups are subdivided into data elements. Pipeline
                Integrity data management systems are identified for each
                element. These data management systems include OneSource, eDig,
                PipeTrax2, Pressure Restriction Tracking, Maximo, PI Google
                Earth, ILI Run History and Line Summary.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit interviews and site inspections, the Board
                observed evidence of the data management system Enbridge has
                implemented to manage its Integrity Management program records.
                The records obtained from the data management system adhere to
                Enbridge’s Records Classification System and
                <em>Retention Schedule</em>. No issues were identified during
                the audit.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed a draft governance
                Records Management Process as part of it management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge had implemented a consistent
                records management practice for application across its
                organization that resulted in appropriate records management
                practice being implemented at the program and corporate levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, due to the draft nature of the
                process and the lack of Tier&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3 documentation
                provided during the audit, Enbridge did not demonstrate that it
                has established and implemented a management system process that
                meets the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.3 outlines the
                <em>Management System Review Process</em> for ensuring that each
                management system, including IMS-09, is reviewed annually to
                confirm that the desired results are being achieved. As detailed
                in IMS-09, section&nbsp;6.0, <em>Management System Review</em>,
                Pipeline Integrity completes an annual management system review
                of IMS-09 using its PI-84,
                <em>Pipeline Integrity Management System Review</em> procedure.
                Enbridge completes this review to evaluate the overall
                performance of its Integrity Management program. The review also
                enables the company to identify and address areas of improvement
                that may be required to meet specific priorities of the Pipeline
                Integrity department, and the priorities and obligations of the

                <em>Management Review Report</em> and the 2013
                <em>Pipeline Integrity Management System Review Report</em>.
                Both reports demonstrated that Enbridge assesses its Pipeline
                Integrity Management program activities, results and completed
                improvements. The reports also included a list of planned
                improvements. Enbridge indicated that an additional process,

                <em>Accountable Officer Report Development Process</em>, is also
                used to evaluate the management system. The output of the

                implementation of an annual management review, the Board noted
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  IMS-01, <em>Management System Review Process</em> is not fully
                  established; as defined by Enbridge standards, all process
                  steps were considered aspirational;
                </li>
                <li>
                  PC-1801,
                  <em>Accountable Officer Report Development Process</em> is not
                  referenced or inferred in IMS-01 or IMS-09, and thus is not
                  integrated into Enbridge’s management system;
                </li>
                <li>
                  PC-1801,
                  <em>Accountable Officer Report Development Process</em> is not
                  established as per the Board’s working definition (approval
                  date on the document is 21&nbsp;October 2014); and
                </li>
                <li>
                  While certain tasks are being reviewed by practice or by
                  exception, the IMS-09 annual review process does not include a
                  review of the implementation of the Integrity Management
                  program at the operations level.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s Management System
                and Integrity Management Program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge has not established and
                implemented a process for conducting an annual review of its
                management system and protection program. Enbridge will have to
                develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <em>Adequacy and Effectiveness of the Management System</em>
              </h5>
              <p>
                While the Board has listed this requirement under
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1 of the Protocol, Enbridge indicated during
                the audit that its IMS-01,
                <em>Management System Review Process</em> is also used to
                evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the company’s
                management system. When reviewing the content of this governance
                process, Enbridge indicated that each process within the
                management system is reviewed to ensure effectiveness.
                Enbridge’s IMS-09,
                <em>Management System Review Process</em> overviews this
                requirement. Enbridge has developed an additional process,
                PC-1701, <em>Management System Evaluation Process</em>. The
                PC-1701 process includes an evaluation of the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the overall management system. Records provided
                to demonstrate implementation of these processes include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  2012 and 2013 Pipeline Integrity Management System Review

                </li>
                <li>

                <li>3rd Party Assessment (Dynamic Risk) completed in 2013.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Upon review of the various processes and records supporting the
                implementation of a process for evaluating the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the company’s management system, the Board
                noted the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  IMS-01, <em>Management System Review Process</em> is not fully
                  established; as defined by Enbridge standards, all process
                  steps were considered aspirational;
                </li>
                <li>
                  IMS-01, <em>Management Review Process</em> does not include an
                  evaluation of the adequacy of the management system;
                </li>
                <li>
                  PC-1701, <em>Management System Evaluation Process</em> is not
                  referenced or inferred in IMS-01 or IMS-09, and thus is not
                  integrated into Enbridge’s management system;
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Internal Management System Alignment Assessment</em>
                  describes assessing adequacy, effectiveness and implementation
                  of processes, but it is based on the OPR requirements and not
                  an evaluation of Enbridge’s management system as designed;
                </li>
                <li>
                  3<sup>rd</sup> Party Assessment (Dynamic Risk) is strictly an
                  alignment/compliance assessment to the OPR&nbsp;6.1-6.6
                  requirements and does not attest to the adequacy or
                  effectiveness of Enbridge’s management system (IMS&nbsp;01 et
                  al); and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Records from the IMS-09,
                  <em>Management Review Process</em> could not confirm that the
                  management system has been fully reviewed for adequacy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge has not established and
                implemented a process for evaluating the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the management system. Enbridge will have to
                develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Annual Report</em></h5>
              <p>
                Enbridge develops an
                <em>Annual Accountable Officer Report</em> that describes the
                performance of the company’s management system in meeting its
                obligations for safety, security and protection of the
                environment. The report also describes the company’s performance
                in achieving its goals, objectives and targets during that year.
                The company’s performance is evaluated against the performance
                measures developed under the management system and any actions
                taken that year to correct deficiencies identified by the
                quality assurance program. The PC-1801,
                <em>Accountable Officer Report Development Proces</em>s
                describes the required process for developing the
                <em>Annual Accountable Officer Report</em>. According to this
                process, the Annual Accountable Officer Report must
                <em
                  >“detail the performance of Enbridge LP management system and
                  will cover areas of leadership, performance measures, internal
                  review, management review and corrective actions taken.”</em
                >
                The report must also include details about achievement of goals,
                objectives and targets during that year as assessed through
                performance measures.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the PC-1801,
                <em>Accountable Officer Report Development Process</em>,
                Enbridge must complete its
                <em>Annual Accountable Officer Report</em>, have it signed by
                the accountable officer, and submit it to the Board no later
                than April&nbsp;30 of each year. The Board confirmed that the
                <em>Annual Accountable Officer Report</em> for the 2013
                performance year was signed by the accountable officer and
                submitted to the Board by 30&nbsp;April 30 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon review of the <em>Annual Report</em>, the Board noted that
                the report does reference some internal and external reviews
                conducted on the management system. The
                <em>Annual Report</em> also includes a section that describes
                the actions taken that year to address deficiencies. However,
                Enbridge’s <em>Annual Report</em> does not specify the
                deficiencies and actions items, and does not focus on the
                development and status of the management system. While it is
                important to communicate this information to the accountable
                officer, it is not fully representative of Board’s quality
                assurance program requirement (see sub-element&nbsp;4.3). Thus,
                it is unclear whether the accountable officer is aware of the
                actions taken that year to address deficiencies identified by
                the quality assurance program. The Board also noted that the
                deficiencies identified in sub-elements&nbsp;1.2 and&nbsp;2.3
                will need to be addressed in future annual reports.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Management Responsibility</em></h5>
              <p>
                Further to the review of these processes and activities, the
                Board notes that Enbridge has not conducted audits consistent
                with its OPR obligations. The Board views the responsibility for
                undertaking these audits as resting with the company’s senior
                management (as represented by its Accountable Officer) as the
                annual report developed as per OPR specifically requires review
                and reporting on aspects of the Quality Assurance Program
                (specifically including audits) and the performance of the
                management system in meeting its obligations under OPR
                section&nbsp;6. Additionally, the Board has made Non-Compliant
                findings related Sub-elements&nbsp;1.2
                <em>Policy and Commitment Statements</em> and&nbsp;2.3
                <em>Goals, Objectives and Targets</em> that relate to the
                development of explicit policies and goals required by the OPR.
                While the Board’s Non-Compliant findings are mitigated by the
                nature of the deficiencies (implicit inclusion vs. explicit
                requirements), it is the responsibility of company management to
                ensure the development and implementation of compliant policies
                and goals that guide the companies management system and
                programs.
              </p>
              <h5><em>Summary</em></h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed processes for and
                undertaken activities relating to its Management Review
                responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge’s processes did not meet all
                of the requirements outlined in the OPR. Additionally, the Board
                has found that Enbridge has not conducted audits consistent with
                the requirements of OPR section&nbsp;53.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Integrity Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>

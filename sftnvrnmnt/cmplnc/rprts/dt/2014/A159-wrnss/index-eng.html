              <p>
                The National Energy Board has completed its Final Audit Report
                for its audit of Alliance’s Public Awareness Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                A draft report documenting the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s
                Public Awareness Program was provided to Alliance on
                26&nbsp;February 2016 for review and comment. On 17&nbsp;March
                2016, Alliance submitted its response.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has considered Alliance’s comments and has made
                changes to the Final Audit Report and its Appendices as it
                determined to be appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of
                whether Alliance was compliant with the regulatory requirements
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>

              </ul>
              <p>
                Alliance was required to demonstrate the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the methods selected and employed within its
                Programs to meet the regulatory requirements listed above.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has enclosed the Final Audit Report and associated
                appendices with this letter. The Board will make the Final Audit
                Report and Appendices public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance is required to file a Corrective Action Plan (CAP),
                which describes the methods and timing for addressing the
                Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for
                approval by the Board prior to <strong>2&nbsp;May 2016</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the CAP public and will continue to monitor
                and assess all of Alliance’s corrective actions with respect to
                this audit until they are fully implemented. The Board will also
                continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                Alliance’s Public Awareness Program and management system
                through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of
                its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and environmental protection.
                Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to
                incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations. These systems and
                associated technical management programs include the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure NEB regulated
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. In the public
                interest, the Board holds companies accountable for safety and
                environmental outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s comprehensive audit of
                Alliance’s Public Awareness program as it applies to its NEB
                pipeline facilities. The audit was conducted based on the
                requirements contained within the
                <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Crossings Regulations</em>
                (PCR),
                <em
                  >Canadian Standards Association Standard Z662-11 - Oil and Gas
                  Pipeline Systems</em
                >
                (CSA&nbsp;Z662-11) as well as the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. The Board has
                incorporated these requirements within its audit protocol.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published audit
                protocol, which identifies five&nbsp;management system elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
                regulatory requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a
                company’s program is found to be deficient with respect to any
                regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element will be found
                Non-Compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the companies it regulates must establish
                and implement documented management systems and apply them to
                the programs as described within the OPR as well as their
                Crossings and Public Awareness programs.  The specific
                management system requirements are described within
                section&nbsp;6 of the OPR and within the referenced
                CSA&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Z662,
                <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em> in clause&nbsp;3.1
                <em>Safety and Loss Management System</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing the results of Alliance’s Public Awareness program
                audit the Board notes that Alliance did not demonstrate it had
                developed and implemented a management system that directly
                applies to this program. The Board notes that the Public
                Awareness program management system requirements can be met by
                being directly subsumed within the programs referenced in the
                OPR or as part of a documented Safety and Loss Management System
                compliant with clause&nbsp;3.1 of CSA&nbsp;Z662
                <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em>. The Board did not see
                evidence that Alliance had implemented either approach.
                 Further, the Board notes that the requirements to have a
                documented, implemented and maintained Safety and Loss
                Management System are not new.  The Board is of the view that
                this management system deficiency could have been prevented if
                Alliance had ensured that appropriate compliance identification
                and monitoring processes had been established.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Public Awareness program is part of Alliance’s Land, Right
                of Way and Corridor Management department.  During the audit,
                Alliance provided evidence that it was in the process of
                applying its corporate Operational Risk Management System to its
                Land, Right of Way and Corridor Management department.  Alliance
                demonstrated that some of the required processes had already
                been integrated into its program management activities; however,
                at the time of the audit, the Operational Risk Management System
                had not been fully documented, established or implemented for
                the Land, Right of Way and Corridor Management programs.
                Alliance will need to develop and implement corrective actions
                to ensure establishment and implementation of a compliant
                management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to understand that the Board’s finding regarding
                Alliance’s management system primarily reflects the company’s
                stage in developing and applying its management system. It does
                not necessarily reflect the lack of technical management
                activities being undertaken to ensure the safety of the
                pipeline. The Board found that, regardless of the lack of a
                compliant management system, Alliance had developed and
                implemented a Public Awareness program that was addressing the
                majority and most significant of its hazards and the majority of
                its regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has made a significant number of Non-Compliant
                findings. The Board’s analysis of these findings indicates that
                most of the non-compliances relate to the establishment and
                implementation of the management system processes and
                consequently its Safety and Loss Management System. All of the
                Board’s findings are documented in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/A159-wrnss/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of the Non-Compliant findings fall into two
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  ack of integration of its Public Awareness program into the
                  overall operational oversight management system processes: and
                </li>
                <li>
                  failure to implement management system sub-elements that are
                  consistent with the Board’s expectations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Alliance must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval. The Corrective Action
                Plan must detail how Alliance intends to resolve non-compliances
                identified by this audit. The Board will assess the
                implementation of the corrective actions to confirm they are
                completed in a timely manner and applied consistently across
                Alliance’s regulated system. The Board will also continue to
                monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of
                Alliance’s management system through targeted compliance
                verification activities as a part of its ongoing regulatory
                mandate.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses
                the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains
                the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent
                basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented,
                meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements
                of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> and its associated
                regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained
                on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others
                working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the
                process or other requirement. Records and interviews have
                provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as
                prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially
                utilized).

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5 (1)(<em>o</em>). With records, the
                company must demonstrate that it meets the records management
                requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5 (1)(<em>p</em>).

                <strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR
                sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach
                designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote
                continual improvement. The system includes the organizational
                structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and
                procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations
                related to safety, security and Environmental Protection.

                  evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers
                  more than the specific requirements of section&nbsp;6.1. It
                  considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and
                  implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its
                  management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its
                  organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6.4; and

                  and/or maintenance of the processes, inventory and list
                  described in section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in

              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must

              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps

                individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe
                manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities

                <em
                  >OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) describes the Board’s required
                  management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                  management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                  process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                  developed or maintained as described within each section;
                  whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                  designed to address the requirements of the process, for
                  example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards
                  and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit
                  required actions including roles, responsibilities and
                  authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing
                  the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common
                  5&nbsp;w’s and h&nbsp;approach (who, what, where, when, why
                  and how). The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have
                  multiple requirements; companies may therefore establish and
                  implement multiple processes, as long as they are designed to
                  meet the legal requirements and integrate any processes
                  linkages contemplated by the OPR section. Processes must
                  incorporate or contain linkage to procedures, where required
                  to meet the process requirements.</em

                <em
                  >As the processes constitute part of the management system,
                  the required processes must be developed in a manner that
                  allows them to function as part of the system. The required
                  management system is described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The
                  processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the
                  company following its policies and goals established and
                  required by section&nbsp;6.3.</em

                <em
                  >Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each process
                  must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the
                  programs referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be
                  compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which
                  considers the specific technical requirements associated with
                  each program and is applied to and meets the process
                  requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that
                  single process may not meet all of the programs; in these
                  cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as
                  long as they meet the process requirements (as described
                  above) and direct the program processes to be established and
                  implemented in a consistent manner that allows for the
                  management system to function as described in 6.1.</em

                procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program
                outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in
                other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company

              <h2 id="s3">3.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to ensure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection
                of the environment. To do this, the Board has developed
                regulations requiring companies to establish and implement
                documented management systems applicable to specified technical
                management and protection programs. These management systems and
                programs must take into consideration all applicable
                requirements of the NEB Act and its associated regulations, as
                well as the <em>Canada Labour Code Part&nbsp;II</em> (CLC).
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve compliance, regulated companies must demonstrate
                established, implemented, adequate and effective methods for
                identifying and managing hazards and risks. The Board reviews
                the documented compliance and incident history of the company.
                This review determines the appropriate scope for the audit.
                During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and some
                company records, and interviews of both corporate and
                regionally-based staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also conducts separate but linked technical
                inspections of a representative sample of the company’s
                facilities to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness and
                implementation of the management system and programs. The Board
                bases the scope and location of the inspections on the needs of
                the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard
                inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the
                audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If
                unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an
                inspection, they are actioned in accordance with the Board’s
                standard inspection and enforcement processes to ensure ongoing
                safe operation
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines the
                Board’s audit activities, provides an evaluation of the
                company’s management system and programs identifies deficiencies
                and communicates compliance findings. The audit report follows
                the format of the Board’s published Audit Protocol. Once the
                Board issues the Final Audit Report, the company must submit and
                implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all Non-Compliant
                findings for Board approval. Final Audit Reports are published
                on the Board’s website. The audit results are integrated into
                NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.

              <p>
                Alliance operates approximately 1,600&nbsp;km of pipeline in
                three Canadian provinces. These pipeline facilities include
                mainline and lateral compressor stations, mainline block valves
                and associated operational assets. All of these facilities are
                within the definition of a “pipeline” as included in the NEB
                Act. Alliance also has a considerable amount of infrastructure
                in the United States, which completes its North American system.
                Alliance’s system allows it to transport rich natural gas from
                the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and the Williston Basin
                to end-users in the United States Midwest and other downstream
                markets. In order for Alliance to operate its pipelines
                effectively, it has developed a management structure that
                reflects its safety and security management, and environmental
                obligations, as well as its corporate, national, and regional
                needs.
              </p>

                of this report.
              </p>
              <p>
                During audit planning, company staff indicated that Alliance
                operates its pipelines and facilities using a common management
                system and technical programs. In order to effectively evaluate
                compliance of such an expansive system within a reasonable
                timeframe, the Board chose to conduct individual, comprehensive
                audits of Alliance’s required technical programs and management
                system. This report documents one of five&nbsp;management system
                and program audits. The audits are titled:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Alliance Safety Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Alliance Environmental Protection Program Audit;</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Alliance Emergency Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Alliance Third-Party Crossings Program Audit; and</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Alliance Public Awareness Program Audit.</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Audit results confirmed that Alliance operates its facilities
                using a common organizational structure to implement a common
                management system that applies to all of its business and
                operational activities. Some findings are therefore similar in
                each audit and the individual audit reports reflect this.

              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to determine the establishment
                and implementation of Alliance’s management system and the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its Public Awareness program.
                Alliance was audited against the requirements contained within
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>;

              </ul>
              <p>
                This audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. This amendment clarified
                the Board’s expectations for establishing and implementing a
                documented management system applicable to specified programs.
                Public Awareness programs are not directly referenced within the
                OPR; however, the hazards addressed by Public Awareness programs
                are considered to be subsumed within the integrity, emergency,
                environmental and safety management programs. Before issuing the
                amendment, the Board consulted and communicated its regulated
                companies with respect to the new requirements; therefore, an
                implementation grace period was not given when the OPR was
                promulgated. As a result, when evaluating compliance, this audit
                did not consider any extra time Alliance may have needed to
                implement changes.

              <p>
                In undertaking this audit, the Board has applied its standard
                audit practice following its published protocols. The Board’s
                standard practice and audit activities include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Formal notification of the Board’s intent to audit by letter;
                </li>
                <li>Interactive planning processes with the company;</li>
                <li>Information gathering;</li>
                <li>Documentation and record review;</li>
                <li>
                  Program presentations by company personnel and interviews with
                  company personnel;

                <li>
                  Developing, finalizing and issuing the Final Audit Report;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reviewing and approving any required Corrective Action Plans;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reviewing implementation of Corrective Action Plans; and
                </li>
                <li>Issuing closure letters.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These audit activities allow the company to demonstrate whether
                its management system and programs comply. Audits also allow the
                Board to evaluate the company with respect to: assuring
                compliance to regulatory requirements; and assuring appropriate
                safety, security and environmental outcomes as described in the
                Board’s expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Alliance uses a common management system and Public
                Awareness program and at the time of the audit divided its
                Canadian assets into four operational regions: Grande Prairie,
                Whitecourt/Morinville, Kerrobert, and Regina. The Board
                therefore developed its audit plan to evaluate Alliance’s
                management system and Public Awareness program and to assure
                that it was appropriate to manage and applied to all of its
                regulated facilities regardless of location. To this end, the
                Board conducted interviews, inspections and documentation and
                record reviews in each region as well as the Calgary office. It
                is the Board’s expectation that any audit Non-Compliant findings
                made and corrective actions required by the Board must be
                applied across all of Alliance’s Board regulated systems.

              <p>
                The Board informed Alliance of its intent to audit its NEB
                regulated facilities in a letter dated 24&nbsp;June 2014.
                Following the issuance of that letter, Board audit staff met
                with Alliance staff on a regular basis to arrange and coordinate
                this audit. The Board also provided Alliance with an information
                guidance document to help Alliance prepare for the audit as well
                as to provide access to documentation and records to demonstrate
                its compliance. Alliance established a digital access portal for
                Board staff to review documentation and records.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 27&nbsp;April 2015, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from Alliance in Calgary, Alberta to confirm the
                Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. The opening meeting
                was followed by Calgary office interviews from 27&nbsp;April to

                From 30&nbsp;July to 6 August 2015, the Board held an audit
                pre-close-out meeting with Alliance. At this meeting Board staff
                and Alliance staff discussed potential deficiencies identified
                during field activities and discussed additional information
                that could be of value to the Board prior to compiling its draft
                audit report. An audit close-out meeting was held on
                30&nbsp;September 2015 to provide Alliance with a description of
                the recommendations that staff would be bringing to the Board
                for decision.

              <h2 id="s8">8.0 Management System Evaluation</h2>
              <p>
                The Public Awareness program activities are required to be
                formally managed within a documented and implemented management
                system. The Board notes that this program requires the
                development and implementation of a documented management system
                either directly subsumed within the management system and the
                applicable programs described in the OPR or as part of a
                documented Safety and Loss Management System required by
                clause&nbsp;3.1 of CSA&nbsp;Z662 Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s management system requirements are found in
                section&nbsp;6 of the OPR and within the referenced
                CSA&nbsp;Z662 Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems clause&nbsp;3.1
                Safety and Loss Management System. The Board notes that the
                Public Awareness program is not specifically referenced within
                section&nbsp;55 of the OPR and therefore is not subject to the
                same organizational requirements as other referenced programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, while Alliance has demonstrated that it is
                in the process of applying its Operational Risk Management
                System to its Land, Right of Way and Corridor Management
                functions and has accounted for many of the processes described
                within the Board’s protocol and the legal requirements, it did
                not demonstrate that it has developed and implemented a
                documented management system that meets the Board’s
                requirements.  Further, the Board notes that some of the key
                management system activities were not designed appropriately or
                being undertaken as required.  As an example, Alliance’s
                internal auditing practices were not designed in a manner that
                require a full management system or an audit that verifies its
                compliance to all of its regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found Alliance to be Non-Compliant with its
                requirements to develop, implement and maintain a documented
                management system.  Alliance will need to develop and implement
                corrective actions to ensure establishment and implementation of
                a management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that it is important to understand that the
                Board’s management system Non-Compliant finding reflects
                Alliance’s development and implementation of its management
                system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of technical
                management activities being undertaken to ensure the safety of
                the public, workers or the environment.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate Public Awareness programs into their
                day-to-day operations. These programs must include the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure that workers and the
                public are safe through the provision of adequate and effective
                awareness.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has established and implemented a
                Public Awareness program that provides external stakeholders
                with information regarding living and working around its
                facilities. As well, this program develops and distributes
                information related to emergency response to first responders
                and other stakeholders. Alliance’s Public Awareness program
                also:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  undertakes activities to reach its identified stakeholders;

                </li>
                <li>
                  is positioned where it can best be leveraged within the Land,
                  Right of Way and Corridor Management and Health and Safety
                  Departments.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, Alliance was in the process of
                developing and implementing the Operational Risk Management
                System which, if implemented, may address many of the
                deficiencies noted in this audit.

              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published Audit
                Protocol, which identifies five&nbsp;Management System elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
                regulatory requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a
                company’s program is deficient in any regulatory requirement,
                the entire sub-element will be found non-compliant. The company
                will have to develop a corrective action plan to demonstrate to
                the Board that appropriate actions will be taken to achieve full
                compliance.

                The following summary is a high-level overview of the Board’s
                audit findings for Alliance’s Public Awareness program based on

              <h3>Element&nbsp;1.0 &ndash; Policy and Commitment</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 &ndash; Leadership and Accountability
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must appoint an Accountable Officer and notify the Board
                of the appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance had submitted a written notice to the NEB indicating
                that it had appointed an Accountable Officer. In its submission,
                Alliance confirmed that its Accountable Officer had authority
                over the human and financial resources required to meet the
                Board’s substantive expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided by Alliance, the Board has not
                identified any non-compliance issues. The Board has therefore
                assessed this sub-element as Compliant.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 &ndash; Policy and Commitment Statements
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have documented policies and goals to ensure the
                safety and security of the public, workers, and the pipeline and
                ensure protection of property and the environment. Further, as
                these policies and goals are to be used to establish and
                implement the management and protection programs, the Board
                requires that the policies and goals be explicit from the
                perspective of design, content and communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had corporate and program level
                policies and goals that related to the Public Awareness program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the many policies, programs and initiatives that
                Alliance had developed to direct and support its Public
                Awareness program, the Board identified non-compliance in the
                Policy and Commitment Statements sub-element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance did not demonstrate that it had a policy that was fully
                explicit on the internal reporting of hazards, potential
                hazards, incidents and near misses (in that there was no pointed
                reference to “potential hazards”). Furthermore, Alliance’s
                policy statement did not fully describe the conditions under
                which a person making a report will be granted immunity from
                disciplinary action (in that there was no explanation as to what
                constituted good-faith reporting).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and the Public Awareness program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;2.0 &ndash; Planning</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.1 &ndash; Hazard Identification, Risk
                Assessment and Control
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential
                hazards, assessing the degree of risk associated with the
                hazards, and implementing control measures to minimize or
                eliminate risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance has established and
                implemented a practice for the identification of some hazards
                and potential hazards that applies to its Public Awareness
                program. However, the Board could not verify that Alliance has
                implemented a process to add and evaluate new hazards or
                potential hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance did not demonstrate that it has
                established and maintained an inventory of all hazards and
                potential hazards introduced by third parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a process for the evaluation and managing of the
                risks associated with the identified hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s Public Awareness
                program against the requirements, the Board has determined that
                Alliance is Non-Compliant with this sub-element. Alliance will
                have to develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 &ndash; Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and monitoring compliance with all legal
                requirements applicable to the company. The company must also
                maintain a list of the legal requirements that apply to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance demonstrated that it was tracking,
                listing and communicating some of its legal requirements related
                to the Public Awareness program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had developed and implemented
                practices to communicate the legal requirements internally and
                with third parties   Also, Alliance demonstrated that it was
                communicating new or revised legal requirements to third-parties
                through its Public Awareness program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance’s methods to monitor its
                legal requirements and compliance to them did not meet the
                Board’s requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance’s legal list was not kept at the
                level of specificity required to enable the company to ensure
                and monitor its compliance with the legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s Public Awareness
                program against the requirements, the Board has determined that
                Alliance is Non-Compliant with this sub-element. Alliance will
                have to develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.

                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the

                process for developing and setting goals, objectives and
                specific targets for the risks and hazards associated with the

              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance demonstrated that its Public
                Awareness staff plays a role in supporting the Emergency

                Non-compliant finding will not be made in this sub-element. In
                order to ensure that related issues are addressed for this

                program. The Board found, however, that Alliance had not
                organized them within a program as required by the OPR nor had
                it been audited to its legal requirements as per the Board’s
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance had not developed processes
                for conducting audits nor has completed an audit that meet the
                Board’s requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s Public Awareness
                program against the requirements, the Board has determined that
                Alliance is Non-Compliant with this sub-element. Alliance will
                have to develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.4 &ndash; Records Management</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element states that a company must establish and
                implement an effective process for generating, retaining, and
                maintaining records that document the implementation of the
                management system and its protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had implemented consistent records
                management practices to document the implementation of its
                Public Awareness program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a Public Awareness program process that meets the
                OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s Public Awareness
                program against the requirements, the Board has determined that
                Alliance is Non-Compliant with this sub-element. Alliance will
                have to develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;5.0 &ndash; Management Review</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;5.1 &ndash; Management Review</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element states that a company must establish and
                implement an effective process for conducting an annual
                management review of the management system and each protection
                program and for ensuring continual improvement in meeting the
                company’s obligations. This sub-element also requires a company
                to complete an annual report for the previous calendar year,
                signed by the accountable officer, describing the performance of
                the company’s management system in meeting its obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had developed processes for and
                undertaken activities relating to its Management Review
                responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance’s processes did not meet all
                of the requirements outlined in the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that some of the Non-Compliant findings in
                this audit are related to sub- elements where Alliance’s Senior
                Management has responsibilities to ensure that management
                direction, oversight and formal monitoring are occurring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Public Awareness program against the requirements, the Board
                has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive
                commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and
                environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s
                regulation must establish and implement effective management
                systems in their day-to-day operations. This includes the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure workers are and the
                public are safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has made a significant number of Non-Compliant
                findings. The Board’s analysis of these findings indicates that
                most of the non-compliances relate to the establishment and
                implementation of the management system processes and
                consequently its Safety and Loss Management System.  All of the
                Board’s findings are documented in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/A159-wrnss/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of the Non-Compliant findings fall into two
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  lack of integration of its Public Awareness program into the
                  overall operational oversight management system processes; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  failure to implement management system sub-elements that are
                  consistent with the Board’s expectations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In reviewing the results of Alliance’s Public Awareness program
                audit the Board notes that Alliance did not demonstrate it had
                developed and implemented a management system that directly
                applies to this program. Further, the Board notes that the
                requirements to have a documented, implemented and maintained
                management system are not new as the Safety and Loss Management
                System requirements have been included in CSA&nbsp;Z662 for a
                number of years and pre-date the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, regardless of the lack of a compliant
                management system, Alliance had developed and implemented a
                Public Awareness program that was addressing the majority and
                most significant of its hazards and the majority of its
                regulatory requirements. The Board found that Alliance has
                established and implemented a Public Awareness program that
                provides external stakeholders with information regarding living
                and working around its facilities. As well, this program
                develops and distributes information related to emergency
                response to first responders and other stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address these Non-Compliant findings.
                Upon receipt of the Final Audit Report, Alliance must develop a
                corrective action plan describing its proposed methods to
                resolve the non-compliances identified and the timeline in which
                corrective actions will be completed. Alliance is required to
                submit its corrective action plan for Board approval within
                30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued. The Board
                will make its Final Audit Report and Alliance’s approved
                corrective action plan public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of Alliance’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of Alliance’s Public Awareness
                program and management system as a whole through targeted
                compliance verification activities as a part of its ongoing
                regulatory mandate.

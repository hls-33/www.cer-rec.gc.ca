                The ORMS Policy document also defines the accountability and
                responsibility with the CEO responsibilities and all employees,
                contractors and consultants’ responsibilities described.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has verified that Alliance’s Accountable Officer has
                prepared a policy statement that sets out Alliance’s commitment
                to these policies as outlined in the ORMS Policy. The policy
                statement includes commitments to the protection of people,
                property, environment and to the use of ORMS.
              </p>
              <p>
                Commitments are made to employee-partners to encourage the
                reporting of all incidents, hazards, near misses and risks and
                protecting employee-partners and contractors who report in good
                faith from any form of retaliation for reporting. The policy is
                available to all personnel at Alliance through the company
                intranet. The Board verified through record review and
                interviews with Alliance representatives that Alliance
                communicated the ORMS Policy to its employee-partners.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the ORMS Policy substantially meets the OPR requirements,
                it does not explicitly refer to the reporting of ‘potential
                hazards’ as required by the regulation. Review of the supplied
                information also identified that the Alliance policies did not
                explicitly identify the conditions under which a person who
                makes such a report will be granted immunity as part of the
                reporting policy. The Board notes that the policies are required
                to be explicit with respect to reporting and what to report in
                order to, not only encourage reporting but also to clearly
                identify what to report. Alliance’s statements would require
                interpretation prior to reporting thus potentially slowing down
                hazard management and mitigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also notes that during the audit, Alliance was in the
                process of revising its management system to explicitly account
                for the OPR requirements. An updated framework was provided to
                the Board and while additional time is required to fully
                establish, implement and maintain its management system,
                Alliance was able to demonstrate that its management system is
                based upon the established policies referred to above and as
                required by OPR, section&nbsp;6.3(2).
              </p>
              <h5>Environmental Protection Program Policy</h5>
              <p>
                Alliance demonstrated during the audit that it has developed,
                implemented and maintained an
                <em>Environmental Management System</em> (EMS) that is
                equivalent to the OPR required Environmental Protection program.
                Alliance also demonstrated that it has established an
                Environmental Policy that includes a commitment to protect the
                environment by striving for zero incidents; meeting or exceeding
                all applicable regulations; proactively understanding and
                mitigating potential risks with the aim of pollution prevention
                and by promoting continuous improvement of the EMS and processes
                to achieve higher standards of environmental stewardship. This
                policy is made available through the company internal intranet
                and was also posted at all offices visited by the Board during
                the audit. Through interviews and documentation review, Alliance
                demonstrated its Environmental Protection program is based upon
                this policy.
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has developed policies and policy
                statements to meet the requirement of OPR, section&nbsp;6.3(1).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has based its management system
                and Environmental Protection program on these policies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found the following areas of non-compliance in
                the Policy and Commitment Statements sub-element:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alliance did not demonstrate that it has a policy that
                  explicitly describes internal reporting of potential hazards
                  as required by OPR, section&nbsp;6.3(1)(<em>a</em>); and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alliance did not demonstrate that its policy includes the
                  conditions under which a person who reports a hazard,
                  potential hazard, incident or near-miss will be granted
                  immunity from disciplinary action as required by OPR,
                  section&nbsp;6.3(1)(<em>a</em>);
                </li>
              </ul>
              Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
              and Environmental Protection program against the requirements, the
              Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with this
              sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective actions to
              address the described deficiencies.

                the risks associated with these hazards, including the risks
                related to normal and abnormal operating conditions. As part of
                its formal risk assessment, a company shall keep records to

                Process
              </h5>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, the identification of hazards and
                potential hazards was being completed at the various protection
                program levels and not by an established and implemented
                management system process as required by OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>c</em>). Alliance did demonstrate
                through its revised ORMS framework that it is in the process of
                developing a hazard identification process. The Board notes that
                while a management system deficiency currently exists, the Board
                did verify that hazards are being identified through established
                program level practices (please refer to Environmental
                Protection program hazard identification below).
              </p>
              <h5>Management System Hazard and Potential Hazard Inventory</h5>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, Alliance did not demonstrate that it
                has established and maintained an inventory of hazards and
                potential hazards at the management system level. The Board has
                verified that various inventories have been established at the
                protection program level and this is this described in the
                sections below.
              </p>
              <h5>Management System Evaluating and Managing Risk Process</h5>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, the evaluation and managing of risks
                was being primarily completed at the various protection program
                levels and not by an established and implemented management
                system process as required by OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>e</em>). Alliance did demonstrate it has
                developed a corporate risk matrix for each of the protection
                programs to use to guide risk ranking and prioritization of
                identified hazards and that risks are reviewed during management
                review meetings. Alliance has also demonstrated that through its
                revised ORMS framework that it is in the process of developing a
                risk assessment and control process. The Board notes that while
                a management system deficiency currently exists, the Board did
                verify that risks are being evaluated and managed through
                established protection program level practices.

              <h5>
                Environmental Protection Program Hazard and Potential Hazard
                Identification and Risk Assessment Process
              </h5>
              <p>
                Alliance’s EMS includes an element on hazard assessment and risk
                management, referred to specifically as environmental aspect
                identification and evaluation, of which Alliance has developed a
                documented practice to identify and evaluate environmental
                aspects at its facilities and operations. This practice includes
                several mechanisms for identifying environmental hazards and
                potential hazards such as pre-job meetings, facility and
                equipment inspections and Alliance’s project process. Through a
                review of records, Alliance was able to demonstrate that its
                environmental hazard identification practice has been fully
                implemented. In addition, interviews with Alliance
                representatives indicated that members of Alliance’s
                Environmental department were trained on this practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance’s documented practice also includes evaluating the risk
                associated with the identified environmental hazards so that
                these risks can be potentially eliminated, controlled or
                mitigated. As part of its demonstration, Alliance provided
                records indicating that their assessment included both the
                unmitigated (without controls) and mitigated risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Alliance has demonstrated compliance with certain aspects
                of the OPR requirements in this sub-element, the Board notes the
                following deficiencies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Documented practice focuses on new hazards being identified
                  and does account for how existing hazards were identified;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Documented practice does not include the identification and
                  analysis of potential hazards; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Documented practice does not meet the Board’s definition of a
                  process as it does not include the Board’s common 5 “w”s and
                  “h” approach (who, what, where, when, why and how). Further to
                  this, Alliance has developed an internal document hierarchy,
                  which includes when a process (amongst other type of
                  documents) should be developed and how it is defined. The
                  Board reviewed this definition and determined that it does
                  align with the Board expectations; however, it is not being
                  used consistently in the organization.

              <p>
                Through its existing practices, Alliance demonstrated that it is
                has established and implemented an inventory of its identified
                Environmental Protection program hazards. This inventory
                includes, but is not limited to, hazards relating to invasive
                plants, surface water, waste management and air emissions. The
                Board found these to be appropriate for Alliance’s operations.
                However, the Board did note that this inventory did not include
                potential hazards as required by the OPR.
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system process for the
                identification of hazards and potential hazards as required by
                the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that while a management system deficiency
                currently exists, the Board did verify that hazards are being
                identified and controlled through established Environmental
                Protection program level practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance did not demonstrate that it has
                established and maintained an inventory of hazards and potential
                hazards at the management system level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance established and maintained an
                inventory at the Environmental Protection program level.
                However, this inventory did not include potential hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system for the evaluation
                and managing of the risks associated with the identified
                hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that while a management system deficiency
                currently exists, the Board did verify that risks are being
                evaluated and managed through established Environmental
                Protection program level practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance’s Environmental Protection program
                practices do not meet the OPR requirements with respect to
                process design and implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <h5>Management System Identifying Legal Requirements Process</h5>
              <p>
                As part of their demonstration, Alliance pointed the Board to
                their centralized compliance management system (CCMS) and the
                systems supporting documentation as their established and
                implemented documented process for identifying legal
                requirements. Upon review, the Board determined that these
                documents do not include the steps to how the legal requirements
                were identified but focused on how to use the CCMS. As a result,
                Alliance was unable to demonstrate that it has established and
                implemented a documented process to identify all legal
                requirements applicable to the company. The Board notes that
                while a management system process deficiency currently exists,
                the Board did confirm through interviews Alliance
                representatives that Alliance, with the support of a third party
                provider and internal subject matter expertise, did identify
                legal requirements that, in the opinion of Alliance, are
                applicable to the company. Please refer to the Management System
                Legal List below for additional details.

                Management System Monitoring Compliance with Legal Requirements
                Process
              </h5>
              <p>
                Similar to above, Alliance pointed to its CCMS documentation in
                order to demonstrate that it has established and implemented a
                process for monitoring compliance with its applicable legal
                requirements. Upon review, this documentation is focused on
                monitoring changes to legal requirements. While monitoring
                changes to legal requirements is one aspect of monitoring
                compliance and is required to be accounted for in the OPR’s
                management of change process, the Board notes that this is a
                reactive approach and does not proactively ensure that Alliance
                is in compliance with its current legal requirements (see
                Sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <em>Inspection, Measuring and Monitoring</em> for additional
                details). The Board notes that while a management system process
                deficiency currently exists, the Board did confirm through
                interviews with Alliance representatives and documentation
                review that Alliance is monitoring compliance with applicable
                legal requirements through several protection program level
                practices.

                Management System and Environmental Protection Program Legal
                List
              </h5>
              <p>
                As noted earlier, Alliance has developed a centralized
                electronic library, CCMS, in order to the meet the OPR
                requirements to establish and maintain a legal list.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, Alliance provided several demonstrations of
                this system and how it will be utilized to ensure Alliance
                remains in compliance with applicable legal requirements through
                various processes, procedures and practices. The Board verified
                that Alliance has established and maintained a legal list that
                includes all applicable federal and provincial requirements for
                the various protection programs included in this audit. However,
                Alliance’s legal list does not include referenced standards,
                with the most notable omission being the Canadian Standards
                Association (CSA) library of standards. During interviews,
                Alliance indicated that it is barred from incorporating any CSA
                standards content into its legal list due to CSA copyright
                restrictions. While the Board agrees that copyright restrictions
                may exist, they should not limit Alliance from listing the
                clause numbers of the specific provisions and not the actual
                text of the provisions. This alternative was discussed with
                Alliance during the audit with Alliance indicating that this
                would be unworkable for the following reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em
                    >Reliability and Usage Considerations &ndash; Since the
                    purpose is ultimately to ensure compliance, the legal list
                    must be easy to use and maintain. And above all else, it
                    must be reliable. In order to achieve these ends, Alliance
                    is of the view that the actual text of the requirements must
                    be set out explicitly. If users are required to continually
                    cross-reference the source document against the clause
                    numbers, errors will inevitably result, rendering the list
                    unreliable and possibly even creating a greater risk of
                    non-compliance.</em
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em
                    >Additional Challenges of Cross-Referencing &ndash; The need
                    to continually cross-reference would make auditing against
                    the requirements much more difficult and also raise
                    challenges in terms of keeping the list current.</em
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em
                    >Administrative Burden &ndash; Alliance secured the services
                    of a third party provider to extract the legal requirements
                    from the source document and enter them into their system on
                    Alliance’s behalf. In this case, copyright restrictions bar
                    Alliance from disclosing CSA standards to their third party
                    provider. Alliance would therefore have to bear the
                    administrative burden of extracting the clause numbers that
                    are associated with the legal requirements.</em
                  >
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Alliance also indicated that
                <em
                  >“it does not see any practical merit in replicating the
                  voluminous content of consensus standards in a legal list”</em
                >
                as company personnel have access to the standards and are fully
                cognizant on how these standards apply to the respective areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board agrees that the copyright restrictions may present a
                barrier from a development and maintenance perspective. However,
                it’s the Board opinion that having these applicable clauses
                listed, albeit in an abbreviation aspect, would achieve a higher
                probability of compliance versus relying solely on the company’s
                subject matter expertise. As a result, the Board has determined
                that Alliance has not demonstrated a legal list that meets the
                requirements of OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>h</em>).

              </h5>
              <p>
                Alliance’s EMS includes an element on legal and regulatory
                assessment of which Alliance has developed a documented practice
                that outlines the requirements to identify, record, and maintain
                environmental legal requirements. Several techniques are used to
                track, identify, and evaluate applicable laws and regulations,
                including commercial databases and periodicals, information from
                trade associations and direct communication with national and
                provincial/state regulatory agencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance demonstrated that it has accounted for the majority of
                its environmental legal requirements within its individual
                operating procedures. These legal requirements are being
                monitored and reviewed during its document management process.
                The Board reviewed these documents and associated records during
                the audit and found that Alliance had been implementing the
                practices as designed.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Alliance has established and implemented a documented
                practice at the Environmental Protection program level, this
                document does not meet the Board’s definition of a process as it
                does not include the Board’s common 5&nbsp;“w”s and&nbsp;“h”
                approach (who, what, where, when, why and how). Further to this,
                Alliance has developed an internal document hierarchy, which
                includes when a process (among other type of documents) should
                be developed and how it is defined. The Board reviewed this
                definition and determined that it does align with the Board’s
                expectations; however, it is not being used consistently in the
                organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the Environmental Protection program practice is
                focused on monitoring changes to legal requirements. While
                monitoring changes to legal requirements is one aspect on
                monitoring compliance required to be accounted for in the OPR’s
                management of change process, the Board notes that this is a
                reactive approach and does not proactively ensure that Alliance
                is in compliance with its current legal requirements (see
                Sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <em>Inspection, Measuring and Monitoring</em> for additional
                details)
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system and Environmental
                Protection program process for identifying and monitoring
                compliance with applicable legal requirements and thus is in
                non-compliance with OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>g</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has established and
                maintained a legal list that includes its federal and provincial
                requirements. However, this legal list does not include
                referenced standards and thus is in non-compliance with OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>h</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance’s Environmental Protection program
                practices does include the identification and monitoring changes
                to applicable environmental legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance’s Environmental Protection
                program practices do not meet the OPR requirements with respect
                to process design and implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <p>
                The company shall have an established, implemented and effective
                process for developing and setting goals, objectives and
                specific targets relevant to the risks and hazards associated
                with the company’s facilities and activities (i.e.,
                construction, operation and maintenance). The company’s process
                for setting objectives and specific targets shall ensure that
                the objectives and targets are those required to achieve its
                goals, and shall ensure that the objectives and targets are
                reviewed annually.
              </p>

                targets. The company shall annually review its performance in
                achieving its goals, objectives and targets and the performance
                of its management system. The company shall document the annual
                review of its performance, including the actions taken during
                the year to correct any deficiencies identified in its quality
                assurance program, in an annual report, signed by the
                accountable officer.

              <h4>Assessment:</h4>
              <h5>Management System Goals</h5>
              <p>
                The Board requires the company to document its policies and
                goals for ensuring its activities are conducted in a manner that
                ensures the safety and security of the public, workers and
                pipeline, and the protection of property and the environment.
                Through interviews and documentation review, Alliance
                demonstrated its senior leadership team has developed goals to
                meet the obligations referred to above. These goals are reviewed
                and reported upon during the quarterly and annual management
                review meetings.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the OPR specifically requires goals for the
                following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Prevention of ruptures;</li>
                <li>Prevention of liquid and gas releases;</li>
                <li>Prevention of fatalities and injuries; and</li>
                <li>Response to incidents and emergency situations.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                While Alliance has established documented goals for the
                prevention of ruptures, fatalities and injuries, its documented
                goals for the prevention of liquid and gas releases is limited
                to its pipeline right-of-way and does not include its
                aboveground facilities. As for goals for the response to
                incidents and emergency situations, Alliance did not develop a
                specific goal other than to track whether they had to respond to
                an incident or emergency situations. The Board expects that
                goals for these types of events should include, but not limited
                to, incident response times.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also notes that during the audit, Alliance was in the
                process of revising its management system to explicitly account
                for the OPR requirements. An updated framework was provided to
                the Board and while additional time is required to fully
                establish, implement and maintain its management system,
                Alliance was able to demonstrate that its management system is
                based upon the established goals referred to above and as
                required by OPR, section&nbsp;6.3(2).
              </p>
              <h5>Management System Objectives and Targets Process</h5>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, the process for developing objectives
                and targets was being completed at the various protection
                program levels and not by an established and implemented
                management system process as required by OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>a</em>). Alliance did demonstrate
                through its revised ORMS framework that it is in the process of
                developing an annual goals, objectives and target setting
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that while a management system deficiency
                currently exists, the Board did verify that objectives and
                targets are being identified through established practices. As
                demonstrated in its annual <em>Accountable Officer Report</em>,
                Alliance has established strategic management goals, objectives,
                measures and targets that are reviewed annually.
              </p>
              <h5>Management System Performance Measures</h5>
              <p>
                Alliance has developed performance measures for assessing the
                company’s success in achieving its goals, objectives, and
                targets and this was demonstrated in the company’s annual
                <em>Accountable Officer Report</em>.

              <p>
                Alliance’s EMS includes an element on objectives and targets of
                which Alliance has developed a documented practice that
                describes the steps that will be taken to establish objectives
                and targets focused on environmental stewardship and zero impact
                to the environment. At the Environmental Protection program
                level, objectives and targets are established through review and
                approval by the Health, Safety and Environment Management
                Committee (HSEMC). Once established, these objectives and
                targets are reviewed for performance on at a least a semi-annual
                basis with a final review being conducted in advance of
                preparing the Annual Accountable Officer Report. Through
                documentation review and interviews, the Board verified that
                these objectives and targets were appropriate for the
                Environmental Protection program and that the practice was being
                implemented as prescribed.

                In addition to the EMS objectives and targets, Alliance
                demonstrated through documentation and records that it conducts
                several other activities, both internal and external, to which
                the company was assessing the performance of its Environmental
                Protection program. These activities include the Operational
                Excellence Management System Report and NEB Performance
                Measures.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that while Alliance has established and
                implemented a documented practice at the Environmental
                Protection program level, this document does not meet the
                Board’s definition of a process as it does not include the
                Board’s common 5&nbsp;“w”s and&nbsp;“h” approach (who, what,
                where, when, why and how). Further to this, Alliance has
                developed an internal document hierarchy, which includes when a
                process (among other type of documents) should be developed and
                how it is defined. The Board reviewed this definition and
                determined that it does align with the Board expectations;
                however, it is not being used consistently in the organization.
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a management system and Environmental Protection
                program process for setting objectives and specific targets as
                required by the OPR. However, by practice, Alliance has
                developed management system and Environmental Protection program
                goals, objectives, and targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has developed goals for the
                prevention of ruptures, fatalities and injuries but has not
                developed goals for the response to incidents and emergency
                situations. The Board also found that Alliance goals for the
                prevention of liquid and gas releases is limited to its pipeline
                right-of-way and does not include its aboveground facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has based its management
                system and Environmental Protection program on these goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has established performance
                measures to assess the company’s success in achieving its goals,
                objectives and targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <h4>Expectations:</h4>
              <p>
                The company shall have a documented organizational structure
                that enables it to meet the requirements of its management
                system and its obligations to carry out activities in a manner
                that ensures the safety and security of the public, company
                employees and the pipeline, and protection of property and the
                environment. The documented structure shall enable the company
                to determine and communicate the roles, responsibilities and
                authority of the officers and employees at all levels. The
                company shall document contractors’ responsibilities in its
                construction and maintenance safety manuals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The documented organizational structure shall also enable the
                company to demonstrate that the human resources allocated to
                establishing, implementing and maintaining the management system
                are sufficient to meet the requirements of the management system
                and to meet the company’s obligations to design, construct,
                operate or abandon its facilities to ensure the safety and
                security of the public and the company’s employees, and the
                protection of property and the environment. The company shall
                complete an annual documented evaluation in order to demonstrate
                adequate human resourcing to meet these obligations.

                Management System Organizational Structure and Roles and
                Responsibilities
              </h5>
              <p>
                Through Alliance’s ORMS, a documented organizational structure
                has been established with the President and CEO designated as
                the Accountable Officer. The ORMS outlines some high level roles
                and responsibilities of positions within the management system
                and in more detail in job descriptions, accountability
                agreements, procedures, organizations and other management
                system documentation. Communication of roles and
                responsibilities occurs through policies, procedures, training
                and regular company and department communications. The Board has
                found the organizational structure is adequate for the
                management system, however, as Alliance continues to develop and
                implement the management system, regular review of the
                organizational structure needs to be performed.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the Board verified through record review that
                employees at all levels have
                <em>Accountability/Performance Agreements</em>. These agreements
                are completed annually, approved by both the employee and their
                leader, documents the employees roles and responsibilities and
                includes how each employee will support the organization in
                meeting its corporate goals.
              </p>
              <h5>Management System Annual Evaluation of Need</h5>
              <p>
                The ORMS outlines Alliance’s commitment to provide adequate
                resources to establish, implement, maintain and improve the
                management system. Formal review and planning primarily takes
                place through management review and the annual management review
                includes an evaluation of the need for changes including
                resource requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance demonstrated that it has developed a number of
                corporately required or supported mechanisms for evaluating its
                resourcing needs, including quarterly and annual meetings,
                progress reports and work completion reports. In addition,
                Alliance provided the Board a document entitled
                <em>Corporate Procedure / Assessment of Need Process</em> which
                explains the process that Alliance has undergone during 2013 and
                2014 to assess and rationalize its resource needs and shape its
                new organizational design. To demonstrate implementation of this
                process, Alliance also provided a document entitled
                <em
                  >Corporate Procedure / Assessment of Need Process &ndash;
                  Findings</em
                >
                that provided the essential results of the assessment undertaken
                during 2013 and 2014. Upon review of these records, the Board
                found that Alliance has not demonstrated an annual documented
                evaluation of need that meets the OPR requirements as these
                records were exception based and thus the Board could not attest
                to the comprehensiveness of this review.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also reminds Alliance that the annual evaluation of
                need has to ensure that resources are sufficient to establish,
                implement and maintain the management system in order to meet
                Alliance’s obligations to protect the safety and security of the
                people, the pipeline and for the protection of the environment.
                As a result, this evaluation must account for all the activities
                as well as those employees or other persons working with or on
                behalf of the company who enable Alliance to meet those
                requirements.

                Environmental Protection Program Organizational Structure and
                Roles and Responsibilities
              </h5>
              <p>
                Alliance’s EMS has an element on leadership, structure and
                responsibility, which provides a description of commitments and
                approach to organizational structure. Specifically, this element
                describes roles and responsibilities for the following groups or
                individuals:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Accountable Officer;</li>
                <li>
                  Board of Directors Health, Safety, and Environment Committee;

                <li>
                  Health, Safety and Environment Management Committee (HSEMC);
                </li>
                <li>Director, Health, Safety, and Environment;</li>
                <li>Environment Department; and</li>
                <li>Employee-Partners.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Alliance’s EMS also refers to job descriptions, procedures and
                other management system documentation as providing further
                specific roles and responsibilities. The Board verified that
                additional roles and responsibilities for the area management
                and employee partners are outlined in environmental practices.
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has a documented organizational
                structure and communicates the roles, responsibilities and
                authorities of the officers and employees at all levels of the
                company.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance did not demonstrate that the
                human resources allocated to establishing, implementing and
                maintaining its management system are sufficient to meet the
                requirements of the management system and to meet the company’s
                obligations under OPR, section&nbsp;6.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <p>
                At the time of the audit, the evaluation and managing of risks
                for normal operations was being primarily completed at the
                various protection program levels and not by an established and
                implemented management system process as required by OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>e</em>). Similarly, the development and
                implementation of controls and communicating those controls to
                those who are exposed to the risks were also being completed at
                the various protection program levels and not by an established
                and implemented management system process. Alliance demonstrated
                that through its revised ORMS framework that it is in the
                process of developing a risk assessment and control process. The
                Board notes that while a management system deficiency currently
                exists, the Board did verify that hazards and risks are being
                controlled through established protection program level
                practices.

              <p>
                The ORMS is comprised of several different mechanisms for
                coordinating and controlling the operational activities and
                other people working with or on behalf of the company. A review
                of the ORMS indicated that a formal organizational structure has
                been established and roles, responsibilities, accountabilities
                and authorities are detailed in job descriptions, accountability
                agreements, procedures, organizational charts and other
                management system documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance indicated that these requirements were further
                described within its

                on the management of the physical and financial performance of
                operational assets and do not ensure that all operational
                activities are being coordinating and controlled. As one
                example, aboveground facility and pipeline right-of-way
                inspections that are conducted by the protection programs would
                not be accounted in the practices currently established by
                Alliance. Alliance is therefore non-compliant with OPR,

                  Alliance’s EMS includes an element on operational control,
                  which outlines the requirements to ensure environmental
                  impacts associated with activities are mitigated and
                  controlled through operational control procedures. Alliance
                  has established and implemented a practice that outlines the

                <p>
                  Through documentation review and interviews, the Board found
                  that Alliance has developed and implemented controls at the
                  Environmental Protection program level to account for the
                  identified hazards and risks as noted in Sub-element&nbsp;2.1.
                  These controls included procedures for waste management,
                  management of clubroot, vegetation management and air quality
                  monitoring. However, the Board notes the following
                  deficiencies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Alliance has developed a Canadian Reclamation Procedure that
                    has been in draft format since 7&nbsp;January 2011. Of note,
                    this procedure lists the steps to take if possible
                    reclamation issues are identified by a landowner, aerial
                    patrol, etc. However, this procedure is owned by Alliance’s
                    Land, Right of Way and Corridor Management team with no
                    formal link to Alliance’s Environmental Department;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Alliance’s existing practices do not account for when
                    project specific Environmental Protection Plans will be
                    developed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While Alliance has established and implemented a documented
                    practice at the Environmental Protection program level, this
                    document does not meet the Board’s definition of a process
                    as it does not include the Board’s common 5&nbsp;“w”s
                    and&nbsp;“h” approach (who, what, where, when, why and how).
                    Further to this, Alliance has developed an internal document
                    hierarchy, which includes when a process (among other type
                    of documents) should be developed and how it is defined. The
                    Board reviewed this definition and determined that it does
                    align with the Board expectations; however, it is not being
                    used consistently in the organization; and

                    Alliance could not demonstrate that it has communicated its
                    environmental controls to those who may be exposed to the
                    risks, most notably being Alliance’s operational staff.

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board found that, at the Environmental Protection program
                  level, Alliance has developed and implemented controls for the
                  identified hazard and risks. However, Alliance could not
                  demonstrate that it has communicated these controls to those
                  who may be exposed to the risks, most notably being their
                  operational staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board also found that Alliance has not established and
                  implemented a documented management system process for
                  developing and implementing controls and thus is in
                  non-compliance with OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>f</em>).

                <p>
                  The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                  maintained a documented management system process for

                  employees or other people working with or on behalf of the

              </h5>
              <p>
                In its ORMS framework, Alliance has developed an element that is
                focused on Operational Control &ndash; Upset or Abnormal
                Conditions and references the Emergency Management Program as
                providing the framework and overview of the processes to
                identify risks, prevent, mitigate, prepare for, respond to and
                recover from emergency situations. The Board notes that Alliance
                has developed several contingency plans such as the
                <em>Pandemic Preparedness Plan</em> and
                <em>Corporate/Departmental Business Continuity Plans</em>.
                However, Alliance was not able to demonstrate that it has
                established and implemented a documented management system
                process for developing contingency plans for abnormal events
                that may occur during construction, operation, maintenance,
                abandonment or emergency situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that contingency plans are not limited to
                emergency response. Therefore, the Board found that Alliance’s
                management system did not include specific processes or policies
                for developing contingency plans for abnormal events.

                Review of Alliance’s documents and records, as well as
                interviews with Alliance representatives indicated that the
                company was able to demonstrate that it has appropriate controls

                In particular, Alliance has established and implemented an
                Environmental Protection program practice specifically for
                responding to releases. Additionally, the Board also found that
                Alliance frontline staff, including managers, has received
                various levels of <em>Integrated Command Structure</em> (ICS)
                and first response training needed to fulfill their anticipated

                requirements. However, interviews with regional personnel
                confirmed that Alliance regional staff use and understand the

                developing controls (Sub-element&nbsp;3.1
                <em>Operational Control &ndash; Normal Operations</em> above), 
                Alliance has developed controls that address its identified
                environmental hazards and risks relating to upset and abnormal
                operating conditions.

                The Board also found that Alliance had not established a

                During the audit, Alliance demonstrated that it has developed
                several standards, procedures, and processes for managing change

                  changes at the operational level (i.e. changes to assets,
                  procedures, etc.) are assessed.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition and as listed in its ORMS framework provided to the
                Board, Alliance has indicated that it will be developing a
                <em>Corporate Management of Change</em> process that is still
                being formalized.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documentation review and interviews, the Board has
                determined that Alliance has not met the requirements of OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(<em>i</em>) for the following reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The aforementioned standards, procedures and processes
                  function independently of one another and thus are not
                  systematic;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Changes to organizational structure are not accounted for in
                  these standards, procedures and processes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While the <em>Field Operations MOC Process</em> is adequately
                  designed, Alliance could not demonstrate that it is being
                  consistently implemented as prescribed.<br />
                  As one example, the process requires that environmental
                  checklists are to be completed for every asset based change.
                  Records reviewed during the audit did not contain these
                  checklists.

              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the OPR requires a company to develop a
                management system MOC process that identifies and manages any
                change that could affect safety, security or the protection of
                the environment. Further the Board notes that, while a company
                may have multiple processes, there still must be consistency in
                process requirements, development and implementation as well as
                coordination of the various practices in order to meet the OPR
                requirements and to ensure formal management..

                which Alliance has developed a documented practice to ensure
                that changes to plans, practices, procedures and processes are
                adequately vetted with stakeholders and to document the efforts
                conducted during the change process. Upon review, the Board
                notes that this practice does not account for all the changes

                While Alliance has established a documented process at the
                Environmental Protection program level, this document does not
                meet the Board’s definition of a process as it does not include

              <p>
                Alliance has developed a
                <em>Learning and Development Management System</em> that applies
                to the entire Alliance organization and consists of the
                following five&nbsp;programs: Onboarding, Training, Competency,
                Performance Support and Leadership. To administer training and
                competency evaluation, Alliance utilizes an additional system
                referred to as the <em>Online Learning Environment</em> (OLE).
                The system provides the mechanism to register, deliver, track
                and record learning completions. The OLE also contains
                requirements for onboarding, training and operations competency
                that includes skills, knowledge and attributes that an
                employee-partner needs in order to be considered qualified or
                capable of performing a specific task. Supporting OLE is an
                <em>Alliance Competency Evaluation</em> (ACE) program and
                competency evaluation process that is intended to ensure field
                maintenance technicians are trained and competent to perform
                their daily tasks in a safe and effective manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing the provided documentation as well as through
                interviews, the Board notes the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alliance has not established and implemented a process for
                  developing competencies and training programs as required by
                  the OPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alliance has developed a training program as per the
                  requirements of OPR, section&nbsp;46; However, there are
                  certain environmental practices and procedures, such as
                  vegetation management, of which a one-time only training
                  session was provided. As ensuring adequate vegetation
                  management at Alliance’s aboveground facilities and pipeline
                  right-of-way would be considered a core environmental activity
                  for Alliance’s operation staff, the Board found that a
                  one-time training session would not be sufficient.
                  Additionally, the identification of potential reclamation and
                  vegetation management issues and implementation of corrective
                  actions are being completed by Alliance representatives who
                  have not received any formal training on these matters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Through the ACE program, Alliance has developed competencies
                  for its field maintenance technicians. However, this is
                  limited to matters of safety. While the Board recognizes this
                  importance, competencies should also be developed for those
                  tasks that involve environmental and emergency management
                  considerations;
                </li>
                <li>
                  OLE programs apply to Alliance employees but not to all
                  workers doing activities on behalf of the company. Alliance
                  does manage contractors through a third party prequalification
                  process and a field orientation course. However, this is not
                  accounted for by a management system process; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alliance’s training department provides support to all
                  protection programs for the development of departmental
                  content and eLearning programs and each department manages the
                  content of programs housed in OLE. The Board verified through
                  front line interviews and inspections that Alliance has
                  implemented the systems to generate, manage and document the
                  various training programs.

              </h5>
              <p>
                Through interviews and documentation review, the Board found
                that Alliance has established and implemented a documented
                management system process to verify that certain employees are
                trained and competent through its ACE program. However, as it
                indicated in the previous section, the ACE program is limited to
                field maintenance technicians and does not include other
                employees or other persons working with or on behalf of the
                company. As a result, the Board found Alliance in non-compliance
                with the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board verified that all formal training within the OLE
                includes records of training, which are maintained for all
                training and other activities provided. During the site visits
                and interviews at each location, the Board was shown updated
                data on outstanding and scheduled training for the local
                employees. The Board verified that all training was up to date.

                to how this requirement was being met. However, Alliance could
                not demonstrate that it has established and implemented a
                documented management system and Environmental Protection
                program process that makes employees and other persons working
                with or on behalf of the company aware of their

              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance has not established and

                competencies for its field maintenance technicians. However,
                these competencies are limited to matters of safety and do not
                include environmental protection and emergency management

                During the audit, Alliance demonstrated that it effectively
                communicates information relating to safety, security and
                protection of environment to both internal and external
                stakeholders. Mechanisms that demonstrated this included its
                internal intranet site, various daily, weekly, monthly and
                annual meetings and the development of communication plans for
                each of the protection programs included in this audit. However,
                Alliance was not able to demonstrate that it has established and
                implemented a documented process that accounts for all of these
                activities. The Board notes that during the audit, Alliance was
                in the process of revising its management system to explicitly
                account for the OPR requirements and this includes developing a
                management system communication process.

                external communication regarding environmental matters. It also
                describes ‘communication management’ as including all personnel
                under the control of the organization including temporary
                employees, contractors, sub-contractors, relevant vendors,

              <p>
                As part of its demonstration, Alliance pointed the Board to its
                CCMS and the systems supporting documentation as its established
                and implemented process for identifying the documents
                requir<em>n</em>ed for the company to meet its obligations under
                OPR, section&nbsp;6. Upon review, the Board determined that
                these documents do not include the steps to determine what types
                of documents are required but focuses on how to use the CCMS. As
                a result, Alliance was unable to demonstrate that it has

                While Alliance’s process does stipulate that the reviews of
                documents are to occur, it does not define a revision schedule.
                The Board notes that all documents provided during the audit
                were current based on normal, acceptable industry best
                practices. However, to ensure that documents remain current in
                the future, the Board requires that a defined revision schedule
                be incorporated into this process.

                required for the company to meet its obligations under OPR
                section&nbsp;6 and thus is in non-compliance with OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>n</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has developed documents that would
                be typically expected for a company of its size and to the
                scope, nature and complexity of its activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <p>
                At the time of the audit, the inspection and monitoring of the
                company’s activities and facilities was being completed at the
                various protection program levels and not by an established and
                implemented management system process as required by OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>u</em>). Alliance did demonstrate
                through its revised ORMS framework that it is in the process of
                developing an inspection process. The Board notes that while a
                management system deficiency currently exists, the Board did
                verify that inspections are being completed through established
                program level practices.

                Monitoring Compliance and Inspecting to Legal Requirements
              </h5>
              <p>
                As referred to Sub-element&nbsp;2.2, Alliance was not able to
                demonstrate that it has established and implemented a management
                system process to monitor compliance with applicable legal
                requirements as documentation provided focused on changes to
                legal requirements. In addition, OPR section&nbsp;53 requires
                companies to conduct inspections on a regular basis to ensure
                compliance with certain parts of the NEB Act, the OPR and the
                terms and conditions of any certificate or order issued by the
                Board, as they relate to the protection of property, the
                environment and the safety of the public and of the company’s
                employees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through documentation review and interviews, Alliance was not
                able to demonstrate that these inspections were occurring as
                required.

                At the time of the audit, taking corrective and preventive
                actions if deficiencies are identified through inspections was
                being completed at the various protection program levels and not
                by an established and implemented management system process as
                required by OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>u</em>). The Board
                notes that while a management system deficiency currently
                exists, the Board did verify that corrective and preventive
                actions resulting from inspections are being completed through
                established program level practices.

              <h5>Surveillance and Monitoring Program</h5>
              <p>
                The OPR requires companies to develop and implement surveillance
                and monitoring program. During its audit the Board identified
                that Alliance undertakes numerous types and a high number of
                monitoring and surveillance activities of its regulated
                facilities. The Board found, however, that the amalgamation of
                activities do not meet the OPR section&nbsp;39 program
                requirements with respect to design and management. The Board
                has included its program requirements with Section&nbsp;1.0
                Audit Terminology and Definitions in the attached audit report.

              </h5>
              <p>
                Alliance’s EMS has an element on inspections which provides an
                overview on Alliance’s approach to conducting inspections as it
                pertains to the Environmental Protection program. The Board
                notes that Alliance has also established and implemented an
                Environmental Protection program practice to inspect its
                facilities. Topics inspected during these inspections include,
                but not limited to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Waste management;</li>
                <li>Sensitive resources protection;</li>
                <li>Air quality; and</li>
                <li>Surface and groundwater protection.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, the Board verified through interviews and
                documentation review that several other types of Environmental
                Protection program level inspections were also being conducted,
                including the monthly Field Operations Work Order Task,
                Semi-Annual Mainline Compressor, Area Management Inspections and
                Geohazard Management Program. However, these activities were not
                being completed as part of an established Environmental
                Protection program process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found the following regarding Alliance’s
                Environmental Protection program inspection practice:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Inspections are limited to aboveground facilities and do not
                  have a prescribed frequency to how often these facilities
                  should be inspected;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inspections do not include Alliance’s pipeline right-of-way;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Follow up inspections to confirm reclamation success for
                  ground disturbance activities are not consistently being
                  conducted.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Of note, Board inspections conducted in conjunction with this
                audit identified several issues relating to invasive plant
                management. The Board concludes that the issues identified in
                the Board’s inspections could be considered routine or standard
                practice issues, which had been on-going for some time and
                should have been identified by an adequate company inspection
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Alliance has established a documented process at the
                Environmental Protection program level, this document does not
                meet the Board’s definition of a process as it does not include
                the Board’s common 5&nbsp;“w”s and&nbsp;“h” approach (who, what,
                where, when, why and how).
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system process for
                inspecting and monitoring the company’s activities and
                facilities to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the
                Environmental Protection program as required by the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance did not demonstrate that it
                was inspecting to its legal requirements as required by the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance was taking corrective and
                preventive actions for the deficiencies identified through its
                Environmental Protection program inspections.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance’s Environmental Protection
                program practices do not meet the OPR requirements with respect
                to process design and implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance had not developed
                surveillance and monitoring program that meets the requirement
                of OPR section&nbsp;39.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

                Through documentation review and interviews, Alliance was able
                to demonstrate that it has established and maintained a data
                management system through an internal software application. This
                application is managed and maintained at the corporate level and

                identify and manage the training and competency requirements for
                staff carrying out the audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company should integrate the results of its audits with
                other data in hazard identification and analysis, risk
                assessment, performance measures and annual management review,
                to ensure continual improvement in meeting the company’s
                obligations for safety, security and protection of the
                environment.

                Assurance Program
              </h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, Alliance pointed to their
                <em>Accountable Officer Report Process</em> and to the
                activities listed within the
                <em>Annual Accountable Officer Repor</em>t as evidence to
                demonstrate it has established and implemented a quality
                assurance program for its management system and Environmental
                Protection program. The Board has found, however, that
                Alliance’s interpretation of a Quality Assurance Program is
                incorrect. The Board has provided clear guidance as part of the
                guidance notes that accompany the OPR that a program is not
                simply a description of activities. Programs are: ”a documented
                set of processes and procedures designed to regularly accomplish
                a result. A program outlines how plans, processes and procedures
                are linked, and how each one contributes toward the result.
                Program planning and evaluation are conducted regularly to check
                that the program is achieving intended results.” The Board’s
                definition is included in
                <em>Section&nbsp;1.0 Audit Terminology and Definitions</em> of
                the attached audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that while a management system and Environmental
                Protection program deficiency currently exists, the Board did
                verify that quality assurance activities are occurring at the
                management system and Environmental Protection program level.
              </p>
              <h5>Management System Audit Process</h5>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, the process of conducting audits in
                accordance with section&nbsp;53 and for taking corrective and
                preventive actions if deficiencies are identified was being
                completed at the various protection program levels and not by an
                established and implemented management system process as
                required by OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>w</em>). Alliance did
                demonstrate through its revised ORMS framework that it is in the
                process of developing an audit process.
              </p>
              <h5>Environmental Protection Program Audit Process</h5>
              <p>
                At the Environmental Protection program level, Alliance did not
                demonstrate that it had established and implemented a process to
                conduct audits as required. However, Alliance did conduct an
                audit of its EMS in 2014. The Board notes that while these
                audits could assess some of Alliance’s legal requirements as it
                pertains to the Environmental Protection program, it would not
                account for all of the legal requirements as required in OPR,
                section&nbsp;53.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, the audit conducted in 2014 was limited to a
                conformance review of internal processes, practices, and
                procedures and did not include any field verification activities
                to confirm that the Environmental Protection program would be
                effective as required by OPR, section&nbsp;55.
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance was undertaking many of the
                activities that are normally associated with a quality assurance
                program. The Board found, however, that Alliance had not
                organized them within a program as required by the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system and Environmental
                Protection program process for conducting audits in accordance
                with section&nbsp;53 of the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance was not able to demonstrate that
                it has undertaken audits consistent with OPR sections&nbsp;53
                and&nbsp;55 requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

                The company shall have an established, implemented and effective
                process for generating, retaining, and maintaining records that
                document the implementation of the management system and its
                protection programs, and for providing access to those who

              <p>
                To demonstrate its compliance with OPR
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>p</em>), Alliance provided the following
                documents:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Record and Information Management Policy</em>;</li>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board found that while the specific OPR process requirements
                to generate, retain and maintain records to document the
                implementation of the management system and the protection
                programs could be accounted for by reviewing these documents in
                their totality, the Board requires that a singular management
                system process be established and implemented to ensure ease of
                use and understanding among company employees. Further, Alliance
                has developed an internal document hierarchy, which includes
                when processes (among other type of documents) should be
                developed and how these documents are defined. The Board
                reviewed this definition and it determined that it does align
                with the Board expectations; however, it is not being used
                consistently in the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the management system and Environmental Protection
                program process deficiency, Alliance was able to demonstrate
                that records documenting the implementation of the Environmental
                Protection program were being generated, retained and
                maintained. Examples provided to the Board included records
                verifying training, inspections, and the completion of
                corrective actions.
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had implemented consistent records
                management practices to document the implementation of its
                management system and Environmental Protection program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has not established and

                      level, which does not ensure performance at the protection
                      program level;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Review of the management system is not part of this

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Department level objectives and key measures within this
                      review process do not align with the management system
                      goals, objectives and targets established through
                      Alliance’s practice as referred to in Sub-element&nbsp;2.3
                      of this audit report.
                    </li>

                  <em>EMS Management Review and Improvement Practice</em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      As prescribed, this practice is intended to describe how
                      the HSMEC will conduct the review of the Environmental
                      Protection program;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The practice also states these reviews are to be conducted
                      quarterly and thus meets the frequency requirements of the
                      OPR;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This practice is not integrated by process to either the
                      <em>Accountable Officer Report Process</em> and OEMS
                      <em>Management Review Process</em> referred to above; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This practice does not meet the Board’s definition of a
                      process as it does not include the Board’s common
                      5&nbsp;w’s and&nbsp;h approach (who, what, where, when,
                      why and how). Further, Alliance has a developed an
                      internal document hierarchy, which includes when a process
                      (among other type of documents) should be developed and
                      how it is defined. The Board reviewed this definition and
                      it determined that it does align with the Board
                      expectations; however, it is not being used consistently
                      in the organization.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>HSMEC Committee Meetings</em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Records provided to the Board from 2013 to date have
                      demonstrated that these meetings have occurred quarterly;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The meetings include a review of incidents, performance of
                      goals, objectives and targets as well as staff resourcing;
                      and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This activity is not integrated by process to either the
                      <em>Accountable Officer Report Process</em> and
                      <em>OEMS Management Review Process</em> referred to above.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In summary, the Board notes that Alliance is conducting several
                activities to review its management system and Environmental
                Protection program. However, these activities are not integrated
                and thus do not meet the Board’s management system and
                Environmental Protection program process requirements. Alliance
                will have to develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h5>Management System Evaluation Process</h5>
              <p>
                While the Board has listed this requirement under
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1 of the Protocol, Alliance indicated during
                the audit that its
                <em>Accountable Officers Report Process</em> is also used to
                evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the company’s
                management system. In reviewing the content of this process and
                as set out above the Board notes the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  At the time of the audit, the process was not established as
                  per the Board’s working definition as the document was
                  approved in June 2015. However, interviews confirmed it was
                  implemented by practice in order to prepare the 2014
                  <em>Accountable Officer Repor</em>t;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The design of the process meets Board’s working definition as
                  it includes the Board’s common 5&nbsp;w’s and&nbsp;h approach
                  (who, what, where, when, why and how); and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Process does not explicitly indicate how the adequacy and
                  effectiveness of the company’s management system is evaluated
                  and this would need to be inferred through several activities
                  within the process.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a process for evaluating the adequacy and
                effectiveness of its management system. Alliance will have to
                develop corrective actions to address the described
                deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h5>Annual Report</h5>
              <p>
                According to OPR section&nbsp;6.6, Alliance must complete its
                annual <em>Accountable Officer Report</em>, have it signed by
                the accountable officer, and submit confirmation of completion
                to the Board no later than April&nbsp;30 each year. The Board
                confirmed that the <em>Accountable Officer Report</em> for the
                2014 performance year was signed by the accountable officer and
                confirmation of completion was submitted to the Board on
                April&nbsp;17, 2015.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance develops an annual
                <em>Accountable Officer Report</em> that summarizes the
                performance of its OEMS and supporting protection programs.
                Alliance divides the report into five&nbsp;main parts:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Overview of protection programs and managements;</li>
                <li>
                  Performance management: management system goals and results;
                </li>
                <li>Quality assurance;</li>
                <li>
                  Progress against the previous year’s improvement
                  recommendations; and
                </li>
                <li>Recommendations for the coming year.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Upon review of the annual <em>Accountable Officer Report</em>,
                the Board noted that the report does describe the performance of
                the company’s management system in meeting its obligations to
                ensure the safety and security of the people, the pipeline and
                the protection of the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the report also describes the company’s achievement
                of its established goals, objectives and targets. The annual
                <em>Accountable Officer Report</em> also includes a section that
                describes the quality assurance activities that occurred in that
                year. However, Alliance’s annual
                <em>Accountable Officer Repor</em>t does not specify the actions
                taken during that year to correct any deficiencies identified by
                the quality assurance program. Thus, it is unclear whether the
                accountable officer is aware of these actions and deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h5>Management Responsibility</h5>
              <p>
                Further to the review of these processes and activities, the
                Board notes that Alliance has not conducted audits consistent
                with its OPR obligations. The Board views the responsibility for
                undertaking these audits as resting with the company’s senior
                management (as represented by its accountable officer) as the
                annual report developed as per OPR specifically requires review
                and reporting on aspects of the Quality Assurance Program
                (specifically including audits) and the performance of the
                management system in meeting its obligations under OPR
                section&nbsp;6.
              </p>
              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had developed processes for and
                undertaken activities relating to its Management Review
                responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance’s processes did not meet all
                of the requirements outlined in the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that some of the Non-Compliant findings in
                this audit are related to sub-elements where Alliance’s Senior
                Management has responsibilities to ensure that management
                direction, oversight and formal monitoring are occurring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Environmental Protection program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.
              </p>

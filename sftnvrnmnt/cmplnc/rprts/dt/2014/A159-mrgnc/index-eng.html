              </p>
              <p>
                The National Energy Board has completed its Final Audit Report
                for its audit of Alliance’s Emergency Management Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                A draft report documenting the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s
                Emergency Management Program was provided to Alliance on
                23&nbsp;February 2016 for review and comment. On 17&nbsp;March
                2016, Alliance submitted its response.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has considered Alliance’s comments and has made
                changes to the Final Audit Report and its Appendices as it
                determined to be appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of
                whether Alliance was compliant with the regulatory requirements
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alliance’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Alliance was required to demonstrate the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the methods selected and employed within its
                Programs to meet the regulatory requirements listed above.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has enclosed the Final Audit Report and associated
                appendices with this letter. The Board will make the Final Audit
                Report and Appendices public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance is required to file a Corrective Action Plan (CAP),
                which describes the methods and timing for addressing the
                Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for
                approval by the Board prior to <strong>2&nbsp;May 2016</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the CAP public and will continue to monitor
                and assess all of Alliance’s corrective actions with respect to
                this audit until they are fully implemented. The Board will also
                continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                Alliance’s Emergency Management Program and management system
                through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of
                its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and environmental protection.
                Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to
                incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations. These systems and
                associated technical management programs include the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure NEB regulated
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. In the public
                interest, the Board holds companies accountable for safety and
                environmental outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s comprehensive audit of
                Alliance’s management system and Emergency Management program
                applicable to its facilities that are regulated by the NEB. The
                audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. This amendment clarified
                the Board’s expectations for establishing and implementing a
                documented management system and Emergency Management program.
                Before issuing the amendment, the Board consulted and
                communicated with its regulated companies with respect to the
                new requirements; therefore, an implementation grace period was
                not given when the OPR was promulgated. As a result, when
                evaluating compliance, this audit did not consider any extra
                time Alliance may have needed to implement changes associated
                with the formalized management system requirements. As indicated
                in the amendments, companies must have an effective and
                well-documented Emergency Management program as a key component
                of their management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published audit
                protocol, which identifies five&nbsp;management system elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
                regulatory requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a
                company’s program is found to be deficient with respect to any
                regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element will be found
                Non-Compliant. This report also includes an assessment of
                Alliance’s management system against the requirements of OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Alliance’s regulated facilities found that
                Alliance is in the process of establishing and implementing an
                operational management system that will account for all of the
                technical programs required by the Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that Alliance’s records indicate that an
                <em>Operational Excellence Management System</em> (OEMS) was
                implemented in 2008 for the purpose of creating a structured
                platform for the ongoing identification and active discussion of
                operational risks. Since then, quarterly OEMS management review
                meetings have been held to which discussions on current risks,
                operational matters and regulatory updates are discussed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance’s records also indicated that an internal evaluation of
                OEMS was conducted in 2012, which resulted in a new iteration of
                Alliance’s management system that is being rebranded as the
                <em>Operational Risk Management System</em> (ORMS). Alliance
                indicated that ORMS is
                <em
                  >“designed to be an overarching, integrated framework of
                  vision, policies, standards, programs and governance processes
                  to be used by the company in working towards meeting its
                  corporate objectives of “zero safety, pipeline or
                  environmental incidents and compliant, ethical and good
                  neighbor wherever we operate”</em
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of when Alliance started its management system
                development, the Board identified that Alliance’s management
                system is in a transitory state between the program-based
                management practices it used in the past and its new management
                system approach. This has contributed to a Non-Compliant finding
                related to establishing and implementing a compliant management
                system. It is important to understand that the Board’s finding
                regarding Alliance’s management system primarily reflects the
                company’s stage in developing and applying its management
                system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of technical
                management activities being undertaken to ensure the safety of
                the pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Alliance’s management system included an
                assessment of the individual management system processes as
                described in the OPR and the Board’s audit protocol. As
                documented in this report, the Board found that Alliance has
                documented some of the required processes within its
                <em>Operational Risk Management System</em>. However, the Board
                found that most of Alliance’s management system processes were
                not sufficiently systematic, explicit, comprehensive and
                proactive to meet the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that, regardless of the reasons for
                non-compliance, companies were required to be compliant with the
                Board’s management system requirements when the OPR were updated
                in 2013. Alliance will need to develop and implement corrective
                actions to ensure establishment and implementation of its
                management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to evaluating Alliance’s management system and
                associated processes, the Board’s audit also included an
                evaluation of Alliance’s Emergency Management program to
                determine the applicability and integration of the management
                system within it and to assess whether Alliance is meeting its
                requirements to develop, implement and maintain an Emergency
                Management program that anticipates, prevents, manages and
                mitigates conditions during an emergency that could adversely
                affect property, the environment or the safety of workers or the
                public. The Board found that, notwithstanding the documentation
                issues relating to its management system processes, the
                processes and practices presently used by Alliance identified
                the majority, and most significant, of its emergency management
                related hazards and that Alliance has developed and implemented
                operational controls and inspection and monitoring programs to
                address these hazards. The Board notes that Alliance’s Emergency
                Management program has been in existence for many years, thus
                its related practices and procedures are well established within
                the organization. The Board did identify some deficiencies not
                related to management system process development. All of the
                Board’s findings are documented in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/A159-mrgnc/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a

                of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                In analyzing the results of its audit as a whole, the Board
                notes that it has made a significant number of Non-Compliant
                findings. The majority of these findings fall into three general
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Alliance’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the majority of all of the Non-Compliant
                findings made by the Board relate to management system process
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that enforcement actions are not
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Alliance must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval. The Corrective Action
                Plan must detail how Alliance intends to resolve the
                non-compliances identified by this audit. The Board will assess
                implementation of the corrective actions to confirm they are
                completed in a timely manner and applied consistently across
                Alliance’s regulated system. The Board will also continue to

              <p>
                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses
                the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains
                the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent
                basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented,
                meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.

              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements
                of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> and its associated
                regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained
                on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others
                working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the
                process or other requirement. Records and interviews have
                provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as
                prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially
                utilized).

              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5 (1)(<em>o</em>). With records, the
                company must demonstrate that it meets the records management

                designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote

                structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and
                procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations
                related to safety, security and Emergency Management.

                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must

                  >OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) describes the Board’s required
                  management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                  management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                  process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                  developed or maintained as described within each section;
                  whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                  designed to address the requirements of the process, for
                  example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards
                  and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit
                  required actions including roles, responsibilities and
                  authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing
                  the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common
                  5&nbsp;w’s and h&nbsp;approach (who, what, where, when, why
                  and how). The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have
                  multiple requirements; companies may therefore establish and
                  implement multiple processes, as long as they are designed to
                  meet the legal requirements and integrate any processes
                  linkages contemplated by the OPR section. Processes must
                  incorporate or contain linkage to procedures, where required
                  to meet the process requirements.</em

                  cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as
                  long as they meet the process requirements (as described
                  above) and direct the program processes to be established and

              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection and efficient energy infrastructure and
                markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set
                by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy development
                and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are designed,
                constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that ensures:
                the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection
                of the environment, the Board has developed regulations
                requiring companies to establish and implement documented
                management systems applicable to specified technical management
                and protection programs. These management systems and programs
                must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the
                NEB Act and its associated regulations. The Board’s management
                system requirements are described within OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1
                through&nbsp;6.6.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the audit, the Board reviews the compliance and
                incident history of the company as recorded in NEB files. This
                helps the Board determine the appropriate scope for the audit.
                During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and samples
                records provided by the company in its demonstration of
                compliance and interviews corporate and regionally-based staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also conducts separate but linked technical
                inspections of a representative sample of company facilities.
                This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness
                and implementation of the management system and programs. The
                Board bases the scope and location of the inspections on the
                needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard
                inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the
                audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If
                unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an
                inspection, they are actioned as set out by the Board’s standard
                inspection and enforcement practices.stem and programs,
                identifies deficiencies and communicates compliance findings.
                The Final Audit Report follows the format of the Board’s
                published Audit Protocol. Once the Board issues the Final Audit
                Report, the company must submit and implement a Corrective
                Action Plan to address all Non-Compliant findings. Final Audit
                Reports are published on the Board’s website. The audit results
                are integrated into NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to
                compliance assurance.

              <p>
                Alliance operates approximately 1,600&nbsp;km of pipeline in
                three Canadian provinces. These pipeline facilities include
                mainline and lateral compressor stations, mainline block valves
                and associated operational assets. All of these facilities are
                within the definition of a “pipeline” as included in the NEB
                Act. Alliance also has a considerable amount of infrastructure
                in the United States, which completes its North American system.
                Alliance’s system allows it to transport rich natural gas from
                the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and the Williston Basin
                to end-users in the United States Midwest and other downstream
                markets. In order for Alliance to operate its pipelines
                effectively, it has developed a management structure that
                reflects its safety and security management, and environmental
                obligations, as well as its corporate, national, and regional
                needs.

              <p>
                During audit planning, company staff indicated that Alliance
                operates its pipelines and facilities using a common management
                system and technical programs. In order to effectively evaluate
                compliance of such an expansive system within a reasonable
                timeframe, the Board chose to conduct individual, comprehensive
                audits of Alliance’s required technical programs and management
                system. This report documents one of five&nbsp;management system
                and program audits. The audits are titled:

                Audit results confirmed that Alliance operates its facilities
                using a common organizational structure to implement a common
                governance management system that applies to all of its business
                and operational activities. Some findings are therefore similar
                in each audit and the individual audit reports reflect this.

              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to determine the establishment
                and implementation of Alliance’s management system and the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its Emergency Management program.
                Alliance was audited against the requirements contained within
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alliance’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. This amendment clarified
                the Board’s expectations for establishing and implementing a
                documented management system and Emergency Management program.
                Before issuing the amendment, the Board consulted and
                communicated with its regulated companies with respect to the
                new requirements; therefore, an implementation grace period was
                not given when the OPR was promulgated. As a result, when
                evaluating compliance, this audit did not consider any extra
                time Alliance may have needed to implement changes.

              <p>
                In undertaking this audit, the Board has applied its standard
                audit practice following its published protocols. The Board’s
                standard practice and audit activities include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Formal notification of the Board’s intent to audit by letter;

              </ul>
              <p>
                These audit activities allow the company to demonstrate whether
                its management system and programs comply. They also allow the
                Board to evaluate the company with respect to: assuring
                compliance to regulatory requirements; and assuring appropriate
                safety, security and environmental outcomes as described in OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Alliance uses a common management system and Emergency
                Management program and at the time of the audit divided its
                Canadian assets into four operational regions: Grande Prairie,
                Whitecourt/Morinville, Kerrobert, and Regina. The Board
                therefore developed its audit plan to evaluate Alliance’s
                management system and Emergency Management program and to assure
                that it was appropriate to manage and applied to all of its
                regulated facilities regardless of location. To this end, the
                Board conducted interviews, inspections and documentation and
                record reviews in each region as well as the Calgary office. It
                is the Board’s expectation that any audit Non-Compliant findings
                made and corrective actions required by the Board must be
                applied across all of Alliance’s Board regulated systems.

                The Board informed Alliance of its intent to audit its NEB
                regulated facilities in a letter dated 24&nbsp;June 2014.
                Following the issuance of that letter, Board audit staff met
                with Alliance staff on a regular basis to arrange and coordinate
                this audit. The Board also provided Alliance with an information
                guidance document to help Alliance prepare for the audit as well
                as to provide access to documentation and records to demonstrate
                its compliance. Alliance established a digital access portal for
                Board staff to review documentation and records.

              <p>
                On 27&nbsp;April 2015, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from Alliance in Calgary, Alberta to confirm the
                Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. The opening meeting
                was followed by Calgary office interviews from 27&nbsp;April to
                1&nbsp;May 2015, and various field level audit activities as

              <p>
                From 30&nbsp;July to 6&nbsp;August 2015, the Board held an audit
                pre-close-out meeting with Alliance. At this meeting Board staff
                and Alliance staff discussed potential deficiencies identified
                during field activities and discussed additional information
                that could be of value to the Board prior to compiling its draft
                audit report. An audit close-out meeting was held on
                30&nbsp;September 2015 to provide Alliance with a description of
                the recommendations that staff would be bringing to the Board
                for decision.

                OPR, section&nbsp;6.1 outlines the Board’s management system
                requirements as follows:

              </div>
              <p>
                In assessing Alliance’s management system the Board applied the
                definitions and guidance as described in Section&nbsp;1.0 Audit
                Terminology and Definitions of this report. The Board’s audit of
                Alliance’s regulated facilities found that Alliance has not
                established, implemented and maintained a management system that
                meets the requirements of the OPR. Currently, Alliance relies on
                their protection programs practices and activities to ensure
                that it meets the Board’s requirements to ensure the safety and
                security of the people, the pipeline and the protection of the
                environment. This is evident in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/A159-mrgnc/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                as the majority of the Non-Compliant findings relate to a lack
                of a documented management system process. While Alliance has
                established and implemented certain processes that could be
                considered part of their management system, it was limited to
                these processes and does account for all of the requirements set
                forth in OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1 and&nbsp;6.5(1). As a result,
                the Board has found Alliance Non-Compliant with OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.1(<em>a</em>) to&nbsp;(<em>e</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that Alliance’s records indicate that an
                <em>Operational Excellence Management System</em> (OEMS) was
                implemented in 2008 for the purpose of creating a structured
                platform for the ongoing identification and active discussion of
                operational risks. Since then, quarterly OEMS management review
                meetings have been held to which discussions on current risks,
                operational matters and regulatory updates are discussed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance’s records also indicated that an internal evaluation of
                OEMS was conducted in 2012, which resulted in a new iteration of
                Alliance’s management system that is being rebranded as the
                <em>Operational Risk Management System</em> (ORMS). Alliance
                indicated that ORMS is
                <em
                  >“designed to be an overarching, integrated framework of
                  vision, policies, standards, programs and governance processes
                  to be used by the company in working towards meeting it’s
                  corporate objectives of “zero safety, pipeline or
                  environmental incidents and compliant, ethical and good
                  neighbor wherever we operate”</em
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of when Alliance started its management system
                development, the Board’s audit identified that Alliance’s
                management system was in a transitory state between the
                program-based management practices it used in the past and its
                new management system approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                In determining Alliance’s compliance with respect to
                establishing and implementing a management system, the Board
                reviewed the audit results of Alliance’s Emergency Management
                program processes along with the audit results of other Board
                program audits completed concurrently. This aided the Board in
                evaluating Alliance’s systematic practices and deficiencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not met the requirements for
                establishing and implementing a management system. For the most
                part, this reflected the transitory nature of its management
                system as applied to the Emergency Management program. The
                issues related to designing and establishing processes as
                described below and in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/A159-mrgnc/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                also contributed to the Board’s Non-Compliant finding. This is
                especially true with respect to Alliance’s Quality Assurance
                Program and auditing process design.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that it is important to understand that the
                Board’s management system Non-Compliant finding reflects the
                company’s deficiencies in developing and applying its management
                system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of technical
                management activities being undertaken to ensure the safety of
                the pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that, regardless of the reasons for
                non-compliance, companies were required to be compliant with the
                Board’s management system requirements when the OPR were updated
                in 2013. Alliance will need to develop and implement corrective
                actions to ensure establishment and implementation of its
                management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of Alliance’s Corrective Action Plan to address its
                management system Non-Compliant finding, the Board is of the
                view that, Alliance must develop and implement a compliant
                document control processes that meet OPR requirements for all
                new and existing documents in the company’s management system.
                This will serve to assure that the management system processes
                are designed appropriately and that existing or referenced
                documents fully meet the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                against the OPR requirements, the Board has determined that
                Alliance is Non-Compliant with section&nbsp;6.1. Alliance will
                have to develop a Corrective Action Plan to address the
                described deficiencies.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate Emergency Management programs into their
                day-to-day operations. These programs must ensure that pipelines
                are operated in a manner that protects the environment and the
                safety of the workers and the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit Alliance indicated that the Board’s required
                Emergency Management program requirements correspond to the
                company’s Health &amp; Safety Management System. The Board has
                identified that primary responsibility for Alliance’s Emergency
                Management program resides within its Health and Safety
                department. This department is comprised of subject matter
                experts who are responsible for providing emergency management
                leadership, promotion and direction in organizational activities
                through management system development and maintenance,
                stewardship, technical knowledge and support for Alliance
                employees and contractors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board identified that responsibility for implementation of
                the Emergency Management program resides with a number
                Alliance’s functional departments. The Board therefore
                considered the sum of the Health and Safety department and all
                other departments’ safety management related responsibilities as
                comprising the Emergency Management program for the purposes of
                this audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that the practices presently used by Alliance
                identified the majority, and most significant, of its hazards
                and that Alliance has developed and implemented the operational
                controls and inspection and monitoring programs to address these
                hazards. The Board also found that Alliance’s Emergency
                Management program has been in existence for many years, thus
                the health and safety related practices and procedures are well
                established within the organization. Notwithstanding these
                practices and procedures, the audit identified several
                non-compliant findings. The majority of the findings fall into
                three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Alliance’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Alliance must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval detailing how it
                intends to resolve Non-Compliances identified by this audit. The
                Board will assess the implementation of the corrective actions
                to confirm that they are completed in an expedient manner, and
                on a system-wide basis. The Board will also continue to monitor
                the overall implementation and effectiveness of Alliance’s
                management system and Emergency Management program through
                targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
                on-going regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published Audit
                Protocol, which identifies five&nbsp;Management System elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
                regulatory requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a
                company’s program is deficient in any regulatory requirement,
                the entire sub-element will be found non-compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company will have to develop a corrective action plan to
                demonstrate to the Board that appropriate actions will be taken
                to achieve full compliance.

              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 &ndash; Leadership and Accountability
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must appoint an Accountable Officer and notify the Board
                of the appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance had submitted a written notice to the NEB indicating
                that it had appointed an Accountable Officer. In its submission,
                Alliance confirmed that its Accountable Officer had authority
                over the human and financial resources required to meet the
                Board’s substantive expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided by Alliance, the Board has not
                identified any non-compliance issues. The Board has therefore
                assessed this sub-element as Compliant.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 &ndash; Policy and Commitment Statements
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have documented policies and goals to ensure the
                safety and security of the public, workers, and the pipeline and
                ensure protection of property and the environment. Further, as
                these policies and goals are to be used to establish and
                implement the management and programs, the Board requires that
                the policies and goals be explicit from the perspective of
                design, content and communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had corporate and program level
                policies and goals that related to the Emergency Management
                program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the many policies, programs and initiatives that
                Alliance had developed to direct and support its Emergency
                Management program, the Board identified non-compliance in the
                Policy and Commitment Statements sub-element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alliance did not demonstrate that it had a policy that was fully
                explicit on the internal reporting of hazards, potential
                hazards, incidents and near misses (in that there was no pointed
                reference to “potential hazards”). Furthermore, Alliance’s
                policy statement did not fully describe the conditions under
                which a person making a report will be granted immunity from
                disciplinary action (in that there was no explanation as to what
                constituted good-faith reporting).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and the Emergency Management program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Alliance is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Alliance will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential
                hazards, assessing the degree of risk associated with the
                hazards, and implementing control measures to minimize or
                eliminate risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system process for the
                identification of hazards and potential hazards as required by
                the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that while a management system deficiency
                currently exists, the Board did verify that key hazards are
                being identified and controlled through established Emergency
                Management program level practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance did not demonstrate that it has
                established and maintained an inventory of hazards and potential
                hazards at the management system level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance established various
                inventories at the Emergency Management program level but do not
                comprise an Emergency Management hazard and potential hazard
                inventory.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system for the evaluation
                and managing of the risks associated with the identified
                hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance’s Emergency Management program
                practices do not meet the OPR requirements with respect to
                process design and implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Alliance’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the

              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 &ndash; Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and monitoring compliance with all legal
                requirements applicable to the company. The company must also
                maintain a list of the legal requirements that apply to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system process for
                identifying and monitoring compliance with applicable legal
                requirements and thus is in non-compliance with OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>g</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has established and
                maintained a legal list that includes its federal and provincial
                requirements. However, this legal list does not include
                referenced standards and thus is non-compliant with OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>h</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance’s Emergency Management program
                practices does include the identification and monitoring
                compliance with applicable emergency management legal
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance’s Emergency Management
                program practices do not meet the OPR requirements with respect
                to process design and implementation.
              </p>

              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for developing and setting goals, objectives and
                specific targets for the risks and hazards associated with the
                company’s facilities and activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a management system and Emergency Management process
                for setting objectives and specific targets as required by the
                OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has developed goals for the
                prevention of ruptures, fatalities and injuries but has not
                developed goals for the response to incidents and emergency
                situations. The Board also found that Alliance goals for the
                prevention of liquid and gas releases is limited to its pipeline
                right-of-way and does not include its aboveground facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has based its management
                system and Emergency Management program on these goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has established performance
                measures to assess the company’s success in achieving its goals,
                objectives and targets.

              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have a documented organizational structure that
                enables it to meet the requirements of its management system.
                The company must also complete an annual documented evaluation
                to demonstrate that there is adequate human resourcing to meet
                these obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has a documented emergency
                management organizational structure and communicates the roles,
                responsibilities and authorities of the officers and employees
                at all levels of the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance did not demonstrate that the
                human resources allocated to establishing, implementing and
                maintaining its management system are sufficient to meet the
                requirements of the management system and to meet the company’s

                The Board notes that the Emergency Management program is
                designed to address only abnormal or upset operations. This
                section is therefore considered not to apply in this audit. The
                review of Alliance’s controls is documented in

              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the

                potential for upset or abnormal operating conditions, accidental
                releases, incidents and emergency situations. This sub-element
                also included requirements for companies to establish and
                implement a process for developing contingency plans for
                abnormal events that may occur during construction, operation,
                maintenance, abandonment or emergency situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has developed controls that

                risks relating to upset and abnormal operating conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has not established and

                developing and implementing controls and thus is in
                non-compliance with OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>f</em>).

                The Board found that Alliance demonstrated that it had
                established and implemented a number of management of change
                processes, procedures and practices to document and manage
                change. However, these processes, practices and procedures
                function independently of one another and thus are not
                systematic.

              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for developing competency requirements and training
                programs for its employees and contractors. These competency
                requirements and training programs must enable employees and
                contractors to perform their duties in a manner that is safe,
                ensures the security of the pipeline, and protects the
                environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance has not established and
                implemented a documented management system and Emergency
                Management program process for developing competencies and
                training programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Alliance has developed and implemented
                training programs for all employees and has developed
                competencies for its field maintenance technicians. However,
                these competencies are limited to matters of safety and do not
                include emergency management considerations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance has established and

              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance has not developed a program
                that meets the requirements of the OPR for a continuing
                education program.

                meet the company’s obligations for conducting activities in a
                manner that ensures the safety and security of the public,
                company employees and the pipeline, and that protects property
                and the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance had established and implemented a

                for preparing, reviewing, revising and controlling its
                documents. However, this process does not include defined
                revision schedules for its documents and thus is in
                non-compliance with OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>o</em>).

              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has developed documents that would
                be typically expected for a company of its size and to the
                scope, nature and complexity of its activities.

                inspecting and monitoring its activities and facilities. This is
                so that the company can evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness
                of the protection programs and take corrective and preventive
                actions if deficiencies are identified.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has not established and

              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Alliance has conducted emergency responses
                exercises. However, the design and implementation of these
                exercises do not ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of
                Alliance’s emergency response plan.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive
                commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and
                environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s
                regulation must establish and implement effective management
                systems and incorporate emergency management programs into their
                day-to-day operations. These programs must ensure that pipelines
                are operated in a manner that protects the environment, the
                safety of the workers and the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this audit Alliance was required to demonstrate the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its management system and
                Emergency Management program to the Board. The Board reviewed
                documentation and records provided by Alliance, conducted
                inspections and interviewed Alliance staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on its review, the Board found that Alliance was in a
                transitory period in terms of establishing and implementing its
                management system. Additionally, the Board’s audit found that
                some of Alliance’s management system processes were not designed
                in a manner that allowed its management system to meet the
                requirements of OPR section&nbsp;6.1. Consequently, the Board
                has found that Alliance’s management system is Non-Compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Alliance’s Emergency Management program
                reflected the transitory nature of Alliance’s management system
                and process issues as noted. The Board’s audit found, however,
                and most importantly, that, regardless of the design and
                implementation status of its management system, Alliance’s
                Emergency Management program and the processes and practices
                being used, identified and controlled the majority and most
                significant of the company’s emergency management related
                hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In analyzing Alliance’s Non-Compliant findings the Board has

                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;

                  Non-compliances relating to Alliance’s interpretation of OPR

              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the majority of all of the Non-Compliant
                findings made by the Board relate to management system process
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that while no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address these non-compliant findings, as
                per the Board’s standard audit practice, Alliance must develop
                and submit a corrective action plan describing its proposed
                methods to resolve the non-compliances identified and the
                timeline in which corrective actions will be completed. Alliance
                will be required to submit its corrective action plan for
                approval within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being
                issued by the Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of Alliance’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of Alliance’s Emergency
                Management program and management system as a whole through
                targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
                ongoing regulatory mandate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make its Final Audit Report and Alliance’s
                approved corrective action plan public on the Board’s website.

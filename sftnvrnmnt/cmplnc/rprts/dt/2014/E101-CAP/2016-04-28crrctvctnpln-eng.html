            The National Energy Board (NEB or Board) has examined Enbridge’s CAP
            submitted by letter dated 30&nbsp;April 2015 in response to the
            findings identified in the Board’s final OPR Audit Report for the
            Integrity Management, Safety Management, Emergency Management, Third
            Party Crossings and Public Awareness Programs Final Audit Reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has reviewed Enbridge’s proposed CAP as documented and
            approves them subject to the additional direction in the attached
            Table.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes the length of time between submission and approval
            of Enbridge’s CAP and acknowledges that Enbridge has indicated to
            Board staff during ongoing interactions that it has already
            implemented many of the proposed commitments as part of its
            responsible management practices in anticipation of the Board’s
            approval. While the Board’s assessment of Enbridge’s proposed CAP
            has not resulted in significant or numerous changes to the CAP, the
            Board recognizes that the timing and content of this approval may
            cause Enbridge to have to adjust its development and implementation
            schedules. The Board, therefore, directs Enbridge to file any
            updated development and implementation schedules confirming or
            adjusting the CAP completion dates, as necessary by 29&nbsp;May 2016
            for Board approval.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge shall file with the NEB quarterly CAP implementation
            updates beginning 30&nbsp;June 2016. The information filed should
            verify that corrective actions and schedules implemented address the
            findings identified in the Final Report and the directions in the
            attached Table. The Board will determine whether the individual
            corrective actions are adequately and effectively implemented during
            future compliance activities. The Board may also, in specific
            circumstances, determine that a site visit is necessary. In that
            case, Enbridge will be contacted to arrange a mutually agreeable
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board’s Final Audit Reports made Non-Compliant Findings against
            legal requirements described in the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and associated
            Regulations, Certificates and Orders and, where appropriate, the
            <em>Canada Labour Code</em

            (CLC) and referenced standards. Accordingly, CAP closure will be
            based on the Board’s assessment of the outcomes of Enbridge’s
            corrective actions and as measured against the CAP taking into
            consideration legal requirements, applicable CLC requirements and
            the audit report documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also notes that, to be compliant with the OPR, companies
            must establish and implement the required management system
            practices and processes as part of their management system and each
            required program listed in section&nbsp;55 of the OPR. Therefore,
            Enbridge must demonstrate the applicability and implementation of
            the required management system practices and processes included in
            its CAP as per OPR section&nbsp;6.5 to be evaluated as Compliant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that Enbridge has attributed some of the Audit
            Report Findings and regulatory expectations and interpretations to
            the Board’s audit staff. For clarity, all audit reports and
            information contained therein represent the findings and
            interpretations of the Board and should be considered and addressed
            as such.

                    The Board notes that Enbridge has not included a specific
                    commitment to ensure that its CAP also includes
                    establishment and implementation of a process for monitoring
                    compliance as required by OPR 6.5(1) (g).

                  <p>
                    The Board directs that Enbridge establish and implement this
                    process as part of its CAP.

                  <p>
                    The Board has assessed Enbridge’s proposed CAP and has not
                    identified any significant concerns with the approach or
                    schedule. The Board, however, notes that Enbridge’s
                    commitment is limited to developing a process “to link
                    significant processes together to ensure operational
                    activities of employees and contractors are coordinated and
                    controlled”. The Board is concerned that the processes
                    contemplated to be linked within the proposed CAP include
                    processes identified as deficient. The Board’s audit reports
                    identified that Enbridge’s processes did not meet the
                    requirements of OPR section&nbsp;6.5 (1) (k) and (q). The
                    Board is of the opinion that linking the previously
                    identified deficient processes will not result in a
                    compliant process as proposed. While Enbridge may be
                    considering the establishment of compliant processes within
                    its overall CAP, the Board did not identify specific
                    commitments to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Board, therefore, directs Enbridge to ensure that, as
                    part of its CAP, it establishes and implements processes in
                    accordance with OPR paragraphs&nbsp;6.5 (1)(k) and (q).

                  <p>
                    The Board has considered Enbridge’s proposed CAP and has
                    identified no concerns with the approach or schedule with
                    the exception of the milestone commitment “Implementation of
                    the Workforce Competency and Qualification Process to align
                    with existing stakeholders processes with safety critical
                    positions”. In its CAP, Enbridge limits wording to “safety
                    critical” activities. The Board is of the opinion that
                    environmental protection activities should also be included.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Enbridge is therefore directed to add “environmental
                    protection” critical tasks wherever safety critical is
                    mentioned within this CAP item and implement the
                    necessitated changes as per the proposed schedule.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Board is also concerned that Enbridge may be limiting
                    its interpretation of “safety critical” to occupational
                    health and safety considerations. The Board reminds Enbridge
                    that it considers safety of the public within the definition
                    of safety in its requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Enbridge is therefore directed to ensure that its CAP
                    accounts for this safety definition.

                    The Board finds that this CAP is inadequate as proposed.

                  <p>
                    Enbridge has committed to developing “a management system
                    level internal and external communication process that
                    aligns with existing internal and external communication
                    processes.” The Board notes that its final audit reports
                    indicated that in addition to Enbridge’s corporate processes
                    being inadequate the practices being utilized within the
                    programs were not all identified to be adequate to meet the
                    Board’s requirements or implemented as required by
                    Enbridge’s existing processes and practices. Therefore, the
                    Board is of the opinion that the CAP as proposed, cannot
                    result in compliant communication processes being
                    established and implemented as they align with deficient
                    processes. Enbridge is directed to re-develop its CAP for
                    this sub-element to ensure that its processes meet the
                    Board’s management system and program requirements as
                    identified in the Final Audit Reports and submit it for
                    approval by 29&nbsp;May 2016.

                    The Board approves this CAP with respect to development of
                    its Quality Assurance (QA) Program; however, the Board
                    reminds Enbridge that, to be compliant, the CAP developed
                    should not be limited to a re-development and
                    re-organization of existing activities but must also include
                    consideration of standard QA principles and program
                    requirements such as, for example, management and leadership
                    responsibilities and activities, QA objectives, targets and
                    performance measures and QA activities outside of normal

                    With respect to Enbridge’s CAP commitment regarding
                    Corrective and Preventive Action processes, the Board notes
                    that Enbridge has limited its references to the Emergency
                    Management and Environmental Protection Programs Final Audit
                    Reports when it is also identified as a deficiency in the

                  <p>
                    Enbridge is directed to ensure that its CAP for this

                    The Board approves Enbridge’s CAP but notes that, in its
                    CAP, Enbridge states that “the regulations do not explicitly
                    require an Emergency Management Policy”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Board notes that the OPR&nbsp;6.3(1) specifically
                    requires that companies shall establish documented policies
                    and goals for meeting its obligations under section&nbsp;6.
                    The Board notes that section&nbsp;6 obligations specifically
                    include the safety and security of the public and the
                    company’s employees and the protection of the environment
                    and property throughout the asset lifecycle which would
                    logically include addressing incidents or emergencies.
                    Further, the OPRs indicate that the company must base its
                    management system and programs referred to in OPR
                    section&nbsp;55 (Emergency Management programs are
                    specifically referred to under section&nbsp;55 (a)) on the
                    policies established under section&nbsp;6.3. Additionally
                    the OPRs indicate that management systems must be “explicit”
                    in their design and documentation. Based on these
                    requirements, the Board has determined that Enbridge must
                    have explicit EM programs policies and goals to be compliant
                    and ensure that they meet their safety and environmental
                    protection obligations.

                    The EM Program Final Audit Report identified that Enbridge
                    “must demonstrate a documented process that specifically
                    includes direct links between its hazards and evaluations of
                    risk to the determination of the types, approach and
                    development of these controls”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Enbridge is directed to ensure that its CAP explicitly
                    addresses these requirements.

                    The Board notes that Enbridge has committed to developing
                    and documenting “an annual process that evaluates human
                    resource needs required to respond in an emergency and as
                    part of emergency planning. This process will ensure that
                    Enbridge can demonstrate its human resources are sufficient
                    for a hypothetical high consequence scenario.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Board notes that Enbridge’s proposed CAP is limited to
                    identifying human resource needs and availability based on
                    one scenario per region based on a risk based methodology.

                  <p>
                    The Board notes that its Final Audit Report identified that
                    any company must be able to demonstrate “the sufficiency of
                    its human resources to meet its obligations to ensure the
                    safety of the public, its employees and the pipeline; and
                    ensure the protection of property and the environment in a
                    documented manner” during an incident. It is the Board’s
                    opinion that Enbridge’s proposed CAP may not address the
                    Board’s finding as it limits itself to one scenario versus a
                    fulsome review of the potential human resource requirements
                    from the perspective of both numbers and skill sets based on
                    a plausible range of scenarios.

                    The Board finds that this CAP is inadequate as proposed.

                    The Board directs Enbridge to submit a CAP for approval that
                    addresses the Board’s Non-Compliant findings by 29&nbsp;May
                    2016.

                    The Board approves the CAP but reminds Enbridge that any

                    third-parties are communicated with appropriately with
                    respect to legal requirements as identified in the report.

                    The Board approves Enbridge’s CAP but states that, “the
                    regulations do not explicitly require an Integrity
                    Management Policy”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Board notes that the OPR&nbsp;6.3(1) specifically
                    requires that companies must establish documented policies
                    and goals for meeting its obligations under section&nbsp;6.
                    The Board notes that section&nbsp;6 obligations specifically
                    include the safety and security of the public and the
                    pipeline throughout the asset lifecycle which would, in the
                    Board’s view, include addressing incidents or emergencies.
                    Further, the OPR’s indicate that the company must base its
                    management system and programs referred to in OPR
                    section&nbsp;55 (Emergency Management programs are
                    specifically referred to under section&nbsp;55 (b)) on the
                    policies established under section&nbsp;6.3. Additionally
                    the OPRs indicate that compliant management systems must be
                    explicit in their design and documentation. Based on these
                    requirements, the Board has determined that Enbridge and
                    other companies must have explicit IM programs policies and
                    goals to be compliant and ensure that they meet their safety
                    obligations.

                    The Board notes that CSA&nbsp;Z662, 2015 version, has now
                    been released. This version indicates that a company must
                    develop and implement a program to monitor (i.e. test) the
                    H<sub>2</sub>S in its crude because it constitutes a
                    potential hazard to the pipeline. CSA&nbsp;Z662-15,
                    Clause&nbsp;16.1.2 defines the levels of H<sub>2</sub>S that
                    are considered to be “sour service”. Clause&nbsp;16.2.1 (a)
                    (ii) defines this as less than 425&nbsp;ppm dissolved
                    H<sub>2</sub>S as determined by the ASTM&nbsp;UOP163 test
                    method. Therefore, the 2015 version is specific as to the
                    concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S as well as specific as to
                    the test method.

                    The Board directs Enbridge to submit a CAP for approval that
                    addresses the Board’s Non-Compliant finding and the
                    requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 by 29&nbsp;May 2016.

              <p>
                The Board has completed its Final Report for its audit of
                Enbridge’s Emergency Management Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Draft Report documenting the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s
                Emergency Management Program was provided to Enbridge on
                4&nbsp;February 2015 for review and comment. On 6&nbsp;March
                2015, Enbridge submitted its response.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has considered Enbridge’s comments and has made
                changes to the Final Audit Report and its Appendices as it
                determined to be appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of
                whether Enbridge was compliant with the regulatory requirements
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enbridge’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Enbridge was required to demonstrate the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the methods selected and employed within its
                Programs to meet the regulatory requirements listed above.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has enclosed the Final Audit Report and associated
                appendices with this letter. The Board will make the Final Audit
                Report public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the issuance of the Final Audit Report by
                the Board, Enbridge is required to file a Corrective Action Plan
                (CAP), which describes the methods and timing for addressing the
                Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for
                approval.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the CAP public and will continue to monitor
                and assess all of Enbridge’s corrective actions with respect to
                this audit until they are fully implemented. The Board will also
                continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                Enbridge’s Emergency Management Program and management system
                through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of
                its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and Emergency Management.
                Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to
                incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations. These systems and
                associated technical management programs include the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure NEB regulated
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. In the public
                interest, the Board holds companies accountable for safety and
                environmental outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s comprehensive audit of
                Enbridge’s management system and Emergency Management program
                applicable to its facilities that are regulated by the NEB. The
                audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. This amendment clarified
                the Board’s expectations for establishing and implementing a
                documented management system and Emergency Management program.
                Before issuing the amendment, the Board consulted and
                communicated with its regulated companies with respect to the
                new requirements; therefore, an implementation grace period was
                not given when the OPR was promulgated. As a result, when
                evaluating compliance, this audit did not consider any extra
                time Enbridge may have needed to implement changes associated
                with the formalized management system requirements. As indicated
                in the amendments, companies must have an effective and
                well-documented Emergency Management program as a key component
                of their management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published audit
                protocol, which identifies five management system elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100 per cent of the regulatory
                requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a company’s
                program is found to be deficient with respect to any regulatory
                requirement, the entire sub-element will be found Non-Compliant.
                This report also includes an assessment of Enbridge’s management
                system against the requirements of OPR, section&nbsp;6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Enbridge’s regulated facilities found that
                Enbridge is in the process of establishing and implementing a
                management system that reflects its commitment to applying a
                formal management structure to all of its business functions and
                departments. Enbridge has not limited its management system to
                the technical programs required by the Board and was
                implementing a corporate management system, not merely an
                operations management system as many companies have done in
                response to the Board’s regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that Enbridge’s records indicate that it started
                developing its management system after the Board’s Integrity
                Management and Safety Management program audits in 2009. This
                was before Enbridge was notified of the intended OPR changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of when Enbridge started its management system
                development, its commitment to establishing and implementing a
                corporate management system for all of its Board regulated
                business and facilities is a large, complex undertaking. The
                Board therefore identified that Enbridge’s management system is
                in a transitory state between the program-based management
                practices it used in the past and its new management system
                approach. This has contributed to a Non-Compliant finding
                related to establishing and implementing a compliant management
                system. It is important to understand that the Board’s finding
                regarding Enbridge’s management system primarily reflects the
                company’s stage in developing and applying its management
                system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of technical
                management activities being undertaken to ensure the safety of
                the pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Enbridge’s management system included an
                assessment of the individual management system processes as
                described in the OPR and the Board’s audit protocol. As
                documented in this report, the Board found that Enbridge has
                documented many of the required processes within its Integrated
                Management System. However, the Board found that some of
                Enbridge’s management system processes were not sufficiently
                systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive to meet the
                OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that, regardless of the reasons for
                non-compliance, companies were required to be compliant with the
                Board’s management system requirements when the Onshore Pipeline
                Regulations were updated in 2013. Enbridge will need to develop
                and implement corrective actions to ensure establishment and
                implementation of its management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to evaluating Enbridge’s management system and
                associated processes, the Board’s audit also included an
                evaluation of Enbridge’s Emergency Management program to
                determine the applicability and integration of the management
                system within it and to assess whether Enbridge is meeting its
                requirements to develop, implement and maintain an Emergency
                Management program that anticipates, prevents, manages and
                mitigates conditions that could adversely affect the environment
                during the operation and maintenance of its pipeline. The Board
                found that, notwithstanding the documentation issues relating to
                its management system processes, the processes and practices
                presently used by Enbridge identified the majority, and most
                significant, of its emergency management related hazards and
                that Enbridge has developed and implemented operational controls
                and inspection and monitoring programs to address these hazards.
                The Board notes that Enbridge’s Emergency Management program has
                been in existence for many years, thus its related  practices
                and procedures are well established within the organization. The
                Board did identify some deficiencies not related to management
                system process development. All of the Board’s findings are
                documented in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-mrgnc/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                In analyzing the results of its audit as a whole, the Board
                notes that it has made a significant number of Non-Compliant
                findings. The majority of these findings fall into three general
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Enbridge’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the majority of all of the Non-Compliant
                findings made by the Board relate to management system process
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that enforcement actions are not
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Enbridge must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval. The Corrective Action
                Plan must detail how Enbridge intends to resolve the
                non-compliances identified by this audit. The Board will assess
                implementation of the corrective actions to confirm they are
                completed in a timely manner and applied consistently across
                Enbridge’s regulated system. The Board will also continue to
                monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of
                Enbridge’s management system and Emergency Management program
                through targeted compliance verification activities as part of
                its ongoing regulatory mandate.

                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses
                the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains
                the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent
                basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented,
                meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.

                of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> and its associated
                regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained
                on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others
                working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the
                process or other requirement. Records and interviews have
                provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as
                prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially
                utilized).

              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5 (1)(<em>o</em>). With records, the
                company must demonstrate that it meets the records management

                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet

                  >OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) describes the Board’s required
                  management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                  management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                  process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                  developed or maintained as described within each section;
                  whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                  designed to address the requirements of the process, for
                  example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards
                  and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit
                  required actions including roles, responsibilities and
                  authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing
                  the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common
                  5&nbsp;w’s and h approach (who, what, where, when, why and
                  how). The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have
                  multiple requirements; companies may therefore establish and
                  implement multiple processes, as long as they are designed to
                  meet the legal requirements and integrate any processes
                  linkages contemplated by the OPR section. Processes must
                  incorporate or contain linkage to procedures, where required
                  to meet the process requirements.</em

                <em
                  >As the processes constitute part of the management system,
                  the required processes must be developed in a manner that
                  allows them to function as part of the system. The required
                  management system is described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The
                  processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the
                  company following its policies and goals established and
                  required by section&nbsp;6.3.</em

                  >Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each process
                  must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the
                  programs referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be
                  compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which
                  considers the specific technical requirements associated with
                  each program and is applied to and meets the process
                  requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that
                  single process may not meet all of the programs; in these
                  cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as
                  long as they meet the process requirements (as described
                  above) and direct the program processes to be established and
                  implemented in a consistent manner that allows for the
                  management system to function as described in&nbsp;6.1.</em

                outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in
                other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company
                regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the
                program is achieving the intended results.

              <h2 id="s3">3.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection and efficient energy infrastructure and
                markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set
                by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy development
                and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are designed,
                constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that ensures:
                the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection
                of the environment, the Board has developed regulations
                requiring companies to establish and implement documented
                management systems applicable to specified technical management
                and protection programs. These management systems and programs
                must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the
                NEB Act and its associated regulations. The Board’s management
                system requirements are described within OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1
                through&nbsp;6.6.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the audit, the Board reviews the compliance and
                incident history of the company as recorded in NEB files. This
                helps the Board determine the appropriate scope for the audit.
                During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and samples
                records provided by the company in its demonstration of
                compliance and interviews corporate and regionally-based staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also conducts separate but linked technical
                inspections of a representative sample of company facilities.
                This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness
                and implementation of the management system and programs. The
                Board bases the scope and location of the inspections on the
                needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard
                inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the
                audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If
                unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an
                inspection, they are actioned as set out by the Board’s standard
                inspection and enforcement practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines the
                Board’s audit activities, provides evaluations of the company’s
                management system and programs, identifies deficiencies and
                communicates compliance findings. The audit report follows the
                format of the Board’s published Audit Protocol. Once the Board
                issues the Final Audit Report, the company must submit and
                implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all Non-Compliant
                findings. Final Audit Reports are published on the Board’s
                website. The audit results are integrated into NEB’s
                risk-informed lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.

              <h2 id="s4">4.0 Background</h2>
              <p>
                Enbridge operates approximately 10,733&nbsp;km of pipeline in
                six Canadian provinces and territories. These pipeline
                facilities include pump stations, tankage and associated
                operational assets. All of these facilities are within the
                definition of a “pipeline” as included in the NEB Act. Enbridge
                also has a considerable amount of non-federally regulated
                infrastructure in Alberta and across the United States, which
                complete its North American system. Enbridge’s system allows it
                to transport liquids from northern and western Canada to
                end-users in the Eastern regions of Canada and the United
                States. In order for Enbridge to operate its pipelines
                effectively, it has developed a management structure that
                reflects its safety and security management, and environmental
                obligations, as well as its corporate, national, regional and
                international needs. Enbridge Pipelines Inc. controls and uses
                several entities that hold NEB-issued certificates for operating
                in Canada. The entities included within the scope of this audit
                are identified in Section&nbsp;5.0, Audit Objectives and Scope
                of this report.
              </p>
              <p>
                During audit planning, company staff indicated that Enbridge and
                its subsidiaries operate the pipelines and facilities using a
                common management system and technical programs. In order to
                effectively evaluate compliance of such an expansive system
                within a reasonable timeframe, the Board chose to conduct
                individual, comprehensive audits of Enbridge’s required
                technical programs and management system. This report documents
                one of six management system and program audits. The audits are
                titled:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Enbridge Integrity Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Safety Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Enbridge Environmental Protection Program Audit;</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Emergency Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Enbridge Third-Party Crossings Program Audit; and</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Public Awareness Program Audit.</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Audit results confirmed that Enbridge operates its facilities
                using a common organizational structure to implement a common
                governance management system that applies to all of its business
                and operational activities. Some findings are therefore similar
                in each audit and the individual audit reports reflect this.

              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to determine the establishment
                and implementation of Enbridge’s management system and the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its Emergency Management program.
                Enbridge was audited against the requirements contained within
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enbridge’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. This amendment clarified
                the Board’s expectations for establishing and implementing a
                documented management system and Emergency Management program.
                Before issuing the amendment, the Board consulted and
                communicated with its regulated companies with respect to the
                new requirements; therefore, an implementation grace period was
                not given when the OPR was promulgated. As a result, when
                evaluating compliance, this audit did not consider any extra
                time Enbridge may have needed to implement changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. companies hold a number of
                certificates to operate in Canada. The Board has included the
                following companies within the scope of this audit:

                In undertaking this audit, the Board has applied its standard
                audit practice following its published protocols. The Board’s
                standard practice and audit activities include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Formal notification of the Board’s intent to audit by letter;

              </ul>
              <p>
                These audit activities allow the company to demonstrate whether
                its management system and programs comply. They also allow the
                Board to evaluate the company with respect to: assuring
                compliance to regulatory requirements; and assuring appropriate
                safety, security and environmental outcomes as described in OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. operates an expansive liquids
                pipeline system using a common management system and Emergency
                Management program. Furthermore, Enbridge divides its Canadian
                assets into five  operational regions: Northern Region, Western
                Region, Central Region, Southern Prairie Region and Eastern
                Region. The Board therefore developed its audit plan to evaluate
                Enbridge’s management system and Emergency Management program
                and to assure that it was appropriate to manage and applied to
                all of its regulated facilities regardless of location. To this
                end, the Board conducted interviews, inspections and
                documentation and record reviews in each region as well as the
                Edmonton  office. It is the Board’s expectation that any audit
                Non-Compliant findings made and corrective actions required by
                the Board must be applied across all of Enbridge’s Board
                regulated systems and subsidiaries.

                The Board informed Enbridge Pipelines Inc. of its intent to
                audit its NEB regulated facilities in a letter dated 19 December
                2013. Following the issuance of that letter, Board audit staff
                met with Enbridge staff on a regular basis to arrange and
                coordinate this audit. The Board also provided Enbridge with an
                information guidance document to help Enbridge prepare for the
                audit, and provide access to documentation and records to
                demonstrate its compliance. Enbridge established a digital
                access portal for Board staff to review documentation and
                records.

                On 5&nbsp;May 2014, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from Enbridge in Edmonton, Alberta to confirm
                the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. The opening
                meeting was followed by Edmonton office interviews from 5 to
                16&nbsp;May 2014, and various field level audit activities as
                described in the table below. Throughout the audit, Board audit
                staff gave Enbridge daily summaries with action items, where
                required.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 21 and 22&nbsp;October 2014, the Board held an audit
                pre-close-out meeting with Enbridge. At this meeting Board staff
                and Enbridge staff discussed potential deficiencies identified
                during field activities and discussed additional information
                that could be of value to the Board prior to compiling its draft
                audit report. An audit close-out meeting was held on
                17&nbsp;December 2014 to provide Enbridge with a description of
                the recommendations that staff would be bringing to the Board
                for decision.

              <p>
                OPR, section&nbsp;6.1 outlines the Board’s management system
                requirements as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                A company shall establish, implement and maintain a management
                system that
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
                <li>
                  (<em>a</em>) is systematic, explicit, comprehensive and
                  proactive;
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>b</em>) integrates the company’s operational activities
                  and technical systems with its management of human and
                  financial resources to enable the company to meet its
                  obligations under section&nbsp;6;
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>c</em>) applies to all the company’s activities involving
                  the design, construction, operation or abandonment of a
                  pipeline and to the programs referred to in section&nbsp;55;
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>d</em>) ensures coordination between the programs
                  referred to in section&nbsp;55; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>e</em>) corresponds to the size of the company, to the
                  scope, nature and complexity of its activities and to the
                  hazards and risks associated with those activities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In assessing Enbridge’s management system the Board applied the
                definitions and guidance as described in Section&nbsp;1.0 Audit
                Terminology and Definitions of this report. The Board’s audit
                results indicated that Enbridge was in the process of
                establishing and implementing a management system that reflects
                its commitment to applying a formal management structure to all
                of its regulated business operations. Enbridge has not limited
                its management system to the technical programs required by the
                Board. The company appeared to be committed to implementing a
                corporate management system and not merely an operations
                management system as many companies do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s records appeared to indicate that it started
                developing its management system after the Board’s Integrity and
                Safety Management program audits in 2009 and prior to the
                Board’s identification of its intended OPR changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of when Enbridge started its management system
                development, establishing a corporate management system
                applicable to all of its business and facilities is a large,
                complex undertaking. The Board’s audit therefore identified that
                Enbridge’s management system was in a transitory state between
                the program-based management practices it used in the past and
                its new management system approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                In determining Enbridge’s compliance with respect to
                establishing and implementing a management system, the Board
                reviewed the audit results of Enbridge’s Emergency Management
                program processes along with the audit results of other Board
                program audits completed concurrently. This aided the Board in
                evaluating Enbridge’s systematic practices and deficiencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has not met the requirements for
                establishing and implementing a management system. For the most
                part, this reflected the transitory nature of its management
                system as applied to the Emergency Management program. The
                issues related to designing and establishing processes as
                described below and in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-mrgnc/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;1</a
                >
                also contributed to the Board’s Non-Compliant finding. This is
                especially true with respect to Enbridge’s Quality Assurance
                Program and auditing process design.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that it is important to understand that the
                Board’s management system Non-Compliant finding reflects the
                company’s deficiencies in developing and applying its management
                system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of technical
                management activities being undertaken to ensure the protection
                of the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that, regardless of the reasons for
                non-compliance, companies were required to be compliant with the
                Board’s management system requirements when the OPR were updated
                in 2013. Enbridge will need to develop and implement corrective
                actions to ensure establishment and implementation of its
                management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has further detailed its evaluation below in order for
                Enbridge to understand the nature of the Board’s management
                system finding to aid in development of its Corrective Action
                Plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found Enbridge Non-Compliant with OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.1 (<em>a</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                This section requires management systems to be systematic,
                explicit, comprehensive and proactive. Enbridge’s documentation
                that describes its governance management system requirements
                clearly stated that the company’s management system is intended
                to meet these outcomes. The Board determined that Enbridge’s
                management system did meet the requirements for being
                systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive at an
                over-arching, system design level. However, as described below,
                the design of its processes, interpretation of some of the OPR
                requirements, lack of clarity with respect to some of the
                specific requirements, such as OPR section&nbsp;6.3(<em>a</em>)
                and (<em>b</em>) policies and goals and its definition of risks
                vs hazards, did not meet the OPR requirements. This resulted in
                the Board determining that the present management system
                processes will not ensure that the company’s management system
                is systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive throughout
                all levels of the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge’s governance processes for their
                management system accounted for most of the Board’s process
                requirements by description. However, as described in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-mrgnc/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >, there were issues associated with many of Enbridge’s
                processes. Enbridge has not designed all of its processes in a
                way that ensures the OPR process requirements are consistently
                met at the management system and program level. For example, the
                Board found that many of the processes did not include clear
                links to or include tier&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3 procedures where
                inclusion would ensure appropriate or consistent implementation
                of the processes at the program level. This has led to some of
                the company’s processes being comprised of commitment statements
                rather than activity descriptions. Additionally, many of the
                company’s documented processes lacked full descriptions of the
                input and output processes and the products associated with each
                process. The Board found that Enbridge generally mitigated these
                process design deficiencies from an emergency management
                perspective; however, this was accomplished by program-level
                management practices and procedures. As well, Board
                documentation and record reviews and interviews with staff
                responsible for developing processes or programs indicated that
                many of the missing process components were actually being done
                by practice but have not been documented in Enbridge’s
                management system processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of Enbridge’s Corrective Action Plan to address its
                management system Non-Compliant finding, the Board is of the
                view that, Enbridge must develop and implement a compliant
                document control processes that meet OPR requirements for all
                new and existing documents in the company’s management system.
                This will serve to assure that the management system processes
                are designed appropriately and that existing or referenced
                documents fully meet the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing Non-Compliant findings across the programs being
                audited concurrently by the Board, it is noted that several of
                the Non-Compliant findings related to Enbridge’s interpretation
                of OPR requirements. Enbridge provided specific information with
                respect to these interpretations during the audit. The Board
                noted that all regulations are subject to interpretation.
                However, many of Enbridge’s interpretations in this category did
                not reflect the wording of the regulations or standard
                management system practices. Examples of Enbridge’s
                interpretation issues can be found in the Board’s evaluation of
                the company’s quality assurance program, auditing, hazard
                identification and management of change processes, all of which
                are outlined in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-mrgnc/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                of this document.
              </p>
              <p>
                During its audit, the Board noted that Enbridge colour coded
                some process steps red in its governance process diagrams.
                According to the legend provided, red indicated that the process
                step should be considered aspirational. When interviewed,
                Enbridge staff indicated that aspirational refers to steps
                considered above regulatory requirements. The Board has given
                Enbridge and its regulated industry consistent information with
                respect to aspirational management practices. If a company
                identifies a practice as “above regulatory requirements,
                aspirational or stretch”, the Board will not hold that company
                accountable for implementing the practice as per OPR,
                section&nbsp;4. This is to allow and encourage companies to
                include aspirational goals or practices in their overall
                management practices without fear of non-compliance when
                aspirational goals are not met. The Board found that some of the
                process steps Enbridge identified as aspirational were actually
                legally required. Examples of this included steps for
                identifying and verifying competencies in Enbridge’s IMS 01,
                4.14 Workforce Competency and Qualification Process.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of the comments above contribute to the Board’s
                Non-Compliant finding with respect to OPR
                section&nbsp;6.1(<em>a</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information from Enbridge and interviews with its
                staff, the Board’s audit did not identify any non-compliant
                issues related to OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1(<em>b</em>) through
                (<em>e</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                against the OPR requirements, the Board has determined that
                Enbridge is Non-Compliant with section&nbsp;6.1. Enbridge will
                have to develop a Corrective Action Plan to address the
                described deficiencies.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate Emergency Management programs into their
                day-to-day operations. These programs must ensure that pipelines
                are operated in a manner that protects the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit Enbridge indicated that the Board’s required
                emergency management program requirements correspond to the
                company’s Emergency and Security Management System. The Board
                identified that Enbridge’s Emergency and Security Management
                System (IMS-07) is one of 19&nbsp;management systems included in
                Enbridge’s Integrated Management System (IMS). Further review of
                Enbridge’s IMS indicated that it is actually comprised of
                17&nbsp;subordinate management systems, governed by two
                governance management systems, IMS - 01, Governing Policies and
                Processes Management System and IMS - 02, Compliance and Ethics
                Management System. These governance management systems outline
                minimum corporate requirements to be incorporated into each
                sub-ordinate management system of which IMS-07b is one. As noted
                previously in section&nbsp;8.0 of this report, at the time of
                the audit the Board found that Enbridge had not established and
                implemented its required management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has identified that primary responsibility for
                Enbridge’s Emergency Management program resides within its
                Emergency and Security department. This department is comprised
                of subject matter experts who are responsible for providing
                emergency and security leadership, promotion and direction in
                organizational activities through management system development
                and maintenance, stewardship, technical knowledge and support
                for Enbridge employees and contractors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board identified that responsibility for implementation of
                the Emergency Management program resides with a number
                Enbridge’s functional departments. The Board therefore
                considered the sum of the Emergency and Security department and
                all other departments’ emergency management related
                responsibilities as comprising the Emergency Management program
                for the purposes of this audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to the transitory nature of Enbridge’s corporate management
                system, the Board found that Enbridge’s Emergency Management
                program framework was comprised of a mix of IMS processes and
                historically established and implemented processes and
                practices. It was noted during the audit that this transition
                has created gaps in continuity and consistency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that the processes presently used by Enbridge
                identified the majority, and most significant, of its hazards
                and that Enbridge has developed and implemented the operational
                controls and inspection and monitoring programs to address these
                hazards. The Board also found that Enbridge’s Emergency
                Management program has been in existence for many years, thus
                the emergency related  practices and procedures are well
                established within the organization. Notwithstanding these
                practices and procedures, the audit identified several
                non-compliant findings. The majority of the findings fall into
                three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Enbridge’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Enbridge must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval detailing how it
                intends to resolve Non-Compliances identified by this audit. The
                Board will assess the implementation of the corrective actions
                to confirm that they are completed in an expedient manner, and
                on a system-wide basis. The Board will also continue to monitor
                the overall implementation and effectiveness of Enbridge’s
                management system and Emergency Management program through
                targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
                on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2 id="s10">10.0 Summary of Audit Findings</h2>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published Audit
                Protocol, which identifies five Management System elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
                regulatory requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a
                company’s program is deficient in any regulatory requirement,
                the entire sub-element will be found non-compliant. The company
                will have to develop a corrective action plan to demonstrate to
                the Board that appropriate actions will be taken to achieve full
                compliance.
              </p>

              <h3>Element&nbsp;1.0 - Policy and Commitment</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 - Leadership and Accountability</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must appoint an Accountable Officer and notify the Board
                of the appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge had submitted a written notice to the NEB indicating
                that it had appointed an Accountable Officer. In its submission,
                Enbridge confirmed that its Accountable Officer had authority
                over the human and financial resources required to meet the
                Board’s substantive expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided by Enbridge, the Board has not
                identified any non-compliance issues. The Board has therefore
                assessed this sub-element as Compliant.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 - Policy and Commitment Statements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have documented policies and goals to ensure the
                safety and security of the public, workers, and the pipeline and
                ensure protection of property and the environment. Further, as
                these policies and goals are to be used to establish and
                implement the management and programs, the Board requires that
                the policies and goals be explicit from the perspective of
                design, content and communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had corporate and program level
                policies and goals that related to the Emergency Management
                program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the many policies, processes, principles,
                programs and initiatives that Enbridge had developed to direct
                and support its Emergency Management program, the Board
                identified non-compliance in the Policy and Commitment
                Statements sub-element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge did not demonstrate that it had a policy that
                explicitly describes internal reporting of hazards, potential
                hazards, incidents and near misses and describes the conditions
                under which a person making a report will be granted immunity
                from disciplinary action.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and the Emergency Management program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;2.0 - Planning</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.1 - Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment
                and Control
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential
                hazards, assessing the degree of risk associated with the
                hazards, and implementing control measures to minimize or
                eliminate risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed a governance
                management system process for identifying, evaluating and
                managing its hazards and risks; however, the Board also found
                that this governance level management system process did not
                meet the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the program level, Enbridge’s hazard
                identification practices were considered to be simplistic and
                did not reflect common hazard identification practices.
                Enbridge’s identification of a singular hazard approach combined
                with its corporately focused and undemonstrated risk evaluation
                practices is considered to be a foundational issue with respect
                to developing a management system driven emergency management
                program. The Board has found that Enbridge has not developed the
                OPR required sequential stepped-approach of hazard and potential
                hazard identification, evaluation of risk and determination of
                controls.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had not developed a program level
                risk evaluation process that addressed the OPR requirements.
                During the audit Enbridge provided two documented processes as
                its Emergency Management program level risk evaluation
                processes. The Board found that the processes, alone or
                together, did not meet the OPR requirements as one focused on
                corporate risk and the other was applicable only to specific
                activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had not established and
                implemented a documented management system process to develop
                and implement controls to prevent, manage and mitigate its
                identified hazards and risks as part of its Emergency Management
                program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of the lack of a compliant process for developing
                controls, the Board found that Enbridge had established and
                implemented emergency management related controls and control
                practices such as the development of emergency response plans,
                tactical plans, pre-identification of control points and
                acquisition and placement of emergency response. The Board found
                that the controls had been developed based on standard industry
                practices, input from its and other emergency response personnel
                and knowledge gathered during its exercise activities and past
                responses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 - Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and monitoring compliance with all legal
                requirements applicable to the company. The company must also
                maintain a list of the legal requirements that apply to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed management system
                and program level processes for identifying and monitoring its
                legal requirements. The management system level process included
                requirements for development of compliance registers at both
                levels. The Board found that Enbridge’s management system level
                processes and compliance registers did not meet the OPR
                requirements with respect to design and content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.3 - Goals, Objectives and Targets</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for developing and setting goals, objectives and
                specific targets for the risks and hazards associated with the
                company’s facilities and activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at both the management system and program
                levels, Enbridge had established and implemented a process that
                meets the Board’s requirements for establishing goals,
                objectives, targets and performance measures.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, although Enbridge had established and
                implemented a process for developing and setting, goals,
                objectives and targets, Enbridge did not demonstrate that it had
                established explicit goals related to its OPR section&nbsp;6
                obligations for it to base its management system and Emergency
                Management program on and as required by OPR, section&nbsp;6.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management System
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

                Responsibilities
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have a documented organizational structure that
                enables it to meet the requirements of its management system.
                The company must also complete an annual documented evaluation
                to demonstrate that there is adequate human resourcing to meet
                these obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had a documented organizational
                structure and communicates the roles responsibilities and
                authorities of the officers and employees at all levels of the
                company. Additionally, the Board found that Enbridge had adopted
                ICS that establishes a proven incident response organizational
                structure with documented roles and responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and implemented
                several mechanisms for reviewing its emergency management
                program human resourcing needs. The Board, however, found
                deficiencies with Enbridge’s developed evaluation of need
                practices. Specifically, the Board also found that Enbridge’s
                evaluation of need practices did not specifically account for
                staff with emergency management responsibilities outside of the
                Emergency and Security department. Further, Enbridge did not
                demonstrate that it had documented an evaluation of the human
                resource needs required during an actual response.
              </p>
              <p>

                only abnormal or upset operations. This section is therefore
                considered not to apply in this audit. The review of Enbridge’s
                controls is documented in sub-element&nbsp;3.2, below.

              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;3.2 - Operational Control-Upset or Abnormal
                Operating Conditions
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states the company
                shall establish and maintain plans and procedures to identify
                the potential for upset or abnormal operating conditions,
                accidental releases, incidents and emergency situations. The
                company shall also define proposed responses to these events and
                prevent and mitigate the likely consequence and/or impacts of
                these events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on interviews, and document and record reviews, the Board
                found that Enbridge demonstrated that it had numerous controls
                for its emergency program such as emergency response plans,
                tactical plans, tank fire plans etc. The Board found that
                Enbridge had developed its controls (plans, equipment etc.)
                based on industry practices, input from emergency response
                personnel expertise and experience with historical events.
                Further, the Board found that Enbridge has demonstrated that it
                had dedicated significant resources to acquiring equipment for
                emergency response and had also established agreements with
                response specialists and other industry organizations for
                emergency response preparedness and response activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge developed controls that, based on
                the Board’s assessment, correspond to its hazards, risks,
                activities and locations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board reviewed Enbridge’s Emergency Procedures manuals, as
                submitted to the Board, and has found deficiencies that Enbridge
                has agreed to rectify by 31&nbsp;January 2015.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Enbridge has not utilized a sequential
                stepped approach for hazard and potential hazard identification,
                evaluation of risk and determination of controls. The Board
                further found that, in the absence of a compliant controls
                development and associated hazard and risk identification and
                evaluation processes, Enbridge could not formally demonstrate or
                verify that its existing controls were adequate or, in the case
                of equipment and associated human resources, located in
                appropriate locations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and implemented
                ICS (Incident Command Structure) as its standard process for
                coordinating, controlling and managing the response activities
                of employees and other people working with or on behalf of the
                company during an incident.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and the Emergency Management program against the requirements,
                the Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective
                actions to address the described deficiencies.

              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.3 - Management of Change</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and managing any change that could
                affect safety, security or protection of the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge was in the process of establishing
                an updated management system management of change process. The
                Board found that this process did not meet the OPR requirements
                with respect to design, content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the program level, Enbridge had
                implemented a number of practices for management of change
                applicable to its Emergency Management program. The Board found
                that these practices did not meet all of the OPR requirements
                with respect to applicability and design.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for developing competency requirements and training
                programs for its employees and contractors. These competency
                requirements and training programs must enable employees and
                contractors to perform their duties in a manner that is safe,
                ensures the security of the pipeline, and protects the
                environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and implemented a
                training program for its employees and contractors. The Board
                also found that, while Enbridge had implemented some practices
                for reviewing the competencies of its workers, it had not
                established and implemented processes consistent with the
                requirements of OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that it brought this deficiency to Enbridge’s
                attention early in its audit process as a matter requiring
                urgent attention. Enbridge responded by developing a documented
                process that it provided to the Board’s auditors prior to the
                close-out of the field activities. Due to the early stage of
                development and implementation, Enbridge could not demonstrate
                the adequacy, effectiveness, establishment and implementation of
                the new process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.5 - Communication</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for internally and externally communicating safety,
                security and Emergency Management information.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge communicated internally and
                externally with respect to its emergency management program
                throughout its organization as a matter of practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established a number of formal
                practices and methodologies to communicate and manage its
                communication during an emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge had not established or
                implemented a communication process that meets the Board’s
                management system process requirements. Additionally, the Board
                found deficiencies relating to Enbridge’s Continuing Education
                and Liaison requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.6 - Documentation and Document Control</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and managing the documents required to
                meet the company’s obligations for conducting activities in a
                manner that ensures the safety and security of the public,
                company employees and the pipeline, and that protects property
                and the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the program level, Enbridge
                demonstrated that it had developed document control lists and
                procedures and practices for managing and controlling its
                Emergency Management program documents that address many of the
                OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, at the governance level, Enbridge had
                developed its new IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.9
                <em>Governance Document Control Process</em>, dated
                22&nbsp;August 2014. However, Enbridge did not demonstrate that
                this process met the OPR requirements or had been established
                and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge did not demonstrate that it
                had implemented a process for identifying the documents required
                for the company to meet its obligations under section&nbsp;6 and
                as required by OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>n</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system

              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must establish and implement an effective process for
                inspecting and monitoring its activities and facilities. This is
                so that the company can evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness
                of the protection programs and take corrective and preventive
                actions if deficiencies are identified.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit sub-element also requires the company to have an
                effective process for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the company’s

                </li>
                <li>
                  Monitoring, measuring and documenting the company’s
                  performance in meeting its obligations; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using an effective data management system to monitor and
                  analyze the trends in hazards, incidents and near-misses.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board found that, at the program level, Enbridge’s Emergency
                Management department had processes for inspecting, monitoring
                and testing its emergency management program components.
                However, the Board found that Enbridge could not demonstrate
                that it had established and implemented governance management
                system processes that meet the requirements of the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of its review of this sub-element the Board conducted an
                evaluation of Enbridge’s management system and program level
                processes for taking corrective and preventive actions. The
                Board found that Enbridge had not established and implemented a
                management system process for taking corrective and preventive
                actions at both the management system and program levels that
                meets the OPR requirements. The Board notes that the requirement
                to have a process to take corrective and preventive action is
                included in many of the sub-elements within the Board’s audit
                protocol and the OPR. The Board therefore requires the
                corrective action plan developed to address the deficiencies
                identified for this sub-element to explicitly include all
                sub-element and OPR requirements, where corrective and
                preventive actions are referenced.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and implemented an
                emergency management exercise program to test and monitor it
                emergency response planning and capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has established and implemented a
                data management system that meets the Board’s requirements and
                provides a program level process to ensure that any corrective
                and preventive actions resulting from its emergency management
                testing and monitoring processes are appropriately managed.
              </p>

                and for taking corrective and preventive actions to address
                them. This includes investigating if the hazards, potential
                hazards, incidents and near-misses have or could have resulted
                in the safety and security of the public, employees and the
                pipeline, and protection of property and the environment. This
                sub-element also requires a company to have an established,
                maintained and effective data management system for monitoring
                and analyzing the trends in hazards, incidents and near-misses.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, at the governance level, Enbridge’s
                IMS-01, section&nbsp;4.10 Event Investigation Processes, dated
                11-December 2013 had been documented and included in its
                Governing Policies and Processes Management System manual and
                that key activities were being implemented within its programs.
                These processes were, however, identified as “In Progress” and
                therefore not established and implemented.

                program. However, the Board found, however, that Enbridge had
                not organized the quality assurance activities within a program
                as required by the OPR.
              </p>

                requirements of section&nbsp;55 of the OPR. The Board also found
                that Enbridge had not undertaken an audit consistent with
                section&nbsp;53 of the OPR. The Board noted that Enbridge had
                already developed a Board approved corrective action plan for
                this issue as part of its section&nbsp;55 audit activities. The
                corrective action is scheduled to be completed by
                31&nbsp;December 2016.
              </p>
              <p>
                With respect to developing a process for conducting audits as
                required by OPR section&nbsp;53, Enbridge indicated that it
                utilized a combination of a number of different methods to meet
                these requirements. Upon reviewing the overall and individual
                processes and practices the Board found that they do not meet
                the OPR requirements by design and practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of its review of this sub-element the Board conducted an
                evaluation of Enbridge’s management system and program level
                processes for taking corrective and preventive actions. The
                Board found that Enbridge had not established and implemented a
                management system process for taking corrective and preventive
                actions at both the management system and program levels that
                meets the OPR requirements. The Board notes that the requirement
                to have a process to take corrective and preventive action is
                included in many of the sub-elements within the Board’s audit
                protocol and the OPR. The Board therefore requires the
                corrective action plan developed to address the deficiencies
                identified for this sub-element to explicitly include all
                sub-element and OPR requirements, where corrective and
                preventive actions are referenced.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.4 - Records Management</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element states that a company must establish and
                implement an effective process for generating, retaining, and
                maintaining records that document the implementation of the
                management system and its protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed a draft governance
                Records Management Process as part of it Integrated Management
                System. The Board also found that, due to the draft nature of
                the process, Enbridge did not demonstrate that it had
                established and implemented a management system process that
                meets the OPR requirements.'
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that, regardless of the establishment of
                its management system process, Enbridge had implemented a
                consistent records management practice for application across
                its organization. At the Emergency Management program level the
                Board found record management process deficiencies with respect
                to the design and implementation in some of the document and
                records reviewed.'
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;5.0 - Management Review</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;5.1 - Management Review</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element states that a company must establish and
                implement an effective process for conducting an annual
                management review of the management system and each protection
                program and for ensuring continual improvement in meeting the
                company’s obligations. This sub-element also requires a company
                to complete an annual report for the previous calendar year,
                signed by the accountable officer, describing the performance of
                the company’s management system in meeting its obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and implemented
                processes to address the stated requirements and had undertaken
                the activities associated with its processes. The Board also
                found, however, that Enbridge’s processes did not fully meet all
                of the OPR requirements. As a result the management reviews
                completed by Enbridge were also found to be non-compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the Board found that some of the Non-Compliant
                findings made in this audit fall within the responsibility and
                accountability of Enbridge’s senior management. These relate to
                direction, management and oversight and, as such, have
                contributed to the Non-compliant finding for this element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Emergency Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <h2 id="s11">11.0 Conclusions</h2>
              <p>
                Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive
                commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and
                environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s
                regulation must establish and implement effective management
                systems and incorporate Emergency Management programs into their
                day-to-day operations. These programs must ensure that pipelines
                are operated in a manner that protects the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this audit Enbridge was required to demonstrate the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its management system and
                Emergency Management program to the Board. The Board reviewed
                documentation and records provided by Enbridge, conducted
                inspections and interviewed Enbridge staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on its review, the Board found that Enbridge was in a
                transitory period in terms of establishing and implementing its
                management system. Additionally, the Board’s audit found that
                some of Enbridge’s management system processes were not designed
                or established and implemented in a manner that allowed its
                management system to meet the requirements of OPR
                section&nbsp;6.1. Consequently, the Board has found that
                Enbridge’s management system is Non-Compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Enbridge’s Emergency Management program
                reflected the transitory nature of Enbridge’s management system
                and process issues as noted. The Board’s audit found, however,
                and most importantly, that, regardless of the design and
                implementation status of its management system, Enbridge’s
                Emergency Management program and the processes and practices
                being used, identified and controlled the majority and most
                significant of the company’s emergency management related
                hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In analyzing Enbridge’s Non-Compliant findings the Board has
                found that most of them fall into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Enbridge’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the majority of all of the Non-Compliant
                findings made by the Board relate to management system process
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that while no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address these non-compliant findings, as
                per the Board’s standard audit practice, Enbridge must develop
                and submit a corrective action plan describing its proposed
                methods to resolve the non-compliances identified and the
                timeline in which corrective actions will be completed. Enbridge
                will be required to submit its corrective action plan for
                approval within 30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report being
                issued by the Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of Enbridge’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of Enbridge’s Emergency
                Management program and management system as a whole through
                targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
                ongoing regulatory mandate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make its final Audit Report and Enbridge’s
                approved corrective action plan public on the Board’s website.

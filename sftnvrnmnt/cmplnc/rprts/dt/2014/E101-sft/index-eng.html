              <p>
                The Board has completed its Final Report for its audit of
                Enbridge’s Safety Management Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Draft Report documenting the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s
                Safety Management Program was provided to Enbridge on
                4&nbsp;February 2015 for review and comment. On 6&nbsp;March
                2015, Enbridge submitted its response.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has considered Enbridge’s comments and has made
                changes to the Final Audit Report and its Appendices as it
                determined to be appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of
                whether Enbridge was compliant with the regulatory requirements
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enbridge’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Enbridge was required to demonstrate the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the methods selected and employed within its
                Programs to meet the regulatory requirements listed above.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has enclosed the Final Audit Report and associated
                appendices with this letter. The Board will make the Final Audit
                Report public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the issuance of the Final Audit Report by
                the Board, Enbridge is required to file a Corrective Action Plan
                (CAP), which describes the methods and timing for addressing the
                Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for
                approval.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the CAP public and will continue to monitor
                and assess all of Enbridge’s corrective actions with respect to
                this audit until they are fully implemented. The Board will also
                continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                Enbridge’s Safety Management Program and management system
                through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of
                its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and environmental protection.
                Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to
                incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations. These systems and
                associated technical management programs include the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure NEB regulated
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. In the public
                interest, the Board holds companies accountable for safety and
                environmental outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s comprehensive audit of
                Enbridge’s management system and Safety Management program
                applicable to its facilities that are regulated by the NEB. The
                audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. This amendment clarified
                the Board’s expectations for establishing and implementing a
                documented management system and Safety Management program.
                Before issuing the amendment, the Board consulted and
                communicated with its regulated companies with respect to the
                new requirements; therefore, an implementation grace period was
                not given when the OPR was promulgated. As a result, when
                evaluating compliance, this audit did not consider any extra
                time Enbridge may have needed to implement changes associated
                with the formalized management system requirements. As indicated
                in the amendments, companies must have an effective and
                well-documented Safety Management program as a key component of
                their management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit following its published audit
                protocol, which identifies five management system elements.
                These five&nbsp;elements are broken into 17&nbsp;sub-elements.
                Each sub-element reflects several regulatory requirements.
                Companies must comply with 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
                regulatory requirements of each sub-element being assessed. If a
                company’s program is found to be deficient with respect to any
                regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element will be found
                Non-Compliant. This report also includes an assessment of
                Enbridge’s management system against the requirements of OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Enbridge’s regulated facilities found that
                Enbridge is in the process of establishing and implementing a
                management system that reflects its commitment to applying a
                formal management structure to all of its business functions and
                departments. Enbridge has not limited its management system to
                the technical programs required by the Board and was 
                implementing a corporate management system, not merely an
                operations management system as many companies have done in
                response to the Board’s regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that Enbridge’s records indicate that it started
                developing its management system after the Board’s Integrity
                Management and Safety Management program audits in 2009. This
                was before Enbridge was notified of the intended OPR changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of when Enbridge started its management system
                development, its commitment to establishing and implementing a
                corporate management system for all of its Board regulated
                business and facilities is a large, complex undertaking. The
                Board therefore identified that Enbridge’s management system is
                in a transitory state between the program-based management
                practices it used in the past and its new management system
                approach. This has contributed to a Non-Compliant finding
                related to establishing and implementing a compliant management
                system. It is important to understand that the Board’s finding
                regarding Enbridge’s management system primarily reflects the
                company’s stage in developing and applying its management
                system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of technical
                management activities being undertaken to ensure the safety of
                the pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Enbridge’s management system included an
                assessment of the individual management system processes as
                described in the OPR and the Board’s audit protocol. As
                documented in this report, the Board found that Enbridge has
                documented many of the required processes within its Integrated
                Management System. However, the Board found that some of
                Enbridge’s management system processes were not sufficiently
                systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive to meet the
                OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that, regardless of the reasons for
                non-compliance, companies were required to be compliant with the
                Board’s management system requirements when the OPR was updated
                in 2013. Enbridge will need to develop and implement corrective
                actions to ensure establishment and implementation of its
                management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to evaluating Enbridge’s management system and
                associated processes, the Board’s audit also included an
                evaluation of Enbridge’s Safety Management program to determine
                the applicability and integration of the management system
                within it and to assess whether Enbridge is meeting its
                requirements to develop, implement and maintain an safety
                management protection program that anticipates, prevents,
                manages and mitigates potentially dangerous conditions and
                exposure to those conditions during all activities relating to
                construction, operation, maintenance, abandonment and emergency
                situations. The Board found that, notwithstanding the
                documentation issues relating to its management system
                processes, the processes and practices presently used by
                Enbridge identified the majority, and most significant, of its
                safety related hazards and that Enbridge has developed and
                implemented operational controls and inspection and monitoring
                programs to address these hazards. The Board notes that
                Enbridge’s Safety Management program has been in existence for
                many years, thus its safety related practices and procedures are
                well established within the organization. The Board did identify
                some deficiencies not related to management system process
                development. All of the Board’s findings are documented in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-sft/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a

                of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                In analyzing the results of its audit as a whole, the Board
                notes that it has made a significant number of Non-Compliant
                findings.The majority of these findings fall into three general
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Enbridge’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the majority of all of the Non-Compliant
                findings made by the Board relate to management system process
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that enforcement actions are not
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within&nbsp;30 days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Enbridge must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval. The Corrective Action
                Plan must detail how Enbridge intends to resolve the
                non-compliances identified by this audit. The Board will assess
                implementation of the corrective actions to confirm they are
                completed in a timely manner and applied consistently across
                Enbridge’s regulated system. The Board will also continue to
                monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of
                Enbridge’s management system and Safety Management program
                through targeted compliance verification activities as part of
                its ongoing regulatory mandate.

                <strong>Adequate: </strong>The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses
                the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains
                the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff have been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent
                basis”,  the Board requires the requirement to be implemented,
                meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements
                of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> and its associated
                regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff have been
                trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff
                and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated
                use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews
                have provided evidence of full implementation of the
                requirement, as prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are
                not partially utilized).

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>o</em>). With records, the
                company must demonstrate that it meets the records management
                requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>p</em>).

                <strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR
                sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach
                designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote
                continual improvement. The system includes the organizational
                structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and
                procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations
                related to safety, security and environmental protection.

                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has

                  >OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) describes the Board’s required
                  management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                  management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                  process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                  developed or maintained as described within each section;
                  whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                  designed to address the requirements of the process, for
                  example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards
                  and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit
                  required actions including roles, responsibilities and
                  authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing
                  the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common
                  5 w’s and h approach (who, what, where, when, why and how).
                  The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have multiple
                  requirements; companies may therefore establish and implement
                  multiple processes, as long as they are designed to meet the
                  legal requirements and integrate any processes linkages
                  contemplated by the OPR section. Processes must incorporate or
                  contain linkage to procedures, where required to meet the
                  process requirements.</em

                  >As the processes constitute part of the management system,
                  the required processes must be developed in a manner that
                  allows them to function as part of the system. The required
                  management system is described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The
                  processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the
                  company following its policies and goals established and
                  required by section&nbsp;6.3.</em

                  >Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each process
                  must be part of the management system and the programs
                  referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be
                  compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which
                  considers the specific technical requirements associated with
                  each program <strong>and</strong> is applied to and meets the
                  process requirements within each program. The Board recognizes
                  that single process may not meet all of the programs; in these
                  cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as
                  long as they meet the process requirements (as described
                  above) and direct the program processes to be established and
                  implemented in a consistent manner that allows for the
                  management system to function as described in 6.1.</em

              <h2 id="s3">3.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection
                of the environment, the Board has developed regulations
                requiring companies to establish and implement documented
                management systems applicable to specified technical management
                and protection programs. These management systems and programs
                must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the
                NEB Act and its associated regulations, as well as the
                <em>Canada Labour Code</em> (CLC). The Board’s management system
                requirements are described within OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1
                through&nbsp;6.6.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the audit, the Board reviews the compliance and
                incident history of the company as recorded in NEB files. This
                helps the Board determine the appropriate scope for the audit.
                During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and samples
                records provided by the company in its demonstration of
                compliance and interviews corporate and regionally-based staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also conducts separate but linked technical
                inspections of a representative sample of company facilities.
                This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness
                and implementation of the management system and programs. The
                Board bases the scope and location of the inspections on the
                needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard
                inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the
                audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If
                unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an
                inspection, they are actioned as set out by the Board’s standard
                inspection and enforcement practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines the
                Board’s audit activities, provides evaluations of the company’s
                management system and programs, identifies deficiencies and
                communicates compliance findings. The audit report follows the
                format of the Board’s published Audit Protocol. Once the Board
                issues the Final Audit Report, the company must submit and
                implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all Non-Compliant
                findings. Final Audit Reports are published on the Board’s
                website. The audit results are integrated into NEB’s
                risk-informed lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.

              <h2 id="s4">4.0 Background</h2>
              <p>
                Enbridge operates approximately 10,733 km of pipeline in six
                Canadian provinces and territories. These pipeline facilities
                include pump stations, tankage and associated operational
                assets. All of these facilities are within the definition of a
                “pipeline” as included in the NEB Act. Enbridge also has a
                considerable amount of non-federally regulated infrastructure in
                Alberta and across the United States, which complete its North
                American system. Enbridge’s system allows it to transport
                liquids from northern and western Canada to end-users in the
                Eastern regions of Canada and the United States. In order for
                Enbridge to operate its pipelines effectively, it has developed
                a management structure that reflects its safety and security
                management, and environmental obligations, as well as its
                corporate, national, regional and international needs. Enbridge
                Pipelines Inc. controls and uses several entities that hold
                NEB-issued certificates for operating in Canada. The entities
                included within the scope of this audit are identified in
                Section&nbsp;5.0, Audit Objectives and Scope of this report.
              </p>
              <p>
                During audit planning, company staff indicated that Enbridge and
                its subsidiaries operate the pipelines and facilities using a
                common management system and technical programs. In order to
                effectively evaluate compliance of such an expansive system
                within a reasonable timeframe, the Board chose to conduct
                individual, comprehensive audits of Enbridge’s required
                technical programs and management system. This report documents
                one of six management system and program audits. The audits are
                titled:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Enbridge Integrity Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Safety Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Enbridge Environmental Protection Program Audit;</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Emergency Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>Enbridge Third-Party Crossings Program Audit; and</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Enbridge Public Awareness Program Audit.</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Audit results confirmed that Enbridge operates its facilities
                using a common organizational structure to implement a common
                governance management system that applies to all of its business
                and operational activities. Some findings are therefore similar
                in each audit and the individual audit reports reflect this.

              <h2 id="s5">5.0 Audit Objectives and Scope</h2>
              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to determine the establishment
                and implementation of Enbridge’s management system, and the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its Safety Management program.
                Enbridge was audited against the requirements contained within
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enbridge’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April 2013. This amendment clarified
                the Board’s expectations for establishing and implementing a
                documented management system and Safety Management program.
                Before issuing the amendment, the Board consulted and
                communicated with its regulated companies with respect to the
                new requirements; therefore, an implementation grace period was
                not given when the OPR was promulgated. As a result, when
                evaluating compliance, this audit did not consider any extra
                time Enbridge may have needed to implement changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Section&nbsp;47 of the OPR indicates that regulated companies
                “shall develop, implement and maintain a safety management
                program that anticipates, prevents, manages and mitigates
                potentially dangerous conditions and exposure to those
                conditions during all activities relating to construction,
                operation, maintenance, abandonment and emergency situations.”
                However, the Board notes that construction and abandonment
                activities are usually regulated and managed through practices
                and programs developed and approved for each project or
                application. Using this audit to evaluate the application of the
                program and practices for managing activities that have not been
                fully described and approved would be neither efficient nor in
                the interest of Canadians. The Board has therefore not included
                construction and abandonment activities in the scope of this
                audit. The Board will evaluate these program requirements during
                separate Board compliance assurance activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. companies hold a number of
                certificates to operate in Canada. The Board has included the
                following companies within the scope of this audit:

              <p>
                In undertaking this audit, the Board has applied its standard
                audit practice following its published protocols. The Board’s
                standard practice and audit activities include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Formal notification of the Board’s intent to audit by letter;

              </ul>
              <p>
                These audit activities allow the company to demonstrate whether
                its management system and programs comply. They also allow the
                Board to evaluate the company with respect to: assuring
                compliance to regulatory requirements; and assuring appropriate
                safety, security and environmental outcomes as described in OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. operates an expansive liquids
                pipeline system using a common management system and Safety
                Management program. Furthermore, Enbridge divides its Canadian
                assets into five operational regions: Northern Region, Western
                Region, Central Region, Southern Prairie Region and Eastern
                Region. The Board therefore developed its audit plan to evaluate
                Enbridge’s management system and Safety Management program and
                to assure that it was appropriate to manage and applied to all
                of its regulated facilities regardless of location. To this end,
                the Board conducted interviews, inspections and documentation
                and record reviews in each region as well as the Edmonton
                 office. It is the Board’s expectation that any audit
                Non-Compliant findings made and corrective actions required by
                the Board must be applied across all of Enbridge’s Board
                regulated systems and subsidiaries.

              <p>
                The Board informed Enbridge Pipelines Inc. of its intent to
                audit its NEB regulated facilities in a letter dated 19 December
                2013. Following the issuance of that letter, Board audit staff
                met with Enbridge staff on a regular basis to arrange and
                coordinate this audit. The Board also provided Enbridge with an
                information guidance document to help Enbridge prepare for the
                audit, and provide access to documentation and records to
                demonstrate its compliance. Enbridge established a digital
                access portal for Board staff to review documentation and
                records.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 5&nbsp;May 2014, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from Enbridge in Edmonton, Alberta to confirm
                the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. The opening
                meeting was followed by Edmonton office interviews from 5 to
                16&nbsp;May 2014, and various field level audit activities as
                described in the table below. Throughout the audit, Board audit
                staff gave Enbridge daily summaries with action items, where
                required.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 21 and 22&nbsp;October 2014, the Board held an audit
                pre-close-out meeting with Enbridge. At this meeting Board staff
                and Enbridge staff discussed potential deficiencies identified
                during field activities and discussed additional information
                that could be of value to the Board prior to compiling its draft
                audit report. An audit close-out meeting was held on
                17&nbsp;December 2014 to provide Enbridge with a description of
                the recommendations that staff would be bringing to the Board
                for decision.

              <p>
                OPR, section&nbsp;6.1 outlines the Board’s management system
                requirements as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                A company shall establish, implement and maintain a management
                system that
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
                <li>
                  (<em>a</em>) is systematic, explicit, comprehensive and
                  proactive;
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>b</em>) integrates the company’s operational activities
                  and technical systems with its management of human and
                  financial resources to enable the company to meet its
                  obligations under section&nbsp;6;
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>c</em>) applies to all the company’s activities involving
                  the design, construction, operation or abandonment of a
                  pipeline and to the programs referred to in section&nbsp;55;
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>d</em>) ensures coordination between the programs
                  referred to in section&nbsp;55; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  (<em>e</em>) corresponds to the size of the company, to the
                  scope, nature and complexity of its activities and to the
                  hazards and risks associated with those activities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In assessing Enbridge’s management system the Board applied the
                definitions and guidance as described in Section&nbsp;1.0 Audit
                Terminology and Definitions of this report. The Board’s audit
                results indicated that Enbridge was in the process of
                establishing and implementing a management system that reflects
                its commitment to applying a formal management structure to all
                of its regulated business operations. Enbridge has not limited
                its management system to the technical programs required by the
                Board. The company is committed to implementing a corporate
                management system and not merely an operations management system
                as many companies do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge’s records indicate that it started developing its
                management system after the Board’s Integrity Management and
                Safety Management program audits in 2009 and prior to the
                Board’s identification of its intended OPR changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of when Enbridge started its management system
                development, establishing a corporate management system
                applicable to all of its business and facilities is a large,
                complex undertaking. The Board’s audit therefore identified that
                Enbridge’s management system was in a transitory state between
                the program-based management practices it used in the past and
                its new management system approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                In determining Enbridge’s compliance with respect to
                establishing and implementing a management system, the Board
                reviewed the audit results of Enbridge’s Safety Management
                program processes along with the audit results of other Board
                program audits completed concurrently. This aided the Board in
                evaluating Enbridge’s systematic practices and deficiencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has not met the requirements for
                establishing and implementing a management system. For the most
                part, this reflected the transitory nature of its management
                system as applied to the Safety Management program. The issues
                related to designing and establishing processes as described
                below and in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-sft/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                also contributed to the Board’s Non-Compliant finding. This is
                especially true with respect to Enbridge’s Quality Assurance
                Program and auditing process design.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that it is important to understand that the
                Board’s management system Non-Compliant finding reflects the
                company’s stage in developing and applying its management
                system. It does not necessarily reflect the lack of technical
                management activities being undertaken to ensure the safety.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that, regardless of the reasons for
                non-compliance, companies were required to be compliant with the
                Board’s management system requirements when the OPR was updated
                in 2013. Enbridge will need to develop and implement corrective
                actions to ensure establishment and implementation of its
                management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has further detailed its evaluation below in order for
                Enbridge to understand the nature of the Board’s management
                system finding to aid in development of its Corrective Action
                Plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found Enbridge Non-Compliant with OPR,
                section&nbsp;6.1(<em>a</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                This section requires management systems to be systematic,
                explicit, comprehensive and proactive. Enbridge’s documentation
                that describes its governance management system requirements
                clearly stated that the company’s management system is intended
                to meet these outcomes. The Board’s audit determined that
                Enbridge’s management system did meet the requirements for to
                being systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive at an
                over-arching, system design level. However, as described below,
                the design of its processes, interpretation of some of the OPR
                requirements, lack of clarity with respect to some of the
                specific requirements, such as OPR section&nbsp;6.3(<em>a</em>)
                and (<em>b</em>) policies and goals and its definition of risks
                vs hazards, did not meet the OPR requirements. This resulted in
                the Board determining that the present management system
                processes will not ensure that the company’s management system
                is systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive throughout
                all levels of the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge’s governance processes for their
                management system aligned with most of the Board’s process
                requirements by description. However, as described in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-sft/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >, there were issues associated with many of Enbridge’s
                processes. Enbridge has not designed all of its processes in a
                way that ensures the OPR process requirements are consistently
                met at the management system and program level. For example, the
                Board found that many of the processes did not include clear
                links to or include tier 2 and 3 procedures where inclusion
                would ensure appropriate or consistent implementation of the
                processes at the program level. This has led to some of the
                company’s processes being comprised of commitment statements
                rather than activity descriptions. Additionally, many of the
                company’s documented processes lacked full descriptions of the
                input and output processes and the products associated with each
                process. The Board found that Enbridge generally mitigated these
                process design deficiencies from a safety perspective; however,
                this was accomplished by program-level management practices and
                procedures. As well, Board documentation and record reviews and
                interviews with staff responsible for developing processes or
                programs indicated that many of the missing process components
                were actually being done by practice but have not been
                documented in Enbridge’s management system processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of Enbridge’s Corrective Action Plan to address its
                management system Non-Compliant finding, the Board is of the
                view that, Enbridge must develop and implement a compliant
                document control processes that meet OPR requirements for all
                new and existing documents in the company’s management system.
                This will serve to assure that the management system processes
                are designed appropriately and that existing or referenced
                documents fully meet the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing Non-Compliant findings across the programs being
                audited concurrently by the Board, it is noted that several of
                the Non-Compliant findings related to Enbridge’s interpretation
                of OPR requirements. Enbridge provided specific information with
                respect to these interpretations during the audit. The Board
                notes that all regulations are subject to interpretation;
                however, many of Enbridge’s interpretations in this category did
                not reflect the wording of the regulations or standard
                management system practices. Examples of Enbridge’s
                interpretation issues can be found in the Board’s evaluation of
                the company’s quality assurance program, auditing, hazard
                identification and management of change processes, all of which
                are outlined in
                <a
                  href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2014/E101-sft/nnx-i-eng.html"
                  >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
                >
                of this document.
              </p>
              <p>
                During its audit, the Board noted that Enbridge colour coded
                some process steps red in its governance process diagrams.
                According to the legend provided, red indicated that the process
                step should be considered aspirational. When interviewed,
                Enbridge staff indicated that aspirational refers to steps
                considered above regulatory requirements.. The Board has given
                Enbridge and its regulated industry consistent information with
                respect to aspirational management practices. If a company
                identifies a practice as “above regulatory requirements,
                aspirational or stretch”, the Board will not hold that company
                accountable for implementing the practice as per OPR,
                section&nbsp;4. This is to allow and encourage companies to
                include aspirational goals or practices in their overall
                management practices without fear of non-compliance when
                aspirational goals are not met. The Board found that some of the
                process steps Enbridge identified as aspirational were actually
                legally required. Examples of this included steps for
                identifying and verifying competencies in Enbridge’s IMS 01,
                4.14 Workforce Competency and Qualification Process.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of the comments above contribute to the Board’s
                Non-Compliant finding with respect to OPR
                section&nbsp;6.1(<em>a</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information from Enbridge and interviews with its
                staff, the Board’s audit did not identify any non-compliant
                issues related to OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1(<em>b</em>) through
                (<em>e</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                against the OPR requirements, the Board has determined that
                Enbridge is Non-Compliant with section&nbsp;6.1. Enbridge will
                have to develop a Corrective Action Plan to address the
                described deficiencies.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate safety management programs into their
                day-to-day operations. These programs must include the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure that workers are safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit Enbridge indicated that the Board’s Safety
                Management program requirements correspond to the company’s
                Safety Management System. The Board identified that Enbridge’s
                Safety Management System (IMS- 04) is one of 19&nbsp;management
                systems included in Enbridge’s Integrated Management System
                (IMS). Further review of Enbridge’s IMS indicated that it is
                actually comprised of 17&nbsp;subordinate management systems,
                governed by two governance management systems, IMS - 01,
                Governing Policies and Processes Management System and IMS - 02,
                Compliance and Ethics Management System. These governance
                management systems outline minimum corporate requirements to be
                incorporated into each sub-ordinate management system of which
                IMS-04 is one. As noted previously in section&nbsp;8.0 of this
                report, at the time of the audit the Board found that Enbridge
                has not yet established and implemented its required management
                system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has identified that primary responsibility for
                Enbridge’s Safety Management program resides within its Safety
                Management department.  This department is comprised of subject
                matter experts who are responsible for providing safety
                leadership, promotion and direction in organizational activities
                through management system development and maintenance,
                stewardship, technical knowledge and support for Enbridge
                employees and contractors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board identified that responsibility for implementation of
                the Safety Management program resides with a number Enbridge’s
                functional departments. The Board therefore considered the sum
                of the Safety Management department and all other departments’
                safety related responsibilities as comprising the Safety
                Management program for the purposes of this audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to the transitory nature of Enbridge’s corporate management
                system, the Board found that Enbridge’s Safety Management
                program framework was comprised of a mix of Safety Management
                System processes and historically established and implemented
                processes and practices. It was noted during the audit that this
                transition has created gaps in continuity and consistency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that the processes presently used by Enbridge
                identified the majority, and most significant, of its hazards
                and that Enbridge has developed and implemented the operational
                controls and inspection and monitoring programs to address these
                hazards. The Board also found that Enbridge’s Safety Management
                program has been in existence for many years, thus the safety
                related practices and procedures are well established within the
                organization. Notwithstanding these practices and procedures,
                the audit identified several non-compliant findings. The
                majority of the findings fall into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Enbridge’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30 days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, Enbridge must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval detailing how it
                intends to resolve Non-Compliances identified by this audit. The
                Board will assess the implementation of the corrective actions
                to confirm that they are completed in an expedient manner, and
                on a system-wide basis. The Board will also continue to monitor
                the overall implementation and effectiveness of Enbridge’s
                management system and Safety Management program through targeted
                compliance verification activities as a part of its on-going
                regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies five Management System elements. These
                five&nbsp;elements are further broken down into
                17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each sub-element reflects a number of
                regulatory requirements. The NEB requires companies to be
                compliant with one hundred percent of the regulatory
                requirements of each of the Management System sub-elements being
                assessed. If a company’s program is found to be deficient with
                respect to any regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element
                will be found in Non-Compliance. A Corrective Action Plan will
                be required in order to demonstrate to the Board that
                appropriate actions will be taken to achieve full compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following summary represents a high-level overview of the
                Board’s audit findings for Enbridge’s Safety Management program
                based on information provided for the audit.

              <h3>Element&nbsp;1.0 - Policy and Commitment</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 - Leadership and Accountability</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must appoint an Accountable Officer and notify the Board
                of the appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enbridge had submitted a written notice to the NEB indicating
                that it had appointed an Accountable Officer. In its submission,
                Enbridge confirmed that its Accountable Officer had authority
                over the human and financial resources required to meet the
                Board’s substantive expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided by Enbridge, the Board has not
                identified any non-compliance issues. The Board has therefore
                assessed this sub-element as Compliant.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 - Policy and Commitment Statements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have documented policies and goals to ensure the
                safety and security of the public, workers, and the pipeline and
                ensure protection of property and the environment. Further, as
                these policies and goals are to be used to establish and
                implement the management and programs, the Board requires that
                the policies and goals be explicit from the perspective of
                design, content and communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has developed and communicated
                Health and Safety policies applicable to its activities that had
                been integrated within the company’s activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has established clear management
                system guidance with respect to its process for developing
                policies and goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has developed a policy statement
                that sets out the company’s commitment to these general policies
                and goals and has communicated the its employees
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge has not established an
                explicit policy with respect to internal reporting of hazards,
                potential hazards, incidents and near-misses that includes the
                conditions under which a person who makes a report will be
                granted immunity from disciplinary action that meets the Board’s
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Safety Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.1 - Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment
                and Control
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential
                hazards, assessing the degree of risk associated with the
                hazards, and implementing control measures to minimize or
                eliminate risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge has developed a governance
                management system process for identifying, evaluating and
                managing its hazards and risks; however, the Board also found
                that this governance level management system process did not
                meet the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed and implemented many
                practices for identifying, evaluating and managing its
                occupational health and safety hazards and risks at the program
                level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that at a program level Enbridge had listed the
                majority and most significant of its health and safety hazards;
                however, the process for developing list of hazards and
                potential hazards within risk registers, as described in the
                governance management system processes, did not meet the OPR
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that the program level processes, as
                designed and applied, do not allow for the application of the
                required hierarchy of controls.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had established and was
                maintaining a data management system for monitoring and
                analyzing the trends in its hazards, incidents, and near-misses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Safety Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 - Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for identifying and monitoring compliance with all legal
                requirements applicable to the company. Also, the company must
                maintain a list of the legal requirements that apply to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed a number of
                governance and program level processes and practices for
                identifying and monitoring its legal requirements that had
                accounted for the majority of its legal requirements within its
                health and safety program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge’s governance management
                system processes did not meet the OPR requirements with respect
                to process design and implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had not established and maintained
                a legal list as required by the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Safety Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <p>
                This sub-element of the audit requirements states that the
                company must have an established, implemented and effective
                process for developing and setting goals, objectives and
                specific targets for the risks and hazards associated with the
                company’s facilities and activities. The company must also have
                established policies and goals for the prevention of ruptures,
                liquid and gas releases, fatalities and injuries as required by
                OPR, section&nbsp;6.3(1)(<em>b</em>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Safety Management program against the requirements, the
                Board did not find any non-compliance issues. The Board has
                determined that Enbridge is Compliant with this sub-element.

                enables it to meet the requirements of its management system.
                The company must also complete an annual documented evaluation
                to demonstrate that there is adequate human resourcing to meet

                action is included in many of the sub-elements within the
                Board’s audit protocol and the OPR. The Board therefore requires
                the corrective action plan developed to address the deficiencies
                identified for this sub-element to explicitly include all
                sub-element and OPR requirements, where corrective and
                preventive actions are referenced.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Safety Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.4 - Records Management</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element states that a company must establish and
                implement an effective process for generating, retaining, and
                maintaining records that document the implementation of the
                management system and its protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge had implemented a consistent
                records management practice for application across its
                organization that resulted in appropriate records management
                practice being implemented at the program and corporate levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Enbridge had developed a draft
                governance Records Management Process as part of it integrated
                management system. The Board also found that, due to the draft
                nature of the process, Enbridge did not demonstrate that it has
                established and implemented a management system process that
                meets the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s Management System
                and Safety Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;5.0 - Management Review</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;5.1 - Management Review</h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element states that a company must establish and
                implement an effective process for conducting an annual
                management review of the management system and each protection
                program and for ensuring continual improvement in meeting the
                company’s obligations. This sub-element also requires a company
                to complete an annual report for the previous calendar year,
                signed by the accountable officer, describing the performance of
                the company’s management system in meeting its obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found that Enbridge had developed processes for and
                undertaken activities relating to its Management Review
                responsibilities. The Board also found that Enbridge’s
                management review did not meet all of the requirements outlined
                in the OPR as a result of the processes and practices utilized.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the Board found that some of the Non-Compliant
                findings made in this audit fall within the responsibility and
                accountability of Enbridge’s senior management. These relate to
                direction, management and oversight and, as such, have
                contributed to the Non-compliant finding for this element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the Board’s evaluation of Enbridge’s management system
                and Safety Management program against the requirements, the
                Board has determined that Enbridge is Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element. Enbridge will have to develop corrective actions to
                address the described deficiencies.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive
                commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and
                environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s
                regulation must establish and implement effective management
                systems and Safety Management programs in their day-to-day
                operations. This includes the tools, technologies and actions
                needed to ensure workers are safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this audit Enbridge was required to demonstrate the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its management system and Safety
                Management program to the Board. The Board reviewed
                documentation and records provided by Enbridge, conducted
                inspections and interviewed Enbridge staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on its review, the Board found that Enbridge was in a
                transitory period in terms of establishing and implementing its
                management system. Additionally, the Board found that some of
                Enbridge’s management system processes were not designed or
                established and implemented in a manner that allowed its
                management system to meet the requirements of OPR
                section&nbsp;6.1. Consequently, the Board has found that
                Enbridge’s management system is Non-Compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has found that Enbridge’s Safety Management program
                also reflected the transitory nature of Enbridge’s management
                system and process issues as noted. The Board found, however,
                and most importantly, that, regardless of the design and
                implementation status of its management system,  Enbridge’s
                Safety Management program and the processes and practices being
                used, identified and controlled the majority and most
                significant of the company’s hazards and risks. Enbridge’s
                Safety Management System is closely aligned with the OPR
                requirements at the program level.
              </p>
              <p>
                In analyzing Enbridge’s Non-Compliant findings the Board has
                found that most of them fall into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to management system process
                  development;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-compliances relating to Enbridge’s interpretation of OPR
                  requirements; and
                </li>
                <li>Non-compliances relating to technical content</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the majority of all of the Non-Compliant
                findings made by the Board relate to management system process
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that while no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address these non-compliant findings, as
                per the Board’s standard audit practice, Enbridge must develop
                and submit a corrective action plan describing its proposed
                methods to resolve the non-compliances identified and the
                timeline in which corrective actions will be completed. Enbridge
                will be required to submit its corrective action plan for
                approval within 30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report being
                issued by the Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of Enbridge’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of Enbridge’s Safety Management
                program and management system as a whole through targeted
                compliance verification activities as a part of its ongoing
                regulatory mandate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make its final Audit Report and Enbridge’s
                approved corrective action plan public on the Board’s website.

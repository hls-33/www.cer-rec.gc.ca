                  >Final Audit Report for <br />
                  Pembina Pipeline Corporation (Pembina)</strong

              </p>
              <p>
                The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) has completed its
                Final Audit Report of Pembina. The intent of the audit focused
                on Pembina’s NEB regulated assets that Pembina owns and operates
                under Pembina Energy Services Inc. and Pouce Coupé Pipe Line
                Ltd. Pembina Prairie Facilities Ltd. was not included in the
                scope of this audit. The audit focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.2
                <strong
                  >Investigation and Reporting Incidents and Near Misses</strong
                >
                of the NEB Management System and Protection Program Audit
                Protocol.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Draft Audit Report documenting the Board’s evaluation of
                Pembina was provided to Pembina on 1 February 2017 for review
                and comment. Pembina provided some comments and feedback which
                was reviewed and considered in the development of the Final
                Audit Report. The Board has made several changes to the Draft
                Audit Report and its Appendices.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of
                whether Pembina was compliant with the regulatory requirements
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The National Energy Board Act;</li>
                <li>The National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations;</li>
                <li>
                  The Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II, and the Canada
                  Occupational Health and Safety Regulations;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Pembina was required to demonstrate the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the methods selected and employed within its
                management system and programs to meet the regulatory
                requirements listed above.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has enclosed its Final Audit Report and associated
                Appendices with this letter. The Board will make the Final Audit
                Report public and it will be posted on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the issuance of the Final Audit Report by
                the Board, Pembina is required to file a Corrective Action Plan
                (CAP), which describes the methods and timing for addressing the
                Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for
                approval.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the CAP public and will continue to monitor
                and assess all of Pembina’s corrective actions with respect to
                this audit until they are fully implemented. The Board will also
                continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of
                Pembina’s management system and programs through targeted
                compliance verification activities as a part of its on-going
                regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and environmental protection.
                Pipeline companies under the Board’s jurisdiction are required
                to incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s audit of Pembina Energy
                Services Inc. and Pouce Coupé Pipe Line Ltd. (Pembina). The
                audit was focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.2
                <strong
                  >Investigation and Reporting Incidents and Near-misses</strong
                >
                of the National Energy Board Management System and Protection
                Program Audit Protocol published in July 2013. The audit also
                evaluated some of the other management system elements which
                were relevant to the scope of this audit. The audit was
                conducted using the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline
                Regulations (OPR) as amended on 19&nbsp;June 2016 and the
                relevant sections of CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 as well as the
                requirements of the Canada Labour Code (CLC), Part&nbsp;II, and
                the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (COHSR).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit using the audit protocols detailed
                in Appendices&nbsp;I and II.
                <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> covers these five components
                of sub-element&nbsp;4.2: Reporting of Incidents and Near-Misses;
                Investigation; Developing and Implementing Corrective and
                Preventive Actions; Communication of Findings, Follow Up and
                Shared Learnings; and Analysis and Trending of Data Related to
                Incidents and Near-Misses.
                <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> covers other management
                system elements that were relevant to the scope of this audit.
                These two Appendices comprise the body of the audit assessment
                of Pembina.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the time of the Board’s audit of Pembina’s regulated
                facilities, Pembina was in transition from an old incident
                investigation and reporting system to a completely new and
                different system. Many of the process documents and procedures
                were found to be in transition from the former system to the new
                system and as result many of the OPR required processes were
                found to be non-compliant. However, during this transition
                period, the Board found that Pembina was using ongoing
                established activities still based on their old system for the
                reporting of incidents and near-misses, conducting
                investigations, developing corrective and preventive actions and
                learning from incidents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board found all of <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> to be
                non-compliant; and 4&nbsp;findings of non-compliance were
                identified in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>. These
                non-compliances are described below.

                  <strong>Finding&nbsp;10:</strong> Pembina does not have an
                  effective process for the retaining and maintaining of records
                  related to incident investigations. This is non-compliant with
                  OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)&nbsp;(p).<br />

              </ol>
              <p>
                Although Pembina has been found non-compliant in the above noted
                instances, the Board is satisfied that Pembina has adequate
                activities in place while they update their existing standards,
                procedures and processes to reflect their newly established
                system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued,
                Pembina must develop and submit a Corrective Action Plan for
                Board approval. The Corrective Action Plan must detail how
                Pembina intends to resolve the non-compliances identified by
                this audit. The Board will verify that the corrective actions
                are completed in a timely manner and applied consistently across
                the NEB-regulated portion of Pembina’s system. However, the
                Pembina Prairie Facilities system, which is NEB-regulated and is
                operated under contract by NOVA Chemicals Corporation, was not
                included in the scope of this audit. The Board will also
                continue to monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness
                of Pembina’s management system and programs through targeted
                compliance verification activities as part of its ongoing
                regulatory mandate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make its Final Audit Report and Pembina’s
                approved Corrective Action Plan public on the Board’s website.

                (The Board has applied the following definitions and
                explanations in measuring the various requirements included in
                this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or
                guidance and practices established by the Board, where
                available.)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes comply with the scope, documentation requirements and,
                where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the
                NEB&nbsp;Act, its associated regulations and referenced
                standards. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is
                demonstrated through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> The company has demonstrated that it
                has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses
                the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains
                the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent
                basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented,
                meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.

                of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained
                on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others
                working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the
                process or other requirement. Records and interviews have
                provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as
                prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially
                utilized).

              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(o). With records, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the records management requirements in
                OPR, section&nbsp;6.5 (1)(p).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR
                sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach
                designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote
                continual improvement. The system includes the organizational
                structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and
                procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations
                related to safety, security and environmental protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to
                its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set
                out in OPR sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in
                evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers
                more than the specific requirements of section&nbsp;6.1. It
                considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and
                implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its
                management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its
                organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6.4; and
                considers the establishment, implementation, development and/or
                maintenance of the processes, inventory and list described in
                section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1(c)
                and&nbsp;(d), the company’s management system and processes must
                apply and be applied to the programs described in
                section&nbsp;55.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> The company has not demonstrated
                that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and
                procedures that meet the legal requirements. A Corrective Action
                Plan must be developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Practice:</strong> A repeated or customary action that
                is well understood by the persons authorized to carry it out.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order thereby allowing
                individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe
                manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities
                and authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that
                take place in an established order and are directed toward a
                specific result. A process also outlines the roles,
                responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A
                process may contain a set of procedures, if required.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management system processes
                applicable to its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) describes the Board’s required
                management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                developed or maintained as described within each section;
                whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                designed to address the requirements of the process, for example
                a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and
                potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required
                actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for
                staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The
                Board considers this to constitute a common 5 w’s and h approach
                (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that
                the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may
                therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as
                they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate
                any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR section.
                Processes must incorporate or contain linkage to procedures,
                where required to meet the process requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the processes constitute part of the management system, the
                required processes must be developed in a manner that allows
                them to function as part of the system. The required management
                system is described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must
                be designed in a manner that contributes to the company
                following its policies and goals established and required by
                section&nbsp;6.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each process
                must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the
                programs referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be
                compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which
                considers the specific technical requirements associated with
                each program and is applied to and meets the process
                requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that
                single process may not meet all of the programs; in these cases
                it is acceptable to establish governance processes as long as
                they meet the process requirements (as described above) and
                direct the program processes to be established and implemented
                in a consistent manner that allows for the management system to
                function as described in 6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program
                outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in
                other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company
                regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the
                program is achieving the intended results.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB
                regulations.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The program must include details on the activities to be
                completed including what, by whom, when, and how. The program
                must also include the resources required to complete the
                activities.

              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection
                of the environment, the Board has developed regulations
                requiring companies to establish and implement documented
                management systems applicable to specified technical management
                and protection programs. These management systems and programs
                must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the
                NEB Act and its associated regulations, as well as the Canada
                Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II. The Board’s management system
                requirements are described within the OPR, sections&nbsp;6.1
                through&nbsp;6.6.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and samples
                records provided by the company in its demonstration of
                compliance and interviews corporate and regionally-based staff.
                This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness
                and implementation of the management system and programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                issues a Final Audit Report (this document). The Draft Audit
                Report is submitted to the company for its review and to provide
                the company the opportunity to submit its comments to the Board.
                The Board will take the company’s comments into consideration
                before issuing the Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report
                outlines the Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations
                of the company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory
                requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the
                company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to
                address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports are
                published on the Board’s website. The audit results are
                integrated into the NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to
                compliance assurance.

                The NEB expects pipeline companies to operate in a systematic,
                comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board
                expects companies to have effective, fully developed and
                implemented management systems and protection programs that
                provide for continual improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and
                maintain effective management systems and protection programs in
                order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions
                that may adversely affect the safety and security of the
                company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as
                the protection of property and the environment.

                and near-miss reporting and investigation, incident and
                near-miss data analysis and integration, and taking corrective
                and preventive actions. The audit verified that the company has
                developed and implemented the systems, programs and processes to
                meet the applicable legal requirements in order to ensure the
                protection of property and the environment and the safety and
                security of the public and of the company’s employees.

              <p>
                On 22&nbsp;September 2016, the Board informed Pembina of its
                intent to audit Pembina’s NEB-regulated facilities with the
                exclusion of the Pembina Prairie Facilities system. Board staff
                then submitted the audit protocols (Appendices&nbsp;I and II) to
                Pembina, requesting it to answer specific questions relevant to
                the scope of the audit and initial documentation requests.
                <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> is divided in five sections,
                with each section covering a partial component of the Board’s
                expectations for sub-element&nbsp;4.2. Each section lists the
                questions that have been asked to the company in order to
                demonstrate compliance. The NEB conducted its assessment based
                on the responses provided by the company and the evidence
                gathered during the audit. The same approach was used for the
                audit assessment summarized in
                <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Board staff was in contact with Pembina staff on a regular basis
                to arrange and coordinate this audit. Pembina established a
                digital access portal for Board staff to review documentation
                and records.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 14&nbsp;October 2016, Board staff conducted an opening
                meeting with representatives from Pembina in Calgary, Alberta to
                confirm the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process.
                Subsequent to the opening meeting, interviews were held in
                Sherwood Park, AB; Fort St.&nbsp;John, BC; and at Pembina’s head
                office in Calgary between 21&nbsp;November and 1&nbsp;December
                2016. The table below provides more details about the audit
                activities. Throughout the audit, Board audit staff gave Pembina

              <p>
                During this audit, Pembina was required to demonstrate the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its management system, programs
                and its processes as they relate to incident and near-miss
                reporting and investigation, incident and near-miss data
                analysis and integration, and taking corrective and preventive
                actions. The Board reviewed documentation and records provided
                by Pembina and interviewed Pembina’s staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Pembina’s NEB-regulated facilities found
                that Pembina was in transition from one incident, investigation,
                and data analysis system to a new, completely different system.
                As a result a significant number of processes and procedures
                were in the process of being updated to reflect the operation of
                the new system. During the transition, Pembina was completing
                the majority of these management system elements by activity and
                not by effectively implemented and established processes, which
                is required by the OPR, for reporting incidents and near-misses,
                conducting investigations, developing corrective and preventive
                actions and learning from incidents. For the majority of the
                required processes, Pembina was still using the processes and
                related documentation from their recently retired Lotus Notes
                based system as revisions were being put in place to accommodate
                their new system. Staff was aware of the processes and
                procedures that they were supposed to be using and demonstrated
                this during interviews and through a review of records.
              </p>
              <p>
                The OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(3) requires that companies document the
                processes and procedures required by the OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1).
                Pembina was found non-compliant for all areas in
                <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> as they do not have fully
                documented process for investigations, taking corrective and
                preventive actions, trending and analysis and communicating
                lessons learned. Pembina was found to be non-compliant with
                several sub-elements in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>,
                generally for areas that are not related to their incident
                investigation, reporting, corrective and preventative actions,
                and analysis. Findings listed below are grouped according to

                  reflective of its current system for reporting of incidents
                  and near-misses, and it did not have definitions for an
                  incident that was reflective of all programs.

              <p>
                The audit verified that Pembina does not have definitions of
                incidents that are applicable to all program areas required by
                the OPR. By activity, Pembina is conducting internal reporting
                of incidents and near-misses, however this is not compliant with
                OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(r) and 6.5(2) which requires documented
                processes. The Board found that Pembina had recognized the gap
                and has undertaken steps to address this issue.

              <p>
                The audit verified that Pembina does not have a process in place
                to reflect the current requirements to report applicable
                incidents to the Board. Pembina’s current process does not
                reflect the requirements of the Online Event Reporting System
                (OERS) that has been in place since 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;January
                2015, and as a result they are non-compliant with
                OPR&nbsp;s.52(1). The Board found through interviews that
                Pembina management is aware of the issue and provided draft
                documentation to show they are working on updating this process.

              <p>
                That audit verified that Pembina demonstrated that it has
                conducted investigations of incidents and near-misses. However,
                the documented process used is not reflective of the new system
                that was put in place in 2016 and is non-compliant with
                OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(r). Additionally, a sampling of investigations
                by Board staff indicated the root cause did not always appear to
                line up with the incident investigation. The Board identified
                through interviews that Pembina is aware and had previously
                identified this gap and is working on revising the processes and
                documentation to correct this finding.

                and safety meetings. However, the currently documented process
                is not adequately detailed for the Board to consider it an
                adequate and effective process. This is non-compliant to

                The audit verified that Pembina performs some limited trending
                and analysis of data through their newly implemented SMART
                system. Senior management is provided with various statistics
                and analysis on a monthly and quarterly basis. However, Pembina
                does not currently trend and analyze data for all program areas
                and the Board identified concerns about how some incidents are
                categorized and assessed during the investigation phase. As a
                result the trending and analysis of data may not provide
                accurate information. This is non-compliant with

              </p>
              <p>
                The audit verified that Pembina has in practice an investigation
                process that allows the company to investigate its incidents and
                near-misses, and identify the necessary corrective and
                preventive actions. However, the current practice is not fully
                reflected in a documented process, which is non-compliant with
                the OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(3). Pembina had already identified this gap
                and has initiated steps to address this issue.

                The audit verified that Pembina does capture new hazards and
                potential hazards from incidents and near-misses through an ad
                hoc process. However Pembina has not established an inventory of
                all hazards and identified hazards as required under
                OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(d). As this audit was narrow in its scope, it
                did not review in detail all of the other clauses that make up

                Pembina did provide portions of two recently conducted internal

                covered parts of the health and safety section of the NEB
                Integrity Management Program. However, Pembina does not have all
                required programs in place, and the audit protocols for the
                Damage Prevention Program are dated 16&nbsp;December 2016, which
                does not meet the test of being effectively implemented as
                described in section 1 above. The Board also identified concerns
                with Pembina’s quality assurance program related to
                categorization of incidents and the determination of potential
                severity of incidents. This is in non-compliance to
                OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(w). As this audit was narrow in its scope, it

                near-miss investigations, Pembina did not demonstrate that they
                had a process to ensure all applicable records were traceable
                and trackable. This is in non-compliance to

                Although Pembina has been found non-compliant in the above noted

                activities in place while they update their existing standards,
                procedures and processes to reflect their newly established
                system.

              <p>
                As per the Board’s standard audit practice, Pembina must develop
                and submit a Corrective Action Plan describing its proposed
                methods to resolve the non-compliances identified and the
                timeline in which corrective actions will be completed. Pembina
                will be required to submit to the Board for approval its
                Corrective Action Plan within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued by the Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of Pembina
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system-wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of Pembina’s management system
                and programs through targeted compliance verification activities
                as a part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Incident: An unplanned, undesired event that hinders
                    completion of a task and may cause injury, illness, or
                    property damage;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Near-miss: An incident where there was no damage or personal
                    injury sustained, but given a slight shift in position or
                    time, damage and/or injury could have easily occurred; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Hazard ID: A hazard is the potential associated with a
                    condition or activity that, if left uncontrolled, can result
                    in an incident.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In addition to the above definitions, and specific to pipeline
                  incidents, Pembina would further classify using CSA&nbsp;Z662
                  Annex&nbsp;H into a damage incident or a failure incident. A
                  damage incident includes an event that damages the pipe or
                  component without a release, and a failure incident as an
                  unplanned release of fluid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Interviews with Pembina personnel indicated the definition of
                  incident as it applies to several programs, such as Damage
                  Prevention and Environment, and the overall management system
                  is currently being updated. It is the Board’s understanding
                  that revisions will include further clarity and criteria for
                  definition of an incident and near-miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is the Board’s understanding that in May 2016, Pembina
                  moved from a Lotus Notes based software system for reporting
                  incidents and near-misses to a new software system called
                  <strong>Safety Management and Recognition Tool (SMART)</strong
                  >. This system is now responsible for the workflow and
                  processes from initial reporting through investigation to the
                  completion of action items associated with the incident. The
                  SMART system was designed to be used for the reporting of
                  incidents, near-misses, hazard identification, and positive
                  safety recognitions which are used by staff to give positive
                  recognition to other staff members in relation to being safe
                  at work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through the SMART system Pembina categorizes and breaks down
                  Incidents and Near-misses into the following broad categories:
                  environment (spills and releases), property damage, illness
                  injury, and fatality (safety), security, public concern
                  noncompliance, quality measurement production loss, and
                  vehicle incident. Additional categories of hazard
                  identification and refusal of unsafe work also exist in the
                  SMART system for additional trending and analysis options for
                  Pembina.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pembina provided a draft environmental standard that further
                  defines and expands upon environmental incident types, along
                  with a clarification on roles and responsibilities, regulatory
                  thresholds, and reporting requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through document review and interviews, the Board found that
                  <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.01</strong> incident reporting and
                  investigation procedure has not been revised to reflect the
                  changes from the previous Lotus Notes system to the new SMART
                  incident investigation data system. Examples include incident
                  classification, workflow with review and approval by an SSER
                  Analyst, and entering more than one incident type for a single
                  incident.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board has found that Pembina has a documented standard
                  <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong> for performing incident
                  investigations, however, the standard has the following key
                  deficiencies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Standard only applies to Safety, Environment and Emergency
                    and does not adequately describe the applicability of
                    Integrity, Damage Prevention and the management system
                    including program specific definitions of incidents. For
                    example the Environment program definition is limited to
                    spills and releases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Appendix 2 Incident Notification Guideline</strong>
                    is not outlined. <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong> does not
                    adequately address the Integrity Management Program, Damage
                    Prevention and Crossings programs related to incident
                    investigation and near-misses in its current form. Through
                    interviews and information requests (IRs) to Pembina, the
                    Board was made aware that these deficiencies have been
                    recognized in the Damage Prevention and Crossings programs
                    and updates to <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong> that are
                    currently underway.

                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina has demonstrated that some parts of a process for
                  reporting of hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                  near-misses have been established and implemented in
                  <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong>. Some processes and some
                  roles and responsibilities have been outlined.

                  and considering the scope of this audit, the Board has
                  identified a non-compliance with OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(r) and

                  also describes the information to be provided in the
                  preliminary incident report, but does not provide a process
                  for reporting to the NEB. During interviews Pembina did
                  indicate all reporting to the NEB would go through their

                <p>
                  Pembina has a Regulatory Reporting Process Manual, but there
                  is no mention of the process of reporting incidents to the

                  Through an all company letter, the Board informed all
                  NEB-regulated companies that as of January&nbsp;1<sup>st</sup>
                  2015, regulated entities were to use the new online event
                  reporting system (OERS) to inform the Board of all reportable
                  incidents. However Pembina’s document
                  <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong> does not outline the OERS
                  requirements. Through an IR, Pembina provided a portion of the
                  draft revised <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong>. In this
                  document they now reference the OERS for NEB-reportable
                  incidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the documentation reviewed and in discussion during
                  interviews, Pembina does not include all of the Board’s
                  reporting guidelines in their current definition of a
                  Board-reportable incident. Pembina did not include reporting a
                  significant adverse effect on the environment, an unintended
                  or uncontrolled release of gas, and operating a pipeline
                  beyond its design limits or any operating limit imposed by the
                  Board. According to section&nbsp;3.1 within the OERS guidance
                  document the following scenarios apply:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the death of or serious injury to a person;</li>

                  The Board’s review of Pembina’s incident investigations
                  indicated an incident on the NEB portion of the Pembina system
                  which should have been reported to the NEB. A review of the
                  NEB incident database did not indicate such a report had been

                  chart for investigators to follow. The chart is to provide
                  basic information to an investigator when completing their
                  work. However after review of the process, the Board found it
                  to be lacking detail and instruction on how to fully complete
                  an investigation including steps such as looking at how the
                  hazards identified in original existing hazard analysis failed
                  to prevent the incident or near-miss. Additional steps on
                  verifying the proper selection of incident type, record
                  keeping, and assurance that corrective actions were
                  implemented are lacking in detail or missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through interviews, the Board identified that it is possible
                  for Pembina to enter a sub-incident as part of a larger more
                  complex incident. However, near-misses and hazard IDs are
                  stand alone and cannot be automatically linked as part of an
                  incident in SMART. Additionally this was not written into the
                  existing process document.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on the severity and type of incident, an
                  investigation team may be created and become part of the
                  investigation. The investigation team would generally include
                  the lead investigator, subject matter experts as required, and
                  the person who was involved in the incident. During
                  interviews, Pembina indicated that the lead investigator has
                  to have completed the 5&nbsp;Why training and can either be
                  recommended by someone in a supervisory capacity or they can
                  be someone who is recommended by the person who entered the
                  incident into the SMART.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During a review of incident and near-miss data, the Board
                  identified several incidents where the incident type, incident
                  description, severity and likelihood did not fully align. In
                  more than one incident the incident type was selected for
                  environment (spill/ release) but the incident description
                  would have suggested that the incident was safety
                  (illness/injury/fatality) or vehicle incident related. This
                  also applied to severity rating where either a health and
                  safety descriptor was applied to an environment incident.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, the Board frequently identified incidents where
                  the likelihood was entered as rare (remote occurrence in
                  industry) or unlikely (remote occurrence in company/
                  occasional occurrence in industry) but there were repeat
                  incidents occurring in less than a year that were almost
                  identical in nature. With a low severity descriptor and a rare
                  or unlikely likelihood the SMART system would generate a low
                  potential severity rating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through interviews and document review the auditors found that
                  Safety Advisors do have the ability to enter the SMART system
                  and update or change entries where required, however in none
                  of the incidents looked at by the Board had this occurred.
                  Approvers of the incident report also have the ability to
                  reject the report, and have the lead investigator make changes
                  where there has been identified concerns. The Board did not
                  observe a quality assurance check in place to ensure the
                  quality of the investigation details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board reviewed information for numerous incidents in the
                  SMART database and specifically reviewed the root causes for
                  several incidents. The Board found it difficult to determine
                  how the root cause was linked to the actual incident without
                  additional description added to the incident to explain the
                  linkage. Pembina did not demonstrate any additional
                  information to clarify the discussed root causes. Discussion
                  with several interviewees indicated they had concerns
                  regarding the quality with some of the investigations.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina has demonstrated that some parts of a process for
                  incident and near-miss investigation are in place. Some roles
                  and responsibilities have been outlined for use.

                <p>
                  The audit verified that Pembina does not have an established,

                  The Board has found that
                  <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.01.1</strong> standard provides the steps
                  for performing an incident investigation; however, it does not
                  adequately provide a process to guide Pembina employees on how
                  to create corrective and preventative actions.

                <p>
                  Pembina’s SMART system contains fields where proposed
                  corrective and preventative actions for incidents and
                  near-misses can be entered, along with assigning a person
                  responsible, target deadline, actual completion date, status,
                  and action validated. Through interviews, Pembina indicated
                  that it is not mandatory to have preventative or corrective
                  actions entered in the system prior to closing an incident in
                  SMART.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>SMS document&nbsp;10.1.01</strong> was originally
                  developed for the old Lotus Notes system, but it has not yet
                  been revised to reflect the procedural steps as required in
                  the new SMART system for corrective and preventative actions.
                  The Board has found the steps in SMART system are not
                  adequately described in the <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.01.</strong>1
                  standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Proposed corrective and preventative actions are entered into
                  SMART and tracked through to sign-off. The Board found there
                  is no documented process that outlines the activities that a
                  Lead Investigator is to perform to close-out the action items
                  including verification of evidence (assurance the corrective
                  actions were implemented according to plans).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through a review of incidents and near-misses over the past
                  year, the Board identified incidents where both corrective and
                  preventative actions had been entered for the same incident.
                  However, this was not consistent, as other incidents had these
                  fields blank and appeared to have the same level of potential
                  severity. Additionally, even though these fields were not
                  completed, they were approved by the Lead Investigator and the
                  Safety Advisor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through the Board’s sampling of the incident investigations,
                  it was not always clear that management system causation was
                  considered to ensure the company’s management system was
                  revised to prevent the incident from re-occurring. Corrective
                  actions were typically limited in their depth and scope and in
                  many instances it was difficult to observe how the corrective
                  actions would prevent a similar incident from re-occurring.
                  Interviews with Pembina personnel confirmed the concern about
                  the quality of the investigations and the comprehensiveness of
                  incident investigations corrective actions.

                    Incidents</strong
                  >, provides information on learnings that can be used in the
                  prevention of incidents. However, the Board has found there is
                  no process or direction given on what incidents are selected,
                  or how broadly the information needs to be communicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pembina document <strong>1.1.03 </strong>is not linked to the
                  existing version of <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong>, which
                  as described previously does contain a minimal amount of
                  information on learnings from incidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pembina’s <strong>Incident Review Panel (IRP</strong>), as
                  described above, review selected incidents and near-misses. A
                  review of the documentation provided by Pembina indicated that
                  the IRP charter was established in 2010.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Learnings from incidents, including some discussed at the IRP,
                  are formally communicated throughout the company, beyond just
                  the business unit where the incident took place, in the form
                  of Safety Bulletins; and are also posted on the Company’s
                  internal website. Interviews indicated that not all incidents
                  have an associated Safety Bulletin and selected incident
                  learnings are chosen for communication. Examples of Safety
                  Bulletins were provided to the Board for review.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pembina has monthly safety meetings at each of their locations
                  in which incidents are reviewed by staff, and all staff are
                  required to sign off on these learnings to demonstrate that
                  they have reviewed them. Evidence of this was provided to the
                  Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During interviews, Pembina indicated all regulatory reporting
                  would go through their Regulatory Affairs group and there was
                  some documentation made available that supported this
                  statement, even though it was not detailed in the incident
                  reporting process. The current version of
                  <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong> did not have all of the
                  steps, role descriptions, and other requirements for
                  communicating to the NEB as related to reportable incidents. A
                  portion of the revised draft document
                  <strong>SMS&nbsp;10.1.01</strong> was shared with the auditors
                  and it did appear to be correcting some of these deficiencies.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina has demonstrated that some parts of a process for
                  communication of findings, follow-up and shared learnings are
                  in place. Some roles and responsibilities have been outlined
                  for use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Pembina does not have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for communication of
                  findings, follow-up and shared learnings. Based on the review
                  conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the Board
                  has identified a non-compliance with OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(m) in
                  relation to Question&nbsp;4.0 &ndash; Communication of
                  Findings, Follow-up and Shared Learnings.

                <h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board has found that Pembina, through the SMART system,
                  was able to demonstrate that data is collected and retained on
                  incidents and near-misses, and that users can sort and search
                  various types of data that has been entered into the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During interviews, the Board was informed that one of the
                  mandatory fields for entering data into the SMART system for
                  all incidents is an investigation classification technique for
                  incident causation codes. Interviews confirmed that all
                  incidents entered into the SMART system have to be defined
                  with causation code(s) and in many instances interviewees
                  indicated the causation codes sometimes do not line up well
                  with the actual incident. While management does receive the
                  top&nbsp;5 causation codes as part of their monthly report,
                  the Board is concerned the causation codes may not always be
                  informing management of what the true issue or concern is
                  behind the codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of Pembina data trending and data analysis, Pembina
                  management is provided with metrics showing the top 5
                  causation codes for incidents on a monthly basis. Key metrics
                  are scored against targets and circulated internally through a
                  monthly Score Card completed for each business unit.
                  Additional data, such as trending for business units, is
                  included in a monthly Highlights Report which is provided to
                  management and the Board of Directors. Additionally Pembina
                  indicated the HSE Metrics Scorecard is used to evaluate each
                  business unit against established targets, which impacts all
                  employees’ annual incentives. Additional trending and analysis
                  is done for vehicle incidents, spill/ release data, and
                  injuries which compare numbers with the previous year’s data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As discussed in section&nbsp;1.0 Reporting of Incidents and
                  Near-misses, Pembina does not have incident categories that
                  cover all program areas and has limited reporting for
                  environment which at the moment only includes spills /
                  releases. The Board has found that a majority of the data
                  available for trending and analysis is related to safety and
                  vehicle incidents. As a result of this, the amount of data
                  that is available for trending and analysis is limited in
                  depth and breadth for an organization the size and scope of
                  Pembina NEB-regulated operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As discussed in the above Section&nbsp;2.0 Investigation, and
                  through sampling of investigations, the Board had identified
                  numerous incidents that had been mis-categorized and / or
                  assigned only one incident type when inputted into the SMART
                  system. As an example, Environment (spill/ release) incidents
                  were categorized and no corresponding safety incident was
                  inputted into the SMART system. As a result of incidents being
                  mis-categorized or input as a single incident type, there is a
                  risk that the data being trended and analyzed is skewed or
                  misaligned, and it could result in missing critical trends in
                  the data. Additionally the Board identified that some
                  incidents had potential severity scores that were not aligned
                  with the likelihood and the severity descriptors for the
                  incident. As a result of this, the Board is concerned the
                  trending and analysis of incident data can also be skewed or
                  misaligned with what the true potential severity of the
                  incidents could be, and critical trends are not being
                  identified. With inaccurate data, there is a risk that the
                  hazards and risks associated with the company’s activities are
                  not being accurately assessed and therefore, tracked and
                  trended.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina has demonstrated they have an electronic database for
                  the collection of data and that it can do some analysis and
                  trending of information. The information is being shared
                  within the company through to senior management, and is being
                  used for decision making purposes. Some roles and
                  responsibilities have been outlined for use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Pembina does not have established,

                  The Board has found Pembina’s OMS contains management
                  commitment, planning and implementation components, and
                  methods for checking and corrective actions. Pembina provided
                  six&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;different policies (alcohol &amp; drug
                  policy, health, safety &amp; environment policy, information
                  technology acceptable use policy, respectful workplace policy,
                  security management policy, and whistleblower policy) as part
                  of their evidence to demonstrate their activities are
                  conducted in a manner that ensures the safety and security of
                  the public, workers, and the protection of the environment.
                  Three (3) key policies included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>HSE Policy</strong> &ndash; identifying and managing
                    risk to an acceptable level;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Security Management Policy</strong> &ndash;
                    identifying security risks and establishing programs, plans
                    etc. to reduce risk to an acceptable level; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Whistleblower Policy</strong> &ndash; a process for
                    reporting of serious issues and confidential follow-up.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The <strong>Whistleblower Policy</strong>, dated November
                  2015, advises employees in the
                  <strong>Prevention of Retaliation</strong> section that they
                  “will be protected from retaliation, harassment, discharge,
                  demotion, suspension or other types of discrimination, or
                  threats thereof, including compensation or terms and
                  conditions of employment, that are directly related to the
                  disclosure of such reports...” The policy states the
                  conditions under which a person who makes a report will be
                  granted immunity from disciplinary action and includes several
                  options on how employees can file a complaint including
                  internal options and an external hotline.

                  >
                  as their standard for hazard identification and control. The
                  document provides Pembina employees with information on hazard
                  identification and classification, hazard categories, sources
                  of hazards, assessment and control principles, and hierarchy
                  of controls. The Board was provided with examples of hazards
                  identified and reported in their database system for critical
                  and non-routine tasks and demonstrated the system is being
                  used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pembina utilizes a database system, called the SMART system,
                  to collect and track hazard identifications and corrective
                  actions. Pembina indicated that the SMART system tracks newly
                  identified hazards, but does not maintain a consolidated list
                  of hazards which incorporates newly identified hazard as
                  required by OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(d) that addresses the
                  management system and all protection programs. Pembina could
                  not demonstrate they have identified all potential hazards
                  associated with their activities and processes. As such, there
                  is no integration of newly identified hazards or review of
                  existing hazards on the inventory as part of the incident
                  investigation.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina demonstrated that potential hazards, hazards and
                  controls are considered as part of routine and non-routine
                  task analysis and a standard is available for staff to use
                  when conducting hazard analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Pembina does not have adequate
                  processes and procedures to identify hazards through incident
                  and near-miss reporting. Currently newly identified hazards
                  are not incorporated into an existing hazard and risk
                  registry. Based on the review conducted and considering the
                  scope of this audit, the Board identified a non-compliance
                  with OPR&nbsp;6.5(1)(d) in relation to Question&nbsp;2.1
                  &ndash; Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control.

                  The audit verified that Pembina has goals, objectives, targets
                  and performance measures for the prevention of ruptures,
                  liquid and gas releases, fatalities and injuries. Pembina
                  tracks the relevant performance metrics and identifies where
                  actions are required to improve performance. Based on the
                  review conducted and considering the scope of this audit, the
                  Board did not identify any issues of non-compliance in
                  relation to Question&nbsp;2.3 &ndash; Goals, Objectives and
                  Targets.

                  existing and future facilities, controlled documents and key

                  impact Pembina’s operations and that are not replacements in
                  kind; administration of controlled documents; and

                <p>
                  Based on their assigned job role, Pembina employees received
                  5-Why training and/or internal SMART system introduction
                  training. Board staff reviewed a portion of both the training
                  courses and found the training contained information on the
                  basics steps to an investigation and using the database
                  system. The Board found that competency evaluations are built
                  into the training and the student must complete these as part
                  of the training package.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board found that some employees within Safety Advisory
                  roles received additional incident investigation training in
                  external providers’ advanced root cause analysis techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board requested the training records for all employees
                  that were interviewed as part of this audit. All records
                  sampled were up to date and where the employee’s assigned job
                  required investigation training, the records indicated that it
                  had been completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board did identify some non-compliances of the
                  OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(r) as noted in
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report that are
                  associated with Pembina’s internal standards and processes for
                  incident investigation and reporting. However, the Board did
                  not find any non-compliances with the training and competency
                  as required for this sub-element. It is the expectation of the
                  Board that where changes and modifications are made to
                  standards and processes in sub-element 4.2, and new or revised
                  training is identified as the best method to communicate these
                  changes that Pembina will promptly provide the training to all
                  employees who require it for their job functions.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina demonstrated that it has provided various types of
                  training on the current version of their new SMART system to a
                  broad base of its employees over a short time span. While the
                  Board identified non-compliances with Pembina’s incident
                  investigation and reporting, Pembina did demonstrate that they
                  take training their staff seriously and that they took steps
                  to provide what they believed to be a comprehensive training
                  package. Based on the review conducted and considering the
                  scope of this audit, the Board did not identify compliance
                  issues in relation to Question&nbsp;3.4 &ndash; Training,
                  Competence and Evaluation.

                  The external provider of one of the audits found Pembina to be
                  compliant in the area of Incident Reporting and Investigation
                  during their audit. Through an Information Request the Board
                  requested the completed protocols for the external audit,
                  which was to include who was interviewed and what was sampled
                  for this audit. Pembina responded to the Board that the audit
                  was to be done to the most stringent requirements of the three
                  regulators (NEB, Alberta Energy Regulator, and BC Oil and Gas
                  Commission) and the audit protocol was based on the
                  17&nbsp;elements set out in the
                  <strong
                    >NEB Management System and Protection Program
                    Protocol</strong
                  >. Also provided was a list of documentation reviewed by the
                  external auditor and the list of positions who were
                  interviewed. There is no indication of sampling of past
                  incidents as part of the external audit activities contained
                  in the provided information.

                  As outlined in the Introduction Section of the
                  <strong>Health and Safety NEB Audit 2016 DRAFT</strong> audit
                  report, the audit was completed using a partial list from the
                  NEB pipeline integrity audit protocol sub elements with a
                  focus on the health and safety sections. The sub-elements
                  reviewed included the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Policy and Commitment Statements;</li>
                  <li>Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Controls;</li>
                  <li>Goals, Objectives and Targets, Training;</li>
                  <li>Training, Competency and Evaluation;</li>
                  <li>
                    Investigating and Reporting Incidents and Near Misses; and
                  </li>
                  <li>Internal Audits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  One finding was identified in the draft report under the
                  section of
                  <strong
                    >Investigating and Reporting Incidents and
                    Near-Misses</strong
                  >. However as the report was in draft at the time of the
                  Board’s audit, no further discussion will be provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While reviewing some of the incident investigations conducted
                  by Pembina staff, the Board identified a concern with the
                  quality assurance program currently in place for this sub
                  element. The following are some of the deficiencies identified
                  through a sampling by Board staff:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Some incidents were categorized as a safety or a vehicle
                    incident but the investigation had it categorized as an
                    environment incident and no other incident report was made;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some incidents were given a likelihood of occurrence as
                    remote in the industry, or remote in the company and
                    occasional in the industry, but the Board observed multiple
                    occurrences of similar incidents in the incident data
                    reviewed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Through the SMART system, there are multiple levels of
                    review and approval and the ability to reject the
                    investigation and to have it updated or re-done. The Board
                    did not see this quality assurance activity being applied to
                    correct inaccurate data entries. As this data is then used
                    for trending and analysis, using faulty data can lead to
                    poor trending and analysis.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina was not able to demonstrate that they had conducted
                  internal audits on all programs as required under
                  OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(w). The Board recognizes that a newly
                  developed standard for audits is now in place at Pembina for
                  the Damage Prevention Program, but it is the Board’s opinion
                  that the standard is too new to be considered fully
                  implemented at the time of this audit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board has additional concerns with the quality assurance
                  requirements of the management system with respect to incident
                  investigations and near misses. As discussed in
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report, during
                  sampling of Pembina incident investigations, potential errors
                  in the selection of incident categories, severity and
                  likelihood could lead to inaccurate determinations of
                  potential severity and poor trending and analysis of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Pembina does not have a fully
                  implemented internal audit and quality assurance program for
                  their management system. Based on the review conducted and
                  considering the scope of this audit, the Board identified a
                  non-compliance with OPR&nbsp;s.6.5(1)(w) in relation to
                  Question&nbsp;4.3 &ndash; Internal Audit.

                  Pembina uses various methods and processes for managing
                  operational, management system, and program related records.
                  Examples were provided through their integrity program records
                  which are connected to the OPR and CSA&nbsp;Z662 requirements
                  for storage and retention. Another example provided was for
                  their employee training program for learning and competency
                  tracking associated with individual job roles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board has found that Pembina has not demonstrated an
                  established and implemented process for records management
                  related to incident investigations. Additionally, Lead
                  Investigators are not aware of what relevant and required
                  documents associated with an investigation are required to be
                  retained and uploaded to the SMART system to ensure they are
                  traceable and trackable.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pembina has demonstrated they have incident investigation
                  database to track and store information incident investigation
                  records. Pembina was not able to demonstrate that they had an
                  established and implemented process for records management
                  related to incident investigation to ensure required records
                  and associated material are traceable and trackable.

                <p>
                  The audit verified that Pembina does not have a fully

                  As part of conducting a management review, Pembina completes
                  an <strong>OPR Gap Analysis</strong> annually and the Pembina
                  2015 version of the analysis was provided for review by the
                  Board. The Gap Analysis breaks down the OPR management system
                  and program requirements into individual clauses as required.
                  Pembina then provides an analysis of where they perceive their
                  compliance is with each requirement. For each requirement they
                  link it to a specific Pembina program or document they feel
                  substantiates their compliance, or where compliance has not
                  been achieved they provide a description of the steps being
                  taken to reach compliance. The Gap Analysis includes all

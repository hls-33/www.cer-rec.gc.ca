              </p>
              <p>
                On 18&nbsp;August 2016, the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) informed TMPU of its intent to audit Trans Mountain’ NEB
                regulated facilities. The audit focused on the patrol activities
                conducted as required by sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <strong>Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring</strong>, of the
                NEB Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings of the audit are based upon an assessment of
                whether TMPU was compliant with the regulatory requirements
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The National Energy Board Act;</li>
                <li>The National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations;</li>
                <li>
                  The National Energy Board Damage Prevention Regulations;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z662 &ndash; 15 &ndash;
                  Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems; and TMPU’s policies, programs,
                  practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                TMPU was required to demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness
                of the methods it has selected and employed within its
                management system and programs to meet the regulatory
                requirements listed above. Throughout this audit, the Board
                evaluated patrol activities in the context of the protection
                programs and the management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon receipt of the final Audit Report, TMPU is required to file
                with the Board for approval, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) that
                describes the methods and timing for addressing the
                non-compliances identified through this audit. The CAP shall be
                filed within 30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report being issued
                by the Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will post the approved CAP public on the website and
                will continue to monitor and assess all of TMPU’s corrective
                actions with respect to this audit until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the
                implementation and effectiveness of TMPU’s management system and
                programs through targeted compliance verification activities as
                a part of its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and environmental protection.
                Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to
                incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s audit of the above ground
                monitoring and surveillance activities (collectively referred to
                as patrol activities) implemented by Trans Mountain ULC (TMPU)
                for its NEB-regulated pipeline facilities. The audit focussed on
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <strong>Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring</strong> of the
                National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program
                Audit Protocol published in July 2013. Given the scope of this
                audit, it also included the requirements contained within the
                Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline
                Companies (DPR-O) and the Canadian Standards Association- Oil
                and Gas Pipeline Systems (CSA&nbsp;Z662-15).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit using two sets of protocols. The
                protocol in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> focused on the
                requirements for patrol activities described in
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1: Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring. In
                <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>, the Board evaluated how
                the company’s patrol activities are linked to the other elements
                of the TMPU’s management system information inputs and outputs.
                These links are indicators of the level to which a management
                system is implemented at the program activity level.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, the Board verified that TMPU conducts several
                types of ROW patrol activities to identify and report hazards
                and potential hazards on its rights-of-way. TMPU also
                demonstrated that it leverages its patrol activities to inform
                its Integrity and Environmental Protection Programs. The Board
                also found that TMPU was able to demonstrate that the majority
                of its management system processes had been integrated with the
                patrol activities. Detailed assessments are provided in
                Appendix&nbsp;I and II of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of the audit, the Board identified
                non-compliances in the following areas:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;1: TMPU’s draft Land Use Monitoring Standard was
                  not implemented at the time of the audit
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;2: TMPU did not demonstrate that it is
                  documenting its assessment of all the issues listed in
                  CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;3: TMPU’s legal list as it pertains to patrols is
                  maintained at an insufficient level of detail
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;4: TMPU has not established and implemented a
                  process for identifying and verifying competencies of its
                  contractors with respect to its patrol activities
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;5: TMPU did not demonstrate that its
                  communication plan was fully implemented as required by the
                  OPR.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued, TMPU
                must develop and submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for Board
                approval. The CAP must outline how TMPU intends to resolve the
                non-compliances identified by this audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will verify that the corrective actions are completed
                in a timely manner and applied consistently across TMPU’s
                system. The Board will continue to monitor the implementation
                and effectiveness of TMPU’s management system and programs
                through targeted compliance verification activities as part of
                its ongoing regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; the safety of the pipeline and property; and
                protection of the environment, the Board has developed
                regulations requiring companies to establish and implement
                documented management systems applicable to specified technical
                management and protection programs. These management systems and
                programs must take into consideration all applicable
                requirements of the NEB Act and its associated regulations, as
                well as the Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II. The Board’s
                management system requirements are described within the OPR,
                sections&nbsp;6.1 through&nbsp;6.6.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit is one in a series of focused audits that the Board
                is conducting of company right of way (ROW) patrol activities
                and is focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <strong>Inspection, Measuring and Monitoring</strong> of the
                National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program
                Audit Protocol published in July 2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board developed its audit protocols to verify that company
                patrol activities are compliant with the requirements,
                appropriately implemented and managed. During the audit, the
                Board reviews documentation and samples records provided by the
                company in its demonstration of compliance and interviews
                corporate and regionally-based staff. The Board also conducts
                inspections of a representative sample of company facilities.
                This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness
                and implementation of the management system and programs. The
                Board bases the scope and location of the inspections on the
                needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard
                inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the
                audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If
                unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an
                inspection, they are enforced as set out by the Board’s standard
                inspection and enforcement practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board develops and
                issues a Draft Audit Report (this document). The Draft Audit
                Report is submitted to the company for its review and to provide
                the company the opportunity to submit its comments to the Board.
                The Board will take the company’s comments into consideration
                before issuing the Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report
                outlines the Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations
                of the company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory
                requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the
                company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to
                address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports are
                published on the Board’s website. The audit results are
                integrated into the NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to
                compliance assurance.

              <p>
                The NEB expects pipeline companies to operate in a systematic,
                comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board
                expects companies to have effective, fully developed and
                implemented management systems and protection programs that
                provide for continual improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and
                maintain effective management systems and protection programs in
                order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions
                that may adversely affect the safety and security of the
                company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as
                the protection of property and the environment.

                In fiscal year 2016/17 the Board is piloting a new approach to
                audits. It identified the need to conduct a series of audits
                focused on company patrol activities. This decision was based on
                an internal analysis of compliance data and application of the
                NEB risk model. This model combines different aspects of the
                pipeline system’s location, product etc. with the companies’
                performance in other compliance areas. Trans Mountain Pipelines
                ULC. (TMPU) was therefore selected to be audited based on its
                compliance history and relative risk presented by its pipeline
                system. This audit focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.1,
                <strong>Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring</strong> of the
                National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program
                Audit Protocol, published in July 2013, which has the following

              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to evaluate TMPU’s performance
                against the applicable requirements specifically as they relate
                to patrol activities. The scope of the audit focused on
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1 of the Board’s audit protocol to verify
                that patrol activities are adequately identifying issues noted
                on the rights-of way to promote environmental protection,
                pipeline integrity, emergency response, security and damage
                prevention. The Board also examined the degree to which patrol
                activities were integrated with the company’s management system
                to ensure the protection of the environment and the safety and
                security of the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit was based on the requirements for federally regulated
                pipeline companies to conduct patrols of their rights of way to
                actively monitor hazards and potential hazards that could
                jeopardize the safety of people and the environment. The
                information gathered and issues observed by patrol activities
                must be communicated to the appropriate protection programs for
                tracking and resolution. Equally important, the hazards
                identified by the protection programs must inform the patrol
                activities to promote effective monitoring of these hazards. For
                this audit, TMPU was audited against the requirements contained
                within the following legal requirements as they relate to patrol
                activities:

              <p>
                The Board informed TMPU of its intention to audit its NEB
                regulated facilities in a letter dated 15&nbsp;August 2016.
                Following the issuance of this letter, Board audit staff met
                with TMPU to arrange and coordinate this audit. The Board also
                provided TMPU with the audit protocols (Appendices&nbsp;I and
                II), an information request guidance document as well as
                discussion questions to help TMPU prepare for the audit, and
                provide access to documentation and records to demonstrate its
                compliance. <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> is divided into
                five sections, with each section covering a partial component of
                the Board’s expectations for sub-element&nbsp;4.1. In
                <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>, the Board’s Audit
                Protocol identifies five&nbsp;Management System elements which
                are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each
                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. As
                this audit is focussed on patrol activities and related inputs
                and outputs from other protection programs, many of the
                processes required by the OPR were considered within the scope
                of this audit. TMPU established a digital access portal for
                Board staff to review documentation and records.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 9&nbsp;September 2016, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from TMPU in Calgary, Alberta to confirm the
                Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. The opening meeting
                was followed by various field level audit activities as
                described in the table below. Throughout the audit, Board audit
                staff gave TMPU daily summaries which included requests for
                additional documentation and interviews.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 28&nbsp;November 2016, the Board sent a pre-closeout
                information request to TMPU. This document outlined where gaps
                in information were identified during field activities,
                interviews and documentation review to date. An audit close-out
                meeting was held on 20&nbsp;December 2016 to provide TMPU with a
                description of the recommendations that staff would be bringing
                to the Board for decision.

              <h2 id="s5">5.0 Summary of Audit Findings</h2>
              <p>
                During this audit, TMPU was required to demonstrate the adequacy
                and effectiveness of its management system, programs and its
                processes as they relate to pipeline patrols. The Board reviewed
                documentation and records provided by TMPU, conducted
                inspections and interviewed TMPU’s staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of TMPU’ regulated facilities found TMPU is
                conducting several types of ROW patrol activities for its NEB
                regulated facilities and that TMPU has implemented processes for
                the reporting of potential unauthorized activities noted during
                patrol activities as required by the DPR-O. The Board verified
                that TMPU has integrated its patrol activities into the majority
                of the management system sub-elements including the policy and
                commitment, hazard identification, risk assessment and control,
                goals, objectives and targets, management of change and
                management review. However, the Board noted five findings of
                non-compliance related to: monitoring of adjacent lands;
                observing conditions and activities; failure to demonstrate an
                adequate list of legal requirements; lack of process to evaluate
                the contractors conducting patrol activities; and failure to
                demonstrate that its internal communication plan had been fully
                implemented:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;1: TMPU’s draft Land Use Monitoring Standard was
                  not implemented at the time of the audit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;2: TMPU did not demonstrate that it is
                  documenting its assessment of all the issues noted in
                  CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;3: The Board noted that, at the time of the
                  audit, TMPU’s legal list as it pertains to patrols is
                  maintained at an insufficient level of detail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;4: TMPU has not established and implemented a
                  process for identifying and verifying competencies of its
                  contractors with respect to its patrol activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding&nbsp;5: TMPU did not demonstrate that its internal
                  communication plan was fully implemented as required by the
                  OPR.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive
                commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and
                environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s
                regulation must establish and implement effective management
                systems in their day-to-day operations. In conducting this
                review, the Board has determined that TMPU is conducting patrol
                activities and its management system, for the most part, has
                been consistently implemented with regards to its patrol
                activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon receipt of the final report, TMPU must develop a corrective
                action plan describing its proposed methods to resolve the
                non-compliances identified in Appendices&nbsp;I and II and the
                timeline in which corrective actions will be completed. TMPU is
                required to submit its corrective action plan for Board approval
                within 30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report being issued. The
                Board will make its final Audit Report and TMPU’s approved
                corrective action plan public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of TMPU’s corrective
                actions to confirm they are completed in a timely manner and on
                a system wide basis until they are fully implemented. The Board
                will also continue to monitor the overall implementation and
                effectiveness of TMPU’s patrol activities.

              <h2 id="s7">7.0 Audit Terminology and Definitions</h2>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following definitions and
                explanations in measuring the various requirements included in
                this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or
                guidance and practices established by the Board, where
                available.)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements, and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> Addresses the
                non-compliances identified in the audit report, and explains the
                methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent
                basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented,
                meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for
                three&nbsp;months.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements
                of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff have been
                trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff
                and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated
                use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews
                have provided evidence of full implementation of the
                requirement, as prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are
                not partially utilized).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Inventory:</strong> A documented compilation of required
                items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be
                integrated into the management system and management system
                processes without further definition or analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>List:</strong> A documented compilation of required
                items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be
                integrated into the management system and management system
                processes without further definition or analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5 (1)&nbsp;(o). With records, the company
                must demonstrate that it meets the records management
                requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(p).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR
                sections&nbsp;6.1 to 6.6. It is a systematic approach designed
                to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote continual
                improvement. The system includes the organizational structures,
                resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and procedures
                required for the organization to meet its obligations related to
                safety, security and environmental protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to
                its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set
                out in OPR sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in
                evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers
                more than the specific requirements of Section&nbsp;6.1. It
                considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and
                implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its
                management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its
                organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6.&nbsp;4;
                and considers the establishment, implementation, development
                and/or maintenance of the processes, inventory and list
                described in section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in
                sections&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;(c) and (d), the company’s management
                system and processes must apply and be applied to the programs
                described in section&nbsp;55.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must
                be developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Practice:</strong> A repeated or customary action that
                is well understood by the persons authorized to carry it out.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order, thereby allowing
                individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe
                manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities
                and authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that
                take place in an established order and are directed toward a
                specific result. A process also outlines the roles,
                responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A
                process may contain a set of procedures, if required.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management system processes
                applicable to its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) establishes the basic requirements for
                management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                developed or maintained as described within each section;
                whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                designed to address the requirements of the process, for example
                a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and
                potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required
                actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for
                staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The
                Board considers this to constitute a common 5 w’s and h approach
                (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that
                the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may
                therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as
                they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate
                any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR section.
                Processes may incorporate or contain linkage to procedures,
                where required to meet the process requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the processes constitute part of the management system, the
                required processes must be developed in a manner that allows
                them to function as part of the system. The system requirements
                are described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must be
                designed in a manner that contributes to the company following
                its policies and goals established and required by
                section&nbsp;6.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1) indicates that each
                process must be part of the management system
                <strong>and</strong> the programs referred to in OPR
                section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be compliant, the process must
                also be designed in a manner which considers the specific
                technical requirements associated with each program and is
                applied to and meets the process requirements within each
                program. The Board recognizes that a single process may not meet
                all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to
                establish governance processes as long as they meet the process
                requirements (as described above) and direct the program
                processes to be established and implemented in a consistent
                manner that allows for the management system to function as
                described in 6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program
                outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in
                other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company
                regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the
                program is achieving the intended results.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB
                regulations.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The program must include details on the activities to be
                completed including what, by whom, when, and how. The program
                must also include the resources required to complete the
                activities.

                <p>
                  The Board expects companies to have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for inspecting and
                  monitoring the company’s activities and facilities to evaluate
                  the adequacy and effectiveness of the protection programs. In
                  order to verify the implementation of the right-of-way (ROW)
                  monitoring activities, the NEB attended a selection of aerial
                  and vehicle ROW patrols conducted in both urban and rural
                  settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given the scope of this audit, these processes and protection
                  programs were not reviewed for compliance or adequacy. Rather,
                  the Board conducted a focused audit of the company’s pipeline
                  patrol activities which is typically part of the surveillance
                  and monitoring program. Patrol activities are one method used
                  by companies to monitor the effectiveness of the protection
                  programs. The review in this appendix relates directly to the
                  patrol activities that TMPU had in place at the time of the
                  audit. The Board noted that at the time of the audit, TMPU was
                  conducting the following types of ROW patrols:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Ground Patrol &ndash; TMPU has established ground patrol
                    schedules for certain sections of its ROW in Vancouver and
                    Edmonton based on levels of third party activity.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Aerial Patrol &ndash; TMPU’s rights of way are patrolled by
                    helicopter. The Aerial Right of Way Patrol scope of work
                    outlines the various patrol routes and frequency. Each
                    flight has an observer who is responsible for identifying
                    potential hazards and communicating issues to the ground
                    crews in each region. These contract employees use GIS
                    information obtained from TMPU to identify areas of known
                    activity along the ROW and alert each area if other
                    activities are present. The observer communicates with TMPU
                    staff when the helicopter is entering their area. The scope
                    of work for these inspections focuses on the identification
                    and reporting of potential unauthorized activity, but TMPU
                    also demonstrated that it uses its aerial patrol to identify
                    and monitor natural hazards through established
                    communication practices.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Natural Hazards &ndash; TMPU’s Pipeline Integrity Group has
                    contracted an engineering firm specifically to monitor areas
                    where the potential exists for naturally occurring
                    hydrotechnical, geotechnical and seismic hazards along its
                    rights-of way. Internally referred to as the “natural
                    hazards” program, it manages the proactive identification,
                    documentation, monitoring and resolution of geotechnical
                    issues. Reports are issues they submit include site
                    observations, photographs and depth of cover measurements
                    and recommendations for further inspection, mitigation and
                    additional aerial or ground patrol monitoring. This program
                    includes:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        an annual two week ground patrol/inspection of the
                        entire pipeline system
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        ongoing support for the identification, monitoring and
                        resolution of any “natural hazards”
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        investigations of events on the ROW related to natural
                        hazards (e.g. landslides)
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Depth of Cover / Cathodic protection survey &ndash; Depth of
                    cover is monitored by the Integrity Team. While the scope of
                    this audit is limited to patrol activities, the Board notes
                    that TMPU has scheduled other activities in order to monitor
                    its depth of cover and cathodic protection. It has retained
                    contractors to undertake regular cathodic protection and
                    depth of cover surveys. Depth of cover data is entered into
                    the GIS system for ongoing monitoring.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Integrated Vegetation Management &ndash; Parts of TMPU’s ROW
                    is located in areas where vegetation that may potentially
                    interfere with the visibility and accessibility requires
                    ongoing monitoring and must include environmental
                    considerations related to species at risk. At the time of
                    the audit, this program document dated January 2016 was
                    marked “Final Draft”. Also, vegetation management is
                    described in TMPU’s implemented Right of Way Maintenance
                    Standard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Signage Maintenance Strategy &ndash; As part of its ROW
                    maintenance, TMPU staff photograph and geotag each of its
                    ROW markers. Inspections conducted during the audit verified
                    that signage was present in accordance with its procedures
                    and CSA requirements.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the
                  Board did not find any issues of non-compliance for this
                  aspect of the requirement.

                  1.2 Evaluating adequacy and taking corrective action
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The Board also requires companies to evaluate the adequacy and
                  effectiveness of the protection programs and for taking
                  corrective and preventive actions if deficiencies are
                  identified. During the audit, the Board reviewed records of
                  various types of patrol activities as part of its surveillance
                  and monitoring program. TMPU was able to demonstrate that it
                  has established practices to identify, evaluate, track,
                  communicate and resolve issues related to hazards and
                  potential hazards on the rights &ndash;of &ndash;way
                  identified on patrols.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the Board determined that the internal communication
                  plan was not yet fully implemented (see sub-element&nbsp;3.5
                  of <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>), TMPU provided
                  documentation demonstrating that it has established practices
                  for the communication and tracking of ROW issues. At the time
                  of the audit, TMPU provided records related to its Natural
                  Hazards Program, depth of cover and unauthorized activities to
                  demonstrate that these issues were identified by patrols and
                  then communicated to the appropriate team for evaluation and
                  tracking and resolution. Based on the review of the records,
                  the Board is satisfied that TMPU demonstrated it had practices
                  in place to meet this requirement.
                </p>

                  The National Energy Board Damage Prevention Regulations
                  &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies (DPR-O) requirements
                  came into effect on 19&nbsp;June 2016. The DPR-O requires that
                  companies develop a Damage Prevention Program which includes
                  ongoing monitoring of any changes in the use of the land on
                  which a pipeline is located and the land that is adjacent to
                  that land. Guidance provided by the Board indicates that the
                  monitoring of lands adjacent to the ROW should include the
                  monitoring of changes in the use of the land on which a
                  pipeline is located and the adjacent land is required in order
                  for a company to effectively identify hazards and manage the
                  risks related to pipeline damage prevention over time.

                  At the time of the audit, TMPU provided a draft copy Land Use
                  Monitoring Standard for review. In interviews, TMPU staff
                  stated that this standard was developed to reflect the
                  requirements of the DPR-O. As this standard had not been
                  approved or implemented at the time of the audit, it was not
                  reviewed during the audit to verify its adequacy or compliance
                  to the DPR-O.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Although TMPU provided its draft Land Use Monitoring Standard
                  for review, this document was not implemented at the time of
                  the audit. As a result, the Board has determined that TMPU is
                  in non-compliance with DPR-O s.16 (b). The Board requires that
                  a CAP be developed to address this non-compliance.

                  (CSA&nbsp;clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1)
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The Board reviewed TMPU’s procedures and report samples for
                  both its aerial and ground patrols. TMPU was able to
                  demonstrate that it has established several types of patrol
                  activities to monitor its rights of way and that these patrols
                  resulted in the identification of potential hazards on the
                  rights of way such as unauthorized third party activity. In
                  addition to its Damage Prevention Program, TMPU has integrated
                  its patrols into its Integrity and Environmental Management
                  programs in order to identify and monitor natural hazards such
                  as areas of potential scour and soil slides. TMPU has long
                  term contracts with expert third parties to conduct ongoing
                  monitoring of geo-hazards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The aerial patrol report templates contain reference to third
                  party activity, evidence of leakage and unsatisfactory surface
                  conditions on/ adjacent to the pipeline. A review indicates
                  Ground patrol fills out a Stakeholder contact form which
                  includes a list of “issue types” including damage prevention
                  and vegetation management, its Pipeline Procedures includes a
                  list of “any indication of activities or events”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the review of the report templates used for both ground
                  and aerial patrol, the Board found that the templates do not
                  explicitly include the potential hazards as identified in
                  TMPU’s procedures or that are listed in CSA. Instead these
                  reports stated either “no sightings or any incidents of
                  concern” or listed potential unauthorized activities. Although
                  the procedures for both the aerial and ground patrol include
                  lists of potential hazards that should be monitored during
                  patrols, the reports from these patrols do not confirm with
                  documentation that an assessment of the various potential
                  issues has occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board is of the view that reporting only what is out of
                  the norm, or by exception, does not typically allow for an
                  adequate demonstration of the ongoing monitoring of developing
                  trends that can affect the safety and operation of the
                  pipeline. Also, this type of reporting does not provide
                  documentation to confirm that an assessment of the potential
                  issues as identified in CSA has occurred during the patrols.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Due to the fact that both the aerial and ground patrols report
                  by exception, that is, only note when an issue is present,
                  TMPU could not demonstrate that it is documenting its
                  assessment of all the issues as noted in CSA&nbsp;Z662-15
                  clause&nbsp;10.6.1. As a result, the Board has determined that
                  TMPU is in non-compliance with this requirement. The Board
                  requires that a CAP be developed to address this
                  non-compliance.

                  2.3 Frequency of inspections (CSA&nbsp;clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2)
                </h4>
                <p>
                  TMPU’s procedure document titled The Conducting Right of Way
                  Ground Patrol, section&nbsp;2.3 outlines the considerations
                  for scheduling of patrol activities. The list includes the
                  majority of the factors listed in CSA for consideration. TMPU
                  has included a list of factors to be considered in its
                  determination of pipeline patrol frequency that reflects the
                  requirements outlined in CSA in order to address the factors
                  for its ROW (Section&nbsp;2.3.2 of its DP Manual- Pipeline
                  protection procedures.)TMPU’s list includes: environmentally
                  sensitive areas, land use, population density, access, level
                  of construction activity and topography. Upon review of TMPU’s
                  list of factors, the Board is of the view that TMPU has
                  established a list of criteria for the scheduling of patrols
                  that is appropriate to its system and therefore meets the
                  intention of CSA&nbsp;10.6.1.2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TMPU also demonstrated that these factors are considered in a
                  regular review for determining ongoing suitability of pipeline
                  patrol schedule for both ROW patrol and natural hazard
                  patrols. The Board also notes that the Damage Prevention
                  Program tracks the number of kilometers patrolled and number
                  of issues identified in its annual reporting to Senior
                  Management to measure the impact and effectiveness of these
                  activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TMPU’s has established an aerial patrol frequency for each
                  section that varies from weekly to monthly depending on time
                  of year. In addition to its regular patrols, TMPU also
                  dispatches extra patrols to monitor issues such as potential
                  natural hazards and environment concerns.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the
                  Board did not find any issues of non-compliance for this
                  aspect of the requirement.

                  The Board requires the company to appoint an accountable
                  officer. The accountable officer must be given appropriate
                  authority over the company’s human and financial resources for
                  ensuring that the company meets its obligations for safety,

                  On 9&nbsp;May 2013, Trans Mountain Pipelines ULC. (TMPU)
                  submitted written notice to the Board indicating that its
                  President, Ian Anderson, had been appointed as the accountable
                  officer. In its submission, TMPU confirmed that its
                  accountable officer has the authority over the human and
                  financial resources required to meet the Board’s expectations.

                  TMPU provided its Policy on Environment, Health and Safety
                  (EHS), as signed by the President dated November 2012. During
                  the audit, the Board noted that the policies were available to
                  employees and part of the management system. The policy
                  statements include commitments to not harming people and
                  protecting the environment. It also includes the circumstances
                  under which disciplinary action for those that knowingly
                  engage in or condone environmental health or safety
                  violations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board also noted that the EHS policy has been integrated
                  by TMPU’s employees and contractors when conducting patrols.
                  During the interviews with staff and contractors, they
                  referred to their personal accountability for the safety of
                  the pipeline when performing patrol-related activities. These
                  employees and contractors described personal authority and
                  obligation to intervene with third parties to ensure that the
                  procedures were being adhered to during activities along the
                  rights-of-way.

                <h5>NEB Assessment</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board expects companies to have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for identifying and
                  analyzing all hazards and potential hazards. In addition, the
                  Board expects companies to establish and maintain an inventory
                  of hazards and potential hazards. Although the review of the
                  hazard identification process is outside the scope of this
                  audit, the Board examined the methods and the extent to which
                  the identification, tracking and evaluation of hazards was
                  reflected within TMPU’s patrol activities.
                </p>
                <h6>Identifying Hazards and Potential Hazards</h6>
                <p>
                  In order to demonstrate that it has integrated its patrol
                  activities with hazard identification, TMPU provided its risk
                  register for review. At the time of the audit, this register
                  was managed and maintained manually to track and assess types
                  of hazards and potential hazards. It includes the inherent and
                  residual risk and identifies the mitigating measures in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through interviews with staff and records provided for review,
                  TMPU demonstrated how hazards or potential hazards identified
                  by patrols are initially documented on the Integrity Hazard
                  Identification forms. Once reported, hazards are evaluated,
                  assessed and assigned for monitoring. If mitigation is
                  required, it is tracked through work orders. New types of
                  hazards are added to the Pipeline Protection Risk Register for
                  evaluation and tracking. For the Damage Prevention Program, a
                  form is completed and sent to Integrity in Calgary to assess
                  the hazard and determine the follow-up action required. If
                  this was a new hazard, it would be added to the risk registry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TMPU also provided documentation to demonstrate how the
                  identification of hazards within the protection programs has
                  resulted in changes to the patrols. For example, extra patrols
                  were recommended by the Natural Hazards program to monitor
                  areas along the ROW impacted by the Spring freshet. Upon
                  further assessment of the hazard, Spring patrols were added to
                  the schedule for every May and June.
                </p>
                <h6>Analysis of Hazards and Potential Hazards</h6>
                <p>
                  At the time of the audit, TMPU staff demonstrated that hazards
                  identified on the ROW were reported through the distribution
                  of patrol reports and the risk register assessment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TMPU has several programs that are linked to the
                  identification of hazards on its ROW. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Ground / Aerial patrols of urban, rural and remote areas.
                    Patrol reports are distributed throughout the protection
                    programs for review. During the audit, TMPU provided
                    documentation demonstrating that it had conducted an
                    analysis of the occurrences of potential unauthorized
                    activities reported on or near its ROW to senior management.
                    Included in the analysis, many of these occurrences were
                    discovered during patrol activities. This information was
                    communicated to the Public Awareness Program.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Natural Hazards Program &ndash; Based in the Integrity
                    Program, this program tracks hazards and potential hazards
                    that arise because of terrain as well as those that develop
                    due to seasonal conditions along the ROW such as annual
                    freshets and the impact of spring thaw on water crossings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cathodic Protection Survey/ Depth of Cover &ndash; Based in
                    the Integrity Program, this program manages surveys of the
                    ROW that are conducted and obtains depth of cover
                    information which is stored in the GIS system for ongoing
                    monitoring.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The Board is of the view that TMPU has established patrol
                  activities and has linked those activities to its hazard
                  identification and risk evaluation processes.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Based on the review of documents provided, the Board noted
                  that TMPU was able to demonstrate that it has established
                  patrol activities as controls for hazards on the ROW including
                  natural hazards. The audit found that TMPU conducts frequent
                  and various types of patrols, as discussed in
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report.

                  System (ISLMS). Section&nbsp;10 of the ISLMS document
                  describes KMC’s process for monitoring of legal requirements
                  for the Trans Mountain Pipelines. TMPU also provided the Legal
                  Requirements Standard. Although TMPU’s overall compliance
                  monitoring processes was not in scope for this audit, the
                  legal list as it relates to the patrol activities was
                  requested for review. TMPU provided its legal list which
                  included the titles of :
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Federal and provincial acts and regulations;</li>
                  <li>Board Certificates and Orders;</li>
                  <li>CSA Standards; and</li>
                  <li>Other international standards.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  At the time of the audit, TMPU was updating its process for
                  maintaining its legal list to increase its integration into
                  the ISLMS and to break it down to the requirement level. TMPU
                  estimates that this project will be complete and implemented
                  in 2017. Also, TMPU was in the process of updating its
                  procedures to reflect the requirements of the Damage
                  Prevention Regulations.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  TMPU demonstrated that it is tracking and listing legal
                  requirements and that its list included NEB Orders and
                  Certificates. However, the Board noted that, at the time of
                  the audit, the legal list as it pertains to patrols is
                  maintained at an insufficient level of detail. Therefore this
                  list is non-compliant with OPR&nbsp;6.5(1)&nbsp;(h). As a
                  result, the Board requires TMPU to develop a CAP to address
                  this deficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board notes that the legal list affects several
                  sub-elements within the management system as it relates to the
                  patrol activities. By addressing the deficiencies related to
                  the maintenance of the legal list, this list will impact
                  related processes such as Internal Audits and Document
                  Control.

                  TMPU provided its 2016 Integrated Safety and Loss Management
                  System goals, objectives and targets (GOTs). Through
                  documentation provided for the audit, TMPU demonstrated that
                  it has established GOTs for the prevention of releases and the
                  communication of hazards on the ROW at a corporate level which
                  it measures at the program level. For the Damage Prevention
                  Program, there are GOTs which are specifically related to
                  patrol activities, such as number of kilometers patrolled per
                  year and number of unauthorized activities identified. These
                  program goals are reflected in goals measured for staff
                  performance.

                  In its 2015 and 2016 Safety and Loss Management Dashboards,
                  TMPU illustrated its objectives and targets related to the
                  identification, communication and resolution of issues
                  identified on patrol. These goals are given targets that are
                  reported and measured annually. In addition, at the team
                  level, TMPU tracks its signage maintenance by tracking work
                  orders and number of kilometers patrolled.

                  requirements of its management system and its obligations to
                  carry out activities in a manner that ensures the safety and

                  During the audit, TMPU indicated that its Damage Prevention
                  group is primarily responsible for patrol activities.
                  According to the organizational chart provided, staff and
                  contractors that conduct patrols report to the Manager, Damage
                  Prevention and Public Awareness through supervisors for the
                  Western and Central Regions respectively. Interviews confirmed
                  staff are provided with job descriptions that include
                  responsibilities regarding patrols. Also, the contractors were
                  aware of their responsibilities outlined in the Statement of
                  Work which is reviewed annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along with a documented organizational structure, the Board
                  expects companies to demonstrate an ongoing ability to sustain
                  its activities. The Board requires that companies demonstrate
                  that the human resources required to establish and maintain
                  its activities are sufficient to meet operational and
                  regulatory requirements based on an annual documented
                  evaluation of need.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For patrol activities, TMPU includes the assessment of staff
                  levels within its documented Damage Prevention Annual Work
                  Plan. This plan includes an assessment of the various
                  activities performed by the Damage Prevention Team and was
                  introduced based on the OPR requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on the interviews and the documentation reviewed, the
                  Board is of the view that TMPU demonstrated it has been
                  conducting its evaluations of resource levels for patrols
                  since 2012. At that time, based on an assessment of activity
                  near the ROW, the Damage Prevention Team outlined the need for
                  full-time pipeline patrollers to address the requirements for
                  increased ground patrols in both operating regions.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that TMPU has an Organizational Structure
                  that meets the above expectations as they relate to its patrol
                  activities. Based on the review conducted and considering the

                  The Board requires that companies have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for developing and
                  implementing corrective, mitigative, preventive and protective
                  controls associated with the hazards and risks. Considering
                  that the scope of this audit is limited to the assessment of
                  patrol activities, and based on the information provided
                  during interviews and related inspections, the Board is of the
                  view that TMPU conducts patrol activities as part of its suite
                  of controls for hazards on the ROW.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As discussed in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this
                  report, TMPU conducts various types of patrol activities as a
                  control measure to monitor several types of hazards relating
                  to activities and conditions on the ROW. TMPU’s ROW
                  maintenance also includes sign maintenance and vegetation
                  management on its ROW. Inspections conducted during the audit
                  verified that signage was present and visible in the areas
                  observed including parks, residential neighbourhoods and
                  industrial areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board also requires companies to establish and implement a
                  process for coordinating and controlling the operational
                  activities of employees and other people working with or on
                  behalf of the company so that each person is aware of the
                  activities of others and has the information that will enable
                  them to perform their duties in a manner that is safe, ensures
                  the security of the pipeline and protects the environment.
                </p>
                Although patrol activities are managed by the Damage Prevention
                Program, they are also leveraged to monitor hazards identified
                by other programs, such as the Natural Hazards Program. TMPU has
                also utilized its aerial patrols to obtain information regarding
                environmental issues such as caribou migration. Another example
                of program integration is the ROW maintenance that involves
                input from the patrols, the Environment Team and Compliance Team
                to ensure the needs of each group are met with regards to
                brushing activities.
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that TMPU has a process that includes
                  patrols activities that meets the above expectations. Based on

                    incidents and emergency situations. The company shall also
                    define proposed responses to these events and prevent and
                    mitigate the likely consequence and/or impacts of these
                    events. The procedures must be periodically tested and
                    reviewed and revised where appropriate (for example, after
                    upset or abnormal events). The company shall have an
                    established, implemented and effective process for
                    developing contingency plans for abnormal events that may
                    occur during construction, operation, maintenance,
                    abandonment or emergency situations.

                <p>
                  Given the scope of this audit is focused on patrol activities,
                  the Board’s review of this sub-element was limited to
                  considering the role of patrol activities during upset
                  conditions. Considering that patrol activities are only relied
                  on for the identification of potential upset conditions, the
                  Board verified that TMPU has implemented procedures for
                  identifying and communicating potential upset conditions on
                  the ROW. Interviews with staff and contractors as well as a
                  review of the documentation confirmed procedures for the
                  communication of imminent hazards on the ROW are in place and
                  understood by staff and contractors.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Based on the scope of this audit and the information reviewed,
                  the Board did not identify any issues of non-compliance in
                  relation to sub-element&nbsp;3.2 Operational Control- Upset or

                  TMPU’s Management of Change is described in its Operational
                  Change Management Standard which is part of its Integrated
                  Safety and Loss Management System. Due to the scope of this
                  audit, this process was not reviewed for adequacy or
                  compliance to the OPR.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Specific to patrols, TMPU advised, that depending on the type
                  and nature of the change requested, the Change Management
                  Request Form triggers a series of reviews by stakeholders
                  across the organization. For example, once the changes to
                  documentation have been approved, the process includes that
                  older versions are removed and replaced. During the audit,
                  TMPU was able to demonstrate that this process was applied to
                  its patrol procedures.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that TMPU has a Management of Change (MOC)
                  process that is triggered by regulations that impact ROW
                  monitoring and surveillance. As a result, based on the scope
                  of this audit and the information reviewed, the Board did not
                  identify any areas of non-compliance with sub-element&nbsp;3.3

                <p>
                  The Board requires companies to have processes for developing
                  competency requirements and training programs that provide
                  employees and other persons working with or on behalf of the
                  company with the training that will enable them to perform
                  their duties in a manner that is safe, ensures the security of
                  the pipeline and protects the environment. Given that patrol
                  activities are the scope of this audit, the Board focused its
                  assessment of the training program and competency evaluations
                  on the expectations for staff and contractors who conduct
                  patrols.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At TMPU, staff training for patrol activities is contained
                  within the Knowledge and Experience Enhancement Program (KEEP)
                  and a Business Unit Training matrix is used to capture
                  training requirements for Pipeline Protection staff. TMPU
                  provided a description and skill packets for the three modules
                  that relate to ROW maintenance. Pipeline Protection staff
                  complete several skills packets including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Conducting Right-of-Way Patrols</li>
                  <li>Knowledge of the KMC Right-of-Way</li>
                  <li>Demonstrate Knowledge of Pipeline Protection Zones</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  TMPU also provided its “KMC Environmental Awareness” training
                  which includes a knowledge evaluation for participants. The
                  course is designed to introduce employees to aspects of the
                  Environmental Protection Plan and key environmental issues
                  associated with its operations. Competence of the patrollers
                  is confirmed through testing and reviewed during performance
                  reviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For aerial patrol, TMPU has outlined its expectations in the
                  scope of work which is reviewed annually. In addition, pilots
                  and observers attend a “Yearly- Aerial Patrol Training /
                  Review” which includes a presentation of potential hazards and
                  the expectation for reporting and communication. On occasion,
                  TMPU staff will also monitor contract pilots and observers
                  during the year but written evaluations are not completed. At
                  the time of the audit, TMPU advised that it was in the process
                  of developing its process for the evaluation of competence of
                  its contractors who conduct patrols.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In reviewing the training, the Board included the expectation
                  outlined in CSA&nbsp;clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1 that requires
                  “particular attention” be given to several possible activities
                  and conditions on the ROW. In section&nbsp;2.2 of
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report, the Board
                  clarified that it expects companies to report on the presence
                  of these conditions and activities. With this requirement in
                  mind, the Board is of the view that in order for these
                  conditions and activities to be identified by patrol and
                  reported as required, companies should demonstrate that these
                  topics are addressed in training. At the time of the audit,
                  TMPU could not confirm that its suite of training for
                  patrollers and contractors has not been evaluated to ensure
                  that it enables staff and contractors to identify the
                  conditions and activities as listed in
                  CSA&nbsp;clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  While TMPU demonstrated that it has developed and implemented
                  a process for identifying, tracking and managing training for
                  staff and contractors conducting patrols, and that it could
                  not confirm that its training provides patrol staff and
                  contractors with the adequate awareness to identify the issues
                  as listed in CSA. The Board also found that TMPU has not
                  established and implemented a process for identifying and
                  verifying competencies of its contractors with respect to its
                  patrol activities. As a result, the Board finds TMPU in
                  non-compliance with NEB OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(k). The Board
                  requires TMPU to develop a corrective action plan to address
                  the described deficiencies.

                  During the audit, TMPU provided documentation and records
                  indicating that it has external and internal processes for
                  communicating information and processes relating to its ROW
                  maintenance and surveillance program.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the audit, TMPU provided documentation to
                  demonstrate that it was communicating issues by practice. TMPU
                  was, however, unable to demonstrate a communication process or
                  procedure for the internal communication of issues related to
                  legal requirements, to staff and contractors who conduct
                  patrols. In addition, the audit reviewed several patrol
                  reports and noted that, through its Natural Hazards monitoring
                  program as well as its Depth of Cover monitoring, TMPU was
                  communicating issues noted on patrol to the appropriate
                  protection program to manage and resolve. Section&nbsp;8 of
                  the scope of work for aerial patrols outlines the Kinder
                  Morgan’s expectation for during patrols. Within the Damage
                  Prevention Team, communication occurs through regular meetings
                  and an annual pipeline protection forum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout this audit, the Board noted that TMPU demonstrated
                  that informal communication between teams is occurring
                  regarding issues on the ROW. TMPU provided several examples of
                  environmental, damage prevention and integrity related issues
                  that were initially reported by patrols and subsequently
                  assigned for resolution to another team. In addition examples
                  of the protection programs communicating issues to be
                  monitored by patrols were also provided. While TMPU’s internal
                  communication of these issues appears consistent and
                  pervasive, the Board noted that many of these communications
                  occur by practice in emails rather than as the result of a
                  documented communication plan. Also, it is unclear whether
                  these emails become part of the official files or if these
                  emails constitute adequate documentation of the communication
                  of these issues in accordance with its communication plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the time of the audit, TMPU was implementing an Internal
                  Communication Standard at the corporate level and
                  communication plans at the team level as part of its ongoing
                  ISLMS implementation. TMPU provided its Internal Communication
                  Standard document for review. TMPU indicated that, at the time
                  of the audit, it was in the process of implementing its
                  internal communication plan for the Damage Prevention Team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the external communication plan is largely the
                  responsibility of the Public Awareness and Lands departments,
                  and therefore outside the scope of this audit, the Board
                  included aspects of external communication for safety on the
                  ROW by reviewing the contents of TMPU’s external website. The
                  Board noted that TMPU has posted information related to its
                  patrols as well as safety information relating to call before
                  you dig.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  While TMPU demonstrated that there is communication of issues
                  concerning the ROW from the patrollers to the programs as well
                  as from the programs to the patrols, it did not demonstrate
                  that this communication was occurring as the result of a
                  documented communication plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on the Board’s evaluation of TMPU’s communication
                  practices against the requirements and the scope of this
                  audit, the Board has determined that TMPU is non-compliant
                  with NEB OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(m). TMPU will have to develop
                  corrective actions to address the described deficiencies.

                <h5>NEB Assessment</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board expects to have an established, implemented and
                  effective process for identifying the documents required for
                  the company to meet its obligations to conduct activities in a
                  manner that ensures the safety and security of the public,
                  company employees, the pipeline, and protection of property
                  and the environment. TMPU’s Integrated Safety and Loss
                  Management System, Section&nbsp;5, the Controlled Document
                  Standard, is the overarching document management procedure.
                  According to the document, this standard describes the
                  requirements for the maintenance and management of controlled
                  documents including those relating to ROW surveillance. Due to
                  the scope of this audit, the Board focused its review on the
                  examination of procedures and templates related to patrol
                  activities which are managed by the Damage Prevention Team.
                </p>
                <p>At the time of the audit, TMPU was able to demonstrate:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    it was undertaking annual reviews and updates to its
                    procedures;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    regulatory changes did trigger a review of procedures;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    staff are trained on the controlled document standard;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    controlled documents were accessible to staff on a shared
                    drive;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    procedures relating to ROW patrol were subject to the
                    guidelines of the document hierarchy;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the procedures related to ROW patrols were subject to the
                    Operational Change Management Standard; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    changes to the documentation were communicated to staff.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Upon examination of the content of the procedures, however,
                  the Board noted deficiencies noted elsewhere in this audit
                  will impact the procedures and templates related to patrol
                  activities. At the time of the audit, the Board noted
                  deficiencies within the patrol procedures that relate to the
                  failure to adequately maintain its legal references. For
                  example, patrol procedures were not updated to reflect the
                  changes in the DPR. For example the Pipeline Protection
                  Management System (September 2012) still refers to the NEB
                  Pipeline Crossing Regulations which were repealed in June of
                  2016. Also, it appears to have not been updated for
                  CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, or 15 or the update to the OPR in 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In consideration of the fact that this audit is a review of
                  the impact of the management system on the patrol activities,
                  the Board has determined that the root cause of this
                  deficiency is directly related to TMPU’s lack of integration
                  of its legal list which is discussed in section&nbsp;2.2 of
                  this appendix. Once the legal list is complete it will be
                  integrated into the documents in accordance with the document
                  control standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, deficiencies were noted in
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report relating to
                  a lack of documenting the potential hazards as listed in CSA.
                  The Board is of the view that addressing that deficiency will
                  impact the templates used by staff and contractors conducting
                  patrols.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that TMPU Document Control process that
                  applies to the procedures related to pipeline patrols. As a
                  result, based on the scope of this audit and the information
                  reviewed, the Board did not identify any areas of
                  non-compliance with sub-element&nbsp;3.6 Documents and
                  Document Control.

                  potential hazards, incidents and near-misses, and for taking
                  corrective and preventive actions. Given the focused scope of
                  this audit, the Board evaluated the processes described in the
                  expectations for this sub-element only as they related to
                  patrol activities.

                </h6>
                <p>
                  Through document and record reviews, the Board confirmed that
                  TMPU had implemented a procedure for reporting and tracking
                  third party unauthorized activities as well as natural hazards
                  such as landslides and erosion. Patrol reports are distributed
                  to several operational teams including Damage Prevention and
                  Integrity. TMPU demonstrated that in the event a potential
                  unauthorized activity is reported by patrols, field personnel
                  are dispatched to conduct a follow-up investigation to
                  determine if damage to the facilities or environment had
                  occurred. Also, TMPU demonstrated that issues relating to
                  integrity and environmental hazards were communicated to the
                  Integrity Team to manage and resolve.
                </p>
                <h6>Trending and Analysis</h6>
                <p>
                  Given that the scope of this audit is limited to patrols, the
                  Board reviewed which, if any aspect, of the patrol activities
                  were subject to periodic review. Based on interviews and
                  documentation provided, the Board verified that TMPU was
                  conducting trending and analysis of information obtained by
                  patrols such as the identification of unauthorized activities
                  by patrols. In its annual internal reporting, TMPU also
                  includes the number of kilometers patrolled, the number of
                  issues identified by patrols as well method of detection of
                  issues on the ROW. It uses these statistics in order to
                  monitor ongoing effectiveness of the patrol method, timing and
                  frequency. These trends are communicated to various levels
                  through quarterly reporting and at annual meetings of the
                  pipeline protection staff.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that TMPU has an established process to
                  evaluate and track issues to resolutions that includes those
                  issues identified by patrols. As a result, based on the scope
                  of this audit and the information reviewed, the Board did not
                  identify any areas of non-compliance with sub-element&nbsp;4.2

                <p>
                  The Board expects companies to have an implemented and
                  effective quality assurance program for the management system
                  and for each protection program, including a process for
                  conducting regular inspections and audits and for taking
                  corrective and preventive actions if deficiencies are
                  identified. Considering the scope of this audit, the Board
                  only evaluated the quality assurance program as it applies to
                  the patrol activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the audit, TMPU provided its 2015 Damage Prevention
                  compliance audit which was conducted by an expert third party.
                  The findings from this audit were documented and managed by
                  the Kinder Morgan Canada (KMC) Compliance Department with
                  corrective reviews and updates taking place quarterly.
                  Although this audit was conducted prior to the OPR requirement
                  for an audit of the Damage Prevention Program, the Board notes
                  that the protocol for this audit did not include OPR
                  section&nbsp;39 (Surveillance and Monitoring Program) or
                  applicable CSA requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the fact that the audit protocols applied to the
                  internal audit were incomplete, the Board has determined that
                  TMPU has an internal audit process in place that includes an
                  assessment of its patrol and damage prevention-related
                  activities. Furthermore, the Board has determined that the
                  root cause of this deficiency is directly related to TMPU’s
                  lack of a legal list which is discussed in section&nbsp;2.2 of
                  this appendix. Once the legal list is complete and integrated
                  into the quality assurance program, it should form the basis
                  for protocols for future audits.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that TMPU has an established process to
                  conduct internal audits and tracks findings to resolution. The
                  Board also notes that the CAP for sub-element&nbsp;2.2 of this
                  report will address the deficiencies with the audit protocols.
                  As a result, based on the scope of this audit and the
                  information reviewed, the Board did not identify any areas of
                  non-compliance with sub-element&nbsp;4.3 Internal Audit.

                  TMPU’s Damage Prevention team manages the records relating to
                  patrols including the patrol reports to reflect the
                  requirements of the corporate Records Management Standard.
                  Records managed by the Damage Prevention team include third
                  party permits and one call request verifications as well as
                  patrol reports. The Records Management Matrix outlines the
                  record owners, the types of records, and the review frequency
                  assigned to each type of record. According to matrix, these
                  reports are kept on a shared drive to be accessible to staff
                  and are the subject of an annual review. There is also a
                  monthly review of patrol records to verify that all
                  observations have been noted and assigned for follow-up. As
                  part of this audit, the Board reviewed several records related
                  to unauthorized activities on the ROW. TMPU was able to
                  provide files that included the assessment of the event and
                  photos as well as any follow-up that occurred.

                  Records relating to the Natural Hazards program, including
                  issues noted and monitored by patrols, are managed by a third
                  party in the Cambio database. This information is accessible
                  to the TMPU Integrity Team to facilitate ongoing monitoring.

                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>

                  The audit verified that TMPU has an established process to

                  The Board expects companies to have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for conducting an annual
                  management review of the management system and each protection
                  program. Given that the scope of this audit is focused solely
                  on patrol activities and its links to the management system,
                  the ISLMS was not reviewed or evaluated as part of the current
                  audit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this audit, the Board verified that several
                  sub-elements of the management system were linked to the
                  patrol activities including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>an EHS policy that reflects OPR requirements;</li>

                    an annual report as required by the OPR that includes
                    statistics related to patrol activities;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the inclusion of the Damage Prevention Program into its

                  Also, TMPU was able to demonstrate that Senior Management is
                  providing active oversight through its Quality Assurance Plan
                  and GOT dashboards. TMPU demonstrated that its Quality
                  Assurance Plan includes the Damage Prevention Program (which
                  includes patrols) by having an expert third party audit in
                  2015. Also, the Corporate GOT dashboards included aspects of
                  the patrol activities such as number of kilometres patrolled
                  and unauthorized activities reported which demonstrates that
                  these targets were reviewed at the Senior level. Also, TMPU
                  was able to demonstrate that its evaluation of need included
                  consideration of patrol activities in its overall
                  determination of staffing levels.
                </p>

                  The audit verified that TMPU has an established process to
                  conduct an annual management review which included information

                  result, based on the scope of this audit and the information
                  reviewed, the Board did not identify any areas of

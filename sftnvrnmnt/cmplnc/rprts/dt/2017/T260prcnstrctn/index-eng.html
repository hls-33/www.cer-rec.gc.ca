<p>Dear Mr. Anderson:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md">
<li><strong>Notification of the National Energy Board’s (Board or NEB) Final Audit Report Trans Mountain Pipelines ULC (TMPU)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On 13&nbsp;April 2017, the Board informed TMPU of its intent to audit the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (Project). The audit was focused on TMPU’s management system elements and sections of the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR) which were relevant to the scope of the audit. The objective of the audit was to determine if TMPU has established the necessary oversight measures to manage construction-related safety and environmental protection for construction of the Project.</p>
<p>A Draft Report documenting the Board’s evaluation of TMPU’s oversight measures to manage construction related safety of the project was provided to TMPU on 4&nbsp;August 2017 for review and comment. On 11&nbsp;August 2017, TMPU submitted its response and its Corrective Action Plan to address all of the Board’s findings.</p>
<p>After a review and evaluation of the feedback provided by TMPU, The Board has agreed to several minor edits to the audit report. In addition, the Board has included two new Appendices to the audit report: one which lists the company representatives interviewed during the audit; and the other is the Board-approved Corrective Action Plan (CAP).</p>
<p>The scope of the audit included relevant sections of the OPR for safety and environmental protection as they apply to the Project during the pre-construction phase. The regulatory requirements evaluated in this audit are detailed in the Board’s audit assessment tables, attached to the report. The Board’s findings were classified as Compliant, Non-Compliant, or Not Assessed.</p>
<div>
<p>The Board noted that several processes, programs and activities were not fully established at the time of the audit. In several instances this resulted in the Board finding that TMPU was not in compliance with the requirements of the OPR.</p>
<p>The Board found that there were non-compliances in the areas listed below, amongst others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality Assurance Program;</li>
<li>Hazard analyses;</li>
<li>Organizational structure and corresponding competency and training requirements;</li>
<li>Definition of inspection and monitoring requirements;</li>
</ul>
<p>In consideration of the findings of non-compliance, the Board concludes that, at the time of the audit, TMPU had not yet established the necessary oversight measures to manage construction-related safety and environmental protection during the construction of the Project.</p>
<p>The Board acknowledges that since the completion of on-site audit activities, TMPU has developed and submitted to the Board its CAP to rectify the non-compliances noted during the audit. The Board acknowledges TMPU’s pro-active efforts to demonstrate compliance for the findings of non-compliance.</p>
<p>The Board hereby approves TMPU’s CAP submitted by letter dated 11&nbsp;August 2017 in response to the findings identified in the Board’s audit with the exceptions noted herein.</p>
<p>The Board notes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>TMPU has included milestones for each CAP. These milestones will be verified during implementation assessment meetings planned for the period 28-30&nbsp;August, 2017.</li>
<li>Commitments described in the CAP will be verified during the implementation assessment meetings.</li>
<li>CAPs will be reviewed to verify that they include ongoing preventive measures to prevent recurrence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board finds TMPU’s proposed approach to address the deficiencies is acceptable for findings&nbsp;2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15. For all other findings refer to <a href="#nnxvii">Appendix&nbsp;VII</a> of the attached document for additional Board direction and guidance. All findings that were not accepted by the Board must be re-submitted by TMPU in as short a timeframe as possible to prevent delays in the start of construction.</p>
<p>The Board will post this Final Audit Report and the approved CAP on its website. Prior to publishing the report, TMPU will be offered an opportunity to review the report and request redactions based on the Access to Information Act. The Board will continue to monitor and assess all of TMPU’s corrective actions and areas that could not be assessed at the time of the audit to ensure the safety of people and the environment.</p>
</div>
<p>The Board will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of TMPU’s management system and programs through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its on-going regulatory approaches to oversee the Project’s construction and operation.</p>

Pre-Construction Compliance Audit Report<br>

<p class="text-center"><strong>Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC<br>

<h3 id="smmr">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>In accordance with Section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) conducted a compliance audit of Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC (TMPU) during the period from 12&nbsp;April to 2&nbsp;June 2017.</p>
<p>This report documents the Board’s audit of TMPU Expansion Project (TMEP or Project). The audit was focused on TMPU’s management practices and sections of the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR) which were relevant to the scope of the audit. The objective of the audit was to determine if TMPU has established the necessary oversight measures to manage construction-related safety and environmental protection during construction of the Project.</p>
<p>The Board conducted the audit using the audit protocols attached in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;1</a> of this report that are focused on safety and environmental protection as they apply to TMPU’s anticipated construction activities. The Board assessed whether TMPU’s documentation, processes and activities complied with the legal and other requirements under the Board’s authority listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NEB Act;</li>
<li>The OPR;</li>
<li>Any Conditions contained within applicable Certificates or Orders issued by the Board; and</li>
<li>Requirements of any applicable NEB Safety Advisories.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the audit, a number of process and program documents within the scope of the audit were assessed for compliance. Many of these documents relate to Conditions attached to the approval of the Project. Compliance to those Conditions are evaluated by the Board outside of this audit. As a result, this audit did not duplicate its assessment of these Conditions. The status of these Condition assessments can be reviewed on the NEB’s public website through the use of the <a href="/pplctnflng/mjrpp/trnsmntnxpnsn/cndtnstl-eng.html">Trans Mountain Interactive Conditions Tool</a><sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There were 37&nbsp;protocol items listed in the audit protocol attached in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;1</a>. Of those, there were 11 in which the Board did not identify any compliance issues; 1 was not assessed; 15 were found to be non-compliant; and 10 the Board was unable to assess at the time of the audit.</p>
<p>The Board identified a number of regulatory requirements that could not be definitively assessed as either compliant or non-compliant during the audit. This was due to the stage of Project development, i.e., the required process or program was not yet fully developed and they were not immediately required to be implemented by the Project at the time of the audit. In order for the Board to evaluate a process, program, or activity for compliance, the activity or process has to be evaluated against a specific regulatory requirement. If the process or activity being evaluated is not yet being carried out because it is not yet required for the Project, the Board is unable to assign a finding of either compliant or non-compliant. The Board will follow up on all protocol items that could not be assessed through additional compliance verification activities as part of its regulatory oversight of the Project.</p>
<p>In this audit, the Board found non-compliances as summarized below.</p>
<ul>
<li>TMPU was unable to demonstrate how the Project has been integrated into the TMPU management system (ISLMS) in a manner that meets the requirements of OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.1 (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap01">Protocol AP-TMPU-01</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU’s policy for the internal reporting of hazards, potential hazards, incidents and 
near-misses does not meet the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.3(1)(a) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap02">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-02</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU has not created an organizational structure for the Project which meets the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.4 (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1<a href="#ap03"> Protocol Items AP-TMPU-03</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU has not developed a process to identify all hazards and potential hazards or created a hazard inventory related to the Project in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(c) and (d) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 Protocol Items <a href="#ap12">AP-TMPU-12 and 13</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU has not analyzed all of the risks or developed corresponding controls associated with the Project hazards and potential hazards in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(e) and (f) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap14">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-14 </a>and <a href="#ap17">AP-TMPU-17</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU has not developed a management of change process which meets the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(m) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 Protocol Items <a href="#ap22">AP-TMPU-22</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU has not developed a process to communicate all special Conditions associated with the Project; all special safety practices and procedures necessitated by the NEB Conditions specific to the construction; and inform the contractor of the contractor’s responsibilities in a manner which meets the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(l) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap26">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-26</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU has not developed an inspection and monitoring plan for the Project in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(u) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap30">Protocol Items AP-TMPU-30</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU has not developed a process to ensure issues of concern and/or requiring immediate attention found during monitoring activities are properly addressed in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(u) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1<a href="#ap31"> Protocol Items AP-TMPU-31 and 32</a>);</li>
<li>TMPU was not implementing all of the requirements of its Quality Management Plan as per the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;15;</li>
<li>TMPU’s legal list does not include all referenced standards in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(h) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap36">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-36</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the evaluation of the results of its audit, the Board is of the view that, at the time of the audit, TMPU had not yet established all of the necessary oversight measures to manage construction-related safety and environmental protection for the construction Project.</p>
<p>The Board acknowledges that TMPU has submitted a proposed Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The Board has reviewed and approved this CAP, with guidance and direction as noted in the covering letter of this audit report. TMPU is required to implement its CAP in accordance with the methods and timelines described in the CAP at <a href="#nnxvii">Appendix&nbsp;VII</a> of this report. The Board will review the deliverables as outlined by TMPU’s CAP submission during implementation assessment meetings planned for the period August&nbsp;28-30, 2017. Each finding will be considered resolved when all of the deficiencies as described in the report have been addressed in accordance with the legal requirements, the commitments and the actions described in the CAP. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of TMPU’s management system and construction activities through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its ongoing regulatory oversight of the Project.</p>

<h2 id="s1">1.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>In accordance with Section&nbsp;49(3) of the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act), the National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) conducted a compliance audit of Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC (TMPU) during the period from 12&nbsp;April to 2&nbsp;June 2017. TMPU is an affiliate of Kinder Morgan Canada Inc. (KMC). An overview of the audit process and an explanation of definitions and abbreviations can be found in Appendices&nbsp;2&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;4.</p>
<h3 id="s1_1">1.1 Audit Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of this audit was to assure that TMPU has established the necessary oversight measures to manage construction-related safety and environmental protection considerations for its Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMEP or Project).</p>
<p>As the audit was focussed on the pre-construction phase of the Project, the Board only required TMPU to demonstrate that it had developed the necessary processes and activities for the Project. This audit did not test implementation as the construction activities had not yet been initiated at the time of the audit. The Board reviewed relevant processes, programs, and activities of the Project including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of the Project with TMPU’s management system;</li>
<li>Organizational Structure, Roles and Responsibilities;</li>
<li>Competency, Training and Evaluation;</li>
<li>Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control;</li>
<li>Communications;</li>
<li>Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring;</li>
<li>Quality Assurance;</li>
<li>Management of Change Process; and</li>
<li>Legal Requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s1_2">1.2 Audit Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of the audit included relevant sections of the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR) for safety and environmental protection as they apply to the Project during the pre-construction phase. The audit did not include TMPU’s Security Management Program as it will be reviewed by the Board through other, more appropriate, planned compliance verification activities.</p>
<h3 id="s1_3">1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
<p>The Board assessed whether TMPU’s documentation, processes and activities complied with the legal and other requirements under the Board’s authority listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The National Energy Board Act;</li>
<li>The Onshore Pipeline Regulations;</li>
<li>Any Conditions contained within applicable Certificates or Orders issued by the Board; and Requirements of any applicable NEB Safety Advisories.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s2">2.0 Project Overview</h2>
<p>TMPU, an affiliate of KMC, submitted a facilities application to the Board in December 2013. The application included the construction of a pipeline from a terminal in Edmonton, Alberta to terminals in Burnaby, Sumas and Westridge in British Columbia as shown in the map below. The Project will involve the construction of approximately 980&nbsp;km of new pipeline and the reactivation of 193&nbsp;km of existing pipeline. Twelve new pump stations will be built along the route and nineteen new petroleum storage tanks will be built; 14 in Burnaby, 1 in Sumas and 4 in Edmonton. In addition, the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby will be expanded with three new berths.</p>
<p><img src="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2017/T260prcnstrctn/mg/fg01-eng.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Trans Mountain Pipelines ULC &ndash; Proposed Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project Configuration Map" class="img-responsive"></p>
<p>The Governor in Council approved the Project in November 2016. A Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and other authorizations allowing the Project to proceed were issued and became effective on 1&nbsp;December 2016. The Project is still subject to a number of Board Conditions being satisfied by TMPU prior to, during, and post-construction.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2 id="s3">3.0	Description of the Audited Processes and Activities</h2>
<h3 id="s3_1">3.1 General</h3>
<p>In this section of the audit report, the processes and activities the Board evaluated through document review and interviews will be discussed. The Board’s assessment of compliance of the processes and activities will follow in Section&nbsp;4.</p>
<h3 id="s3_2">3.2 Organizational Structure, Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The Project is managed by the Vice-President of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (VP TMEP) who reports directly to TMPU’s Accountable Officer (AO). The Project is divided into three sub-projects: pipeline construction; facilities construction; and lower mainland construction. Each sub-project is headed by a project director who reports to the VP TMEP.</p>
<p>The Project management team reporting directly to the VP TMEP includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Senior Director Project Affairs;</li>
<li>Environmental Manager;</li>
<li>Health and Safety Lead;</li>
<li>Security Lead;</li>
<li>Director of Engineering;</li>
<li>Controller;</li>
<li>Director Supply Chain Management; and</li>
<li>Chief Quality Assurance Lead.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of the audit all of the above positions were staffed with the exception of the Chief Quality Assurance Lead position.</p>
<p>The Board was advised that the Project would be retaining the services of a construction management and inspection contractor who would work under direction of TMEP staff to provide quality, safety and environmental oversight of general construction contractors ensuring that all contractors will follow the Trans Mountain approved execution plans. The general construction contractors are to be hired separately by TMPU and will be used to construct the pipeline and facilities. At the time of the audit, the final selection of a construction management and inspection contractor and the general construction contractors had not been completed.</p>
<p>TMPU stated that the development of the organizational structure for the construction management and inspection organization will be directed by Trans Mountain, in consultation with the construction management and inspection contractors and will include the determination of the required number and types of positions as well as the establishment of the roles, responsibilities and competencies for each position.</p>
<h3 id="s3_3">3.3 Integration with the TMPU Management System</h3>
<p>For existing pipeline operations, TMPU has developed an Integrated Safety Loss Management System (ISLMS) which is its management system as per the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;6.1. During the audit, the Board did not evaluate the entirety of the ISLMS as it was beyond the scope for this focused audit. Instead, the Board evaluated if KMC met the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.1(c), which states: A company shall establish, implement and maintain a management system that (c) applies to all the company’s activities involving the <strong>design, construction</strong>, {emphasis added)] operation, or abandonment of a pipeline and to the programs referred to in section&nbsp;55. TMPU indicated that it would be using certain components of the ISLMS on the Project, however, not all components would be used.</p>
<p>As stated in TMPU’s Major Projects Management Plan (MPMP) “The Major Projects Program, is one of the management programs within the ISLMS.” The MPMP document also states “KMC is committed to the development, implementation, and maintenance of an Integrated Safety and Loss Management System (ISLMS) that addresses all aspects of the pipeline lifecycle to protect the safety and security of people, the environment and KMC’s business assets.” The document goes on to say the following “The Major Projects Management Program is responsible for the technical development, design, construction, and commissioning of a portfolio of growth related pipeline projects, facilities projects, and integrated projects that include both pipelines and facilities.” The Board noted that this demonstrates how construction activities are to be integrated into the MPMP and as a result part of the TMPU management system.</p>
<p>The MPMP document states “(the Plan) is the governing document for the Major Projects Program. The Plan outlines the key components of the program and describes how the standards, procedures and practices that the program utilizes will be applied to comply with ISLMS requirements.” The MPMP document explains how a major project would interact with existing ISLMS standards, procedures, frameworks and programs. Some examples of these from the MPMP document would include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hazard and Risk Management;</li>
<li>Legal Requirements;</li>
<li>Goals, Objectives, Targets, and Performance Measures; and</li>
<li>Training, Competency and Evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of the audit TMPU stated that it intends to develop a Project Management Plan to incorporate management system elements into the Project. However this was not available for review at the time of the audit.</p>
<h3 id="s3_4">3.4 Competency, Training and Evaluation</h3>
<p>TMPU stated that it will be directly contracting the services of general construction contractors for the construction of the pipeline and facilities. Part of the general contractor competency evaluation process will be carried out using ISNetworld&reg;.</p>
<p>ISNetWorld&reg; is a contractor management company that manages the safety compliance for many oil &amp; gas companies globally. ISNetworld&reg; collects safety, procurement, quality and regulatory information from contractors and suppliers and verifies its accuracy and reports on its results. TMPU explained that the construction management and inspection contractor will play a role in evaluating the qualifications and competencies of the construction contractors’ personnel brought on to the Project.</p>
<p>A component of its ISLMS that the Project will be using is the Contractor Competency Assurance Plan (CCAP). The CCAP is an existing set of processes for verifying that contractors conducting work on behalf of TMPU are qualified and competent to perform their duties. The CCAP establishes the systems and requirements to ensure that contractors conducting their work “are qualified and perform their assigned tasks in a manner that is safe, ensures the security of the pipeline, and protects the environment”.</p>
<p>As part of the CCAP process, contractors will be required to provide documentation to support the qualification of their employees prior to the start of work in order to verify the qualifications and competencies listed in ISNetworld&reg;. The Project team will apply the CCAP to the roles and positions identified by the construction management and inspection contractor. The Board was advised during interviews that field verification checks will be carried out by a qualified Project representative to ensure the general construction contractors are demonstrating competent performance in the execution of their work.</p>
<p>As part of the CCAP, a Contractor Qualification Specification (CQS) will be developed by the construction management and inspection contractor for each inspector role for review and approval by the Project team. A CQS is a document that “describes the responsibilities associated with a specific role to be performed by a contractor and specifies the necessary training and qualifications associated with that role.” Competency requirements for the work to be performed by contractors and each role required to perform the work shall be established in CQSs, as required. The CCAP documentation indicated that CQSs will also be applied to any contractor roles deemed highly technical or where there is a high risk to safety, security or protection of the environment.</p>
<p>Contractor training, qualification and competency requirements will be managed separately for the Project. The CQSs for all construction contractor personnel shall consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task-specific training required by occupational health and safety regulations;</li>
<li>Requirements of the Canada (Oil and Gas) Midstream Training Qualifications including core and job-specific training as supplied by the contractor; and</li>
<li>The completion of the Project orientation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimum safety training and qualification requirements for Project personnel and contractors are outlined in the Trans Mountain Expansion Project Health and Safety Management Plan (Project HSMP). Company personnel and consultants will be trained under the KMC KEEP Canada Practice Training Implementation Plan. KMC KEEP was identified as an on-line learning management system that ensures workers have core and discipline-specific competencies. It requires workers to complete on-line courses that provide required training and evaluation for competency.</p>
<p>The Board was advised during interviews that the Project orientation training for employees, contractors and visitors will consist of 4 levels of training. The four levels of training, as outlined below, will build upon one another such that anyone who takes Level 3 training will have to complete the lower levels as well:</p>
<ol class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li><strong>Level&nbsp;0:</strong> Level&nbsp;0 training provides visitors with basic information on safety, security and environment;</li>
<li><strong>Level&nbsp;1:</strong> This level of training is intended for general labourers and will consist of 4&nbsp;hours of training to provide a general understanding of health, safety and environmental issues followed by a competency test;</li>
<li><strong>Level&nbsp;2</strong>: Level&nbsp;2 training is intended for foremen and managers and will consist of a 4-hour&nbsp;training session to provide a more detailed understanding of environmental issues followed by a competency test;</li>
<li><strong>Level&nbsp;3:</strong> This level of training is for inspectors and monitors and will consist of a half&nbsp;day of training with the focus to provide a more detailed understanding of environmental issues, followed by a competency test.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of the training was available for review at the time of the audit.</p>
<h3 id="s3_5">3.5 Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control</h3>
<p>The Project management team advised the Board during interviews that it intends to issue the construction contractors with a basic inventory of hazards, risk assessments and controls. TMPU provided their Unified Hazard Listing and Risk Register for their operational facilities to the Board as part of the audit documentation.</p>
<p>Review indicated that, while it does contain some construction related hazards, it was not specific to the Project. TMPU staff indicated that it will be requiring its construction contractors to review, update and amend the list based on site specific conditions for their respective construction spreads. The site-specific hazard analyses, completed by each construction contractor are to be submitted to the Project management team for review and approval. The Project management team stated that following submission and approval it will create a unified list of hazards and potential hazards for the entire project.</p>
<p>TMPU had developed a Project specific Risk Register; however, it was developed a high level for Project development with risks such as weather related construction delays and delays in mainline pipe being shipped to the work sites. The Register was not developed in a manner that would allow for application to the management of workers at the various construction sites.</p>
<p>At the time of the audit, TMPU was unable to demonstrate that it had established a hazard inventory or implemented a process for analyzing hazards for the construction Project.</p>
<h3 id="s3_6">3.6 Communications</h3>
<p>The Project management team advised the Board during interviews that it intends to develop a Project Construction Internal Communication Plan based on the ISLMS Internal Communication Standard. The Board was also advised that construction communication plans for communicating between the Project team and its contractors are currently under development, and were not available at the time of the audit.</p>
<p>The Board was provided with a draft copy of the Project’s Stakeholder Engagement and Communications (SE&amp;C) Construction Execution Plan for communicating with external stakeholders. The plan addresses the engagement and communication strategies and activities required for the construction and operation of the Project. As indicated in the draft SE&amp;C Construction Execution Plan, the aim is “To ensure communications and engagement opportunities are appropriately tailored to the needs and interests of local communities, engagement activities have been divided into pipeline corridor communities (those potentially affected directly by the proposed pipeline and related facilities) and marine corridor communities (those potentially affected by the incremental increase in project-related marine vessel traffic).”</p>
<p>Some of the objectives of the plan were:</p>
<ul>
<li>“identify all areas of work to be undertaken by the SE&amp;C team in the lead up to and during construction;</li>
<li>identify roles and responsibilities, including those of contractors, support project teams to their respective construction execution plans, and</li>
<li>identify and complete all regulatory requirements.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board was advised during interviews with TMPU personnel that TMPU intends to establish a process to communicate all special conditions associated with the Project. This includes all special safety practices and procedures as required by the NEB Conditions to inform the contractors of their responsibilities. This training had not been developed at the time of the audit.</p>
<p>The Board was advised during interviews with TMPU personnel that Requests for Proposals (RFPs) used in the selection and hiring of contractors will be used to relay important information to the contractors to make them aware of special conditions associated with the Project. However, the Board was unable to verify through a review of the Project Procurement Execution Plan and the Project RFP &amp; Contracts Award Procedure that RFPs will be used to communicate important information such as company commitments or Board Conditions to contractors.</p>
<h3 id="s3_7">3.7 Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring</h3>
<p>TMPU has prepared and provided for review a compliance management plan (CMP) that presents a framework to achieve compliance as required by the Board’s approval Conditions. Construction contractors will be required to prepare Contractor Compliance Management Plans (CCMPs) with detailed site-specific processes and procedures to execute the Project’s specifications, documents and work plans. The CCMPs are to demonstrate compliance with legal and other requirements applicable to the Project including approval Conditions and commitments. The CCMPs are to be reviewed and approved by the Project management team.</p>
<p>Section&nbsp;2 of the CMP describes how the Project management team will track its commitments and compliance to all Board Conditions, environmental plans, ancillary permits and approvals. The CMP calls for the creation of a monitoring plan. The Project management team advised the Board during interviews and the Board verified through document review that the development of the monitoring plan will be the responsibility of the construction management and inspection contractor, once hired. The construction management and inspection contractor will be required to identify inspection and monitoring requirements, create a monitoring plan including organizational requirements and submit it to the Project management team for review and approval.</p>
<h3 id="s3_8">3.8 Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>The establishment and implementation of the QMP was one of the Project’s Board approval Conditions being assessed through parallel compliance verification activities. The status of the QMP condition compliance assessment can be reviewed on the NEB’s public website through the use of the <a href="/pplctnflng/mjrpp/trnsmntnxpnsn/cndtnstl-eng.html">Trans Mountain Interactive Conditions Tool</a><sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this audit, the Board reviewed the quality assurance program for the perspective of the project implementation stage and the organizational structure. At the time of the audit the Board noted that the Chief Quality Assurance Lead position was not staffed.</p>
<p>While the Project does have a QMP, with no one staffed in the Lead position, the Board was unsure how all aspects of the plan were being implemented at this late stage in the pre-construction process. At the time of the audit, TMPU has pre-approved a number of vendors and material suppliers; signed a contract for the purchase of piping and plate material; and has acquired several gate valves for one portion of the Project.</p>
<p>Through interviews and documentation review, the Board identified that TMPU did provide quality assurance oversight in the purchase of several gate valves. They did this by having a third party engineering consultant to witness and document vendor equipment tests on the valves. Additionally, through interviews and documentation review, the Board identified that TMPU had retained the services of a third party engineering consultant to evaluate pipe manufacturing facilities and pipe coating facilities as an early stage pre-construction activity. TMPU had also sent a representative to the pipe manufacturing and pipe coating facilities to review site safety conditions.</p>
<h3 id="s3_9">3.9 Health and Safety Management Plan</h3>
<p>The Board reviewed the Project HSMP which is to be used by the construction contractors to develop their own Project Specific Safety Plan (PSSP). The Board reviewed TMPU guidance notes and proposed outline for the PSSP manual. Once the services of the general construction contractors have been retained, each contractor is to develop a PSSP and submit it to the Project management team for review and approval. However, this had not yet been completed when the audit took place. The Board found the Project HSMP to be ready for contractor development of their PSSP. The establishment and implementation of the HSMP was one of the Project’s Board Conditions being assessed through parallel compliance verification activities. The status of the HSMP condition compliance assessment can be reviewed on the NEB’s public website through the use of the <a href="/pplctnflng/mjrpp/trnsmntnxpnsn/cndtnstl-eng.html">Trans Mountain Interactive Conditions Tool</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s3_10">3.10 Environmental Protection Plan</h3>
<p>The Board reviewed the environmental protection plan (EPP) for each project sub-component including mainline pipe, facilities and terminals. Each EPP provides a number of mitigation measures to be used by the Project management team, contractors, and sub-contractors for all stages and aspects of the Project construction. The establishment and implementation of the EPPs was one of the Project’s Board Conditions being assessed through parallel compliance verification activities. The status of the EPP Condition compliance assessment can be reviewed on the NEB’s public website through the use of the <a href="/pplctnflng/mjrpp/trnsmntnxpnsn/cndtnstl-eng.html">Trans Mountain Interactive Conditions Tool</a><sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="s3_11">3.11 Emergency Response Plan</h3>
<p>At the time of the audit, the Project management team provided the Board with a draft of the Project Construction Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for review. The Board verified through document review and during interviews with TMPU personnel that each construction contractor will be required to prepare their own Site-specific ERP (SSERP) and submit it to the Project management team for review and approval.</p>
<p>Through a review of the draft ERP, the Board determined it will be up to each construction contractor to ensure third party emergency responders within their construction spread are made aware of the work that is occurring, the associated hazards and site-specific emergency response procedures.</p>
<p>The submission of the ERP is one of the Board’s approval Conditions for the Project. According to the Project specific Condition, the ERP was due to be filed with the Board two&nbsp;months prior to the start of construction as part of Condition compliance. The Board reviewed the ERP from the perspective of this audit only, not for Condition compliance reasons. As this part of the audit process was completed very close to the Condition being filed, the Board is of the view that it addressed the requirements of the audit. The status of the Condition compliance assessment of the ERP can be reviewed on the NEB’s public website through the use of the <a href="/pplctnflng/mjrpp/trnsmntnxpnsn/cndtnstl-eng.html">Trans Mountain Interactive Conditions Tool</a><sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="s3_12">3.12 Record Management</h3>
<p>The Board verified through document review that records are to be kept in accordance with the requirements of the MPMP, which states: “Records associated with the Major Projects Program are subject to the requirements of KM Records and Information Governance Policy and managed in accordance with the ILSMS Records Management Standard.”</p>
<h3 id="s3_13">3.13 Management of Change (MOC)</h3>
<p>TMPU provided the Board with two MOC processes during the audit: one for TMPU’s existing pipeline operations (Ops) and one specifically for the Project. The TMPU Ops MOC process covers all operational changes to pipelines and facilities. The Project MOC process is to be used for certain aspects of the Project.</p>
<p>According to the Project MOC document, “the procedure shall be followed for any change to any aspect of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. The MOC process applies irrespective of whether KMC, the Contractors, or subcontractors initiate the change, though the MOC process will be initiated and approved by KMC. Every change causing variation in cost, schedule or regulatory approval process will be controlled through this MOC process. The intent of the MOC process is to ensure input and consistent communication to the respective groups of changes that impact the Project.”</p>
<p>The OPR MOC requirements do not include variations in cost or schedule. However the OPR requirements do include an MOC that can manage changes during construction such as design changes, regulatory changes, and procedural changes. The Board found this was not consistent with the requirements of the OPR as a company must have a single process applicable to the entire facility life cycle, not multiple processes.</p>
<h3 id="s3_14">3.14 Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>A list of legal requirements as defined by the ISLMS Legal Requirements Standard is maintained by KMC Regulatory Services Team in a legal registry. The Board reviewed KMC’s list of legal and other requirements and found it included much of the required content such as Conditions from Board Orders, Conditions specific to the Project approval, and Safety Advisories applicable to the Project. However review of the list indicated that the list did not include all referenced standards specifically included in the OPR.</p>

<h2 id="s4">4.0	Assessment of Compliance of the Audited Processes and Activities</h2>
<h3 id="s4_1">4.1 General</h3>
<p>In this section of the audit report the Board’s assessment of compliance of the processes and activities reviewed as part of the audit will be made. To determine compliance, the Board evaluated TMPU’s documents and records and conducted interviews with the Project personnel on issues relevant to the audit scope and criteria. The objective of the audit was to review and evaluate the state of establishment of processes and activities for the Project.</p>
<p>The audit did not intend to test implementation of the various processes, programs, procedures and activities of the Project as it was still in the pre-construction stage at the time of the audit. Also, given that the audit only evaluated the establishment of pre-construction activities and processes (and not operational activities and processes), the definition of ‘Established’ in the attached list of Terminology and Definitions (<a href="#nnxiii">Appendix&nbsp;3</a>) provides further guidance.</p>
<p>There are three possible assessments which were made as part of this pre-construction audit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compliant (see attached list of definitions);</li>
<li>Not-compliant (see attached list of definitions); and</li>
<li>Not Assessed</li>
</ul>
<p>Audit Protocol (AP) questions were assigned a numbering system from AP-TMPU-01 to AP-TMPU-37.</p>
<p>The Board identified a number of regulatory requirements that could not be assessed as either compliant or non-compliant during the audit. This was due to the fact that the Project had not yet progressed to the point where these protocol elements were required. The Board will be following up on all non-compliant and unable to assess protocol items through additional compliance verification activities outside of this audit.</p>
<p>There was also one protocol item that the Board did not assess in this audit and it will be the subject of a separate planned verification activity to be conducted by the Board.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="s4_3">4.3 Assessed as Non-Compliant</h3>
<p>The Board identified 15&nbsp;non-compliant (NC) findings during the audit. For a more detailed assessment, refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 as per the reference that follows each item.</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;1:</strong> While the Project is using components of the TMPU management system, it was unable to demonstrate to the Board how the Project has been fully integrated into the their management system in a manner that meets the requirements of OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.1 (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap01">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-01</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;2:</strong> TMPU’s policy for the internal reporting of hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses does not meet the requirements of the OPR. TMPU’s policy states that “immunity from disciplinary action is granted for persons who in good faith internally report hazards, potential hazards, accidents and near misses” The issue of concern is the term “good faith”, which is not explicit as required by the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.3(1)(a) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap02">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-0</a>2);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;3:</strong> TMPU has not created an organizational structure for the Project which meets the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.4. In accordance with TMPU’s MPMP Section&nbsp;7.1.6, “the project specific organizational structure and roles and responsibilities are to be established within a Project Execution Plan (PEP) or functional area sub-plan”, neither of which were available at the time of the audit. (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap03">Protocol Items AP-TMPU-03</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;4:</strong> TMPU provided their operational hazard inventory which has some construction related hazards, but it is not specific to the Project. TMPU has not yet developed a process to identify and analyze all hazards and potential hazards related to the Project in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(c) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap12">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-12</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;5:</strong> TMPU provided their operational hazard inventory which has some construction related hazards, but it is not specific to the Project. TMPU has not developed an inventory of the hazards and potential hazards related to the Project in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(d) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap13">Protocol Item AP-TMPU-13</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;6:</strong> The Project management team requires the construction contractors to provide specific construction spread hazard inventories to the Project team, and the construction contractors were not selected at the time of the audit. The Project did have a high level Risk Register associated with the overall Project development, but it was not granular enough to show the individual risks associated with the construction activities. The risks associated with 
the identified hazards and potential hazards specific to the Project were not complete in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(e) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap14">Protocol Item 
AP-TMPU-14</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;7:</strong> The Project management team requires the construction contractors to provide specific construction spread hazard inventories to the Project team. However the construction contractors had not been selected at the time of the audit. TMPU did demonstrate that they had controls for their operational level hazard inventory, however it was not specific to the construction related activities for the Project. Therefore, the Project Management team have not yet developed and implemented controls associated with the identified hazards and potential hazards related to the Project in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(f) 
(Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap17">Protocol Item AP-TMPU-17</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;8:</strong> TMPU provided the Board with two distinct MOC processes. One is used for existing and ongoing operational activities and one specifically for the Project. OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(i) indicates that a company shall have a single process, not multiple processes. Critical and important communication are to be communicated utilizing the Project MOC Process, however, the Project MOC process did not identify procedures for managing critical and important communications in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(m) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap22">Protocol Items AP-TMPU-22</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;9:</strong> TMPU has not yet developed a process to communicate all special Conditions associated with the Project; all special safety practices and procedures necessitated by the NEB Conditions specific to the construction; and inform the contractor of the contractor’s responsibilities in a manner which meets the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(l) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap26">Protocol Item AP-TMPU-26</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;10:</strong> TMPU has not yet developed an inspection and monitoring plan for the Project. In accordance with the requirements of MPMP and the CMP, each project is to develop a monitoring plan. Pre-construction work, which may involve physical activities, is still taking place on the Project regardless of whether or not a construction management and inspection contractor is in place. However, as of the date of the audit, TMPU had not yet established one in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(u) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap30">Protocol Items AP-TMPU-30</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;11:</strong> TMPU has not yet developed a process to ensure issues of concern found during monitoring activities are properly addressed in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(u) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap31">Protocol Items AP-TMPU-31</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;12:</strong> TMPU has not yet developed a process for handling deficiencies found during monitoring activities that require immediate attention in accordance with the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(u) (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap32">Protocol Items AP-TMPU-32</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;13:</strong> Through various activities, TMPU demonstrated that it had provided quality assurance for the purchase of several valve gates for the Project. TMPU also demonstrated that they had conducted quality assurance activities on potential pipe and coating suppliers. However, TMPU was found to be non-compliant for not following its own Quality Management Plan as per the requirements of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;15. During the audit, the Board noted that the pipe manufacturing companies and the vendors to supply the raw material (plate material) shown in the Pipe Purchase Agreement are not listed in the Project’s Approved Manufacturer’s List. At this stage of the pre-construction, to not have the Lead of Quality Management position staffed is in the Board’s view a concern as to how the overall Quality Management Program is fulfilling its responsibilities to the Project.</p>
<p>In addition, the audit team noted that TMPU’s Statement of Work for Vendor Quality Surveillance Services indicates that TMPU “will not assume any responsibility for the conformance of the work to codes and regulations.” The Board notes that the OPR’s quality assurance requirements are clear in that it is the regulated company’s responsibility to establish and implement the quality assurance program, not a third party vendor. Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap34">Protocol Items AP-TMPU-34</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;14:</strong> TMPU provided two distinct MOC process, while the OPR requires a company to have one MOC process that applies to all aspects of the facility lifecycle. The Board could not determine how the Project specific MOC process and the operational MOC process will interact for changes that affect both TMPU ongoing operational activities and the Project itself. In addition, the Project MOC process does not describe how to manage any risk not specified by the process as presented including any new risk. (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap35">Protocol Item AP-TMPU-35</a>);</p>
<p><strong>NC Finding&nbsp;15:</strong> TMPU was found to be non-compliant for not having a legal list that included all referenced standards specifically included in the OPR. (Refer to Appendix&nbsp;1 <a href="#ap36">Protocol Item&nbsp;AP-TMPU-36</a>).</p>
<h3 id="s4_4">4.4 Not Assessed</h3>
<p>The following protocol item was not assessed because it will be evaluated through a separate planned compliance verification activity outside of the audit:</p>
<p><strong>AP-TMPU-19:</strong> Has the company established a security management program that anticipates, prevents, manages and mitigates conditions that could adversely affect people, property or the environment?</p>
<p>There were a number of other protocol items which were annotated as not assessed due to the fact that the Project had not yet progressed to the point where these protocol elements were required. The Board will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of these items through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its on-going regulatory mandate.</p>

<h2 id="s5">5.0	Conclusion</h2>
<p>In consideration of the findings of non-compliance, the Board concludes that, at the time of the audit, TMPU had not yet established all of the necessary oversight measures to manage construction-related safety and environmental protection for the construction Project.</p>
<p>The Board noted that several processes, programs and activities were not fully established at the time of the audit. In several instances this resulted in the Board finding that TMPU was not in compliance with the requirements of the OPR. The Board found that there were non-compliances in the areas listed below, amongst others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality Assurance Program;</li>
<li>Hazard analyses;</li>
<li>Organizational structure and corresponding competency and training requirements;</li>
<li>Definition of inspection and monitoring requirements;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board identified that TMPU was not following all aspects of its quality management plan. For example, at the time of the audit, TMPU had not yet staffed its Senior Quality Assurance Lead position, which is a requirement of the quality management plan. While the Board noted that TMPU had been undertaking quality assurance activities on key aspects of its facility components purchased or ordered to date, the Board is of the view that the staffing of the Senior Quality Assurance Lead position is key to consistent safety and environmental management and should have been staffed at this time in the Project.</p>
<p>At the time of the audit, TMPU had not yet identified and analyzed all potential hazards related to the construction project or developed the necessary controls. While TMPU did provide its operational hazard inventory, and the associated controls, these are not specific to the Project, and may not be include all applicable hazards. The Board is of the view that this is an important step to ensure the safety of workers and the public and the protection of the environment. Following a management system approach, this step would lead to the development of other Project specific requirements such as determining the appropriate training and competencies of the workforce and the requirements of the monitoring and inspection program.</p>
<p>At the time of the audit, TMPU did not have a fully established organizational structure for the management and oversight of the Project with all corresponding competencies identified and training requirements developed. The Board noted that some aspects of the Project organizational structure had been established with their competencies and roles and responsibilities identified for TMPU staff. However, the construction management and inspection contractor had not been hired. The Board identified this contractor as one of the key methods of Project oversight and control for the Project. With the construction start date proposed for September of 2017, the Board will require a well-developed Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to demonstrate that this key level of Project oversight and control is well established and effective in its role.</p>
<p>As the inspection and monitoring plan for the Project is to be developed by the construction management and inspection contractor, who had not been hired at the time of the audit, this plan was not yet fully developed. The Board will require a well-developed CAP to demonstrate that this management system requirement has been addressed and it has been effectively implemented by the Project.</p>
<p>Throughout the audit, the Board noted that TMPU had not integrated the Project into TMPU’s overall management system in accordance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;6 of the OPR. The OPR explicitly requires a company to have a management system that “applies to all the company’s activities involving the <strong>design, construction</strong>, operation or abandonment of a pipeline and to the programs referred to in section&nbsp;55”(emphasis added). The Board did not see evidence to demonstrate that TMPU had integrated this Project into their existing management system. The Board did see that the Project was using pieces of TMPU’s management system in an ad hoc approach.</p>
<p>In consideration of the findings of non-compliance, the Board directs TMPU to rectify all non-compliances associated with planned construction activities. All non-compliances must be rectified in accordance with a corrective action plan that will ensure the safety of workers and the public and environmental protection for all subsequent construction activities.</p>

<h2 id="s6">6.0 Corrective Action Plan Submission</h2>
<p>The Board acknowledges that TMPU has submitted a proposed CAP. The Board has reviewed and approved this CAP, with guidance and direction as noted in the covering letter of this audit report. TMPU is required to implement its CAP in accordance with the methods and timelines described in the CAP at Appendix&nbsp;VII of this report. The Board will review the deliverables as outlined by TMPU’s CAP submission during implementation assessment meetings planned for the period August&nbsp;28-30, 2017. Each finding will be considered resolved when all of the deficiencies as described in the report have been addressed in accordance with the legal requirements, the commitments and the actions described in the CAP. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of TMPU’s management system and construction activities through targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.</p>
<p>The Board will post this Final Audit Report and the approved CAP on its website.</p>

<td><p>Can the company demonstrate they have integrated the pipeline construction project’s safety and environmental protection considerations into their management system?</p></td>
<td><p>NC</p></td>
<td><p>According to the Integrated Safety and Lost Management System, dated October 2016, “The Vice President, Trans Mountain Expansion Project is responsible for the implementation of the ISLMS within the Trans Mountain Expansion Project.” As stated in TMPU’s Major Projects Management Plan (MPMP) “The Major Projects Program, is one of the management programs within the ISLMS.” The Board noted that the MPMP document is dated 15&nbsp;May 2017.</p>
<p>The MPMP document states “KMC is committed to the development, implementation, and maintenance of an Integrated Safety and Loss Management System (ISLMS) that addresses all aspects of the pipeline lifecycle to protect the safety and security of people, the environment and KMC’s business assets.” The document goes on to say the following “The Major Projects Management Program is responsible for the technical development, design, construction, and commissioning of a portfolio of growth related pipeline projects, facilities projects, and integrated projects that include both pipelines and facilities.”</p>
<p>The Board noted that this demonstrates how construction activities are to be integrated into the MPMP and as a result part of the TMPU management system.</p>
<p>The MPMP document states “(the Plan) is the governing document for the Major Projects Program. The Plan outlines the key components of the program and describes how the standards, procedures and practices that the program utilizes will be applied to comply with ISLMS requirements.” The MPMP document explains how a major project would interact with existing ISLMS standards, procedures, frameworks and programs. Some examples of these from the MPMP document would include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hazard and Risk Management;</li>
<li>Legal Requirements;</li>
<li>Goals, Objectives, Targets, and Performance Measures; and</li>
<li>Training, Competency and Evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board was informed during interviews that TMPU Intends to develop a Project Management Plan to incorporate management system elements into the Project. However this was not available at the time of the audit.</p>
<p>While the Project is using pieces of the TMPU management system, such as the ISLMS Legal Requirements Standard, TMPU was unable to demonstrate to the Board how the Project has been fully integrated into the their management system in a manner that meets the requirements of OPR.</p>
<p>Based on the scope of the audit, the Board found TMPU to be non-compliant with the requirement of the OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.1(a) and (b) at the time of the audit.</p></td>

<p>However, this policy does not meet the requirements of the OPR. The KMC policy states that “immunity from disciplinary action is granted for persons who in <strong>good faith</strong> internally report hazards, potential hazards, accidents and near misses”.

<p>The Board was advised during interviews that the RFPs associated with retaining the services of contractors will be another method used to relay information to the contractors to make them aware of special conditions associated with the Project. Specific requirements that the potential contractors will be responsible for are explained in the RFP documents so contractors are aware of what they will be required to do if they win the contract.</p>
<p>The Board reviewed the Project Procurement Execution Plan and the Project RFP &amp; Contracts Award Procedure. The Board found that while the two documents indicated that bidding packages would be assembled for contractors to bid on, TMPU was unable to demonstrate that special conditions are communicated to potential contractors in these documents.

<td><p>The Board noted that the TMPU draft Project specific Emergency Response Manual describes how emergency response procedures will be communicated to third party emergency responders and the TMPU Operations Team. It also describes how the construction contractors are to communicate their ERPs to adjacent contractors and advise them whenever there are changes.</p>
<p>The draft ERP defines the minimum requirements which must be met by contractors in the development of site-specific ERPs (SSERPs), which are to be submitted to the Project management team for review and approval. The draft document details the division of responsibility between TMPU and contractors for various types of emergencies.</p>
<p>The draft ERP requires contractors to ensure local authorities and other contractors working adjacent are provided with the SSERP.</p>
<p>“Local Emergency Response authorities are to be engaged prior to the start of work to ensure effective coordination and communication with local fire, health and ambulance personnel and resources.”</p>
<p>“Contractors are expected, prior to the start of work, to meet with relevant, local (Municipal, Regional, District, Provincial) Emergency Response Authorities. Information from these authorities, including procedures and communications protocols in the event of an emergency, must be considered in the Contractor’s development of their SSERP.”</p>
<p>“Work maps will be made available to local emergency responders as required during a review of their SSERP with local first responders and health care officials.”</p>
<p>The document requires contractors to communicate any changes to their SSERPs to other contractors and sub-contractors on their scope of the Project.</p>
<p>According to the Project specific Condition, the ERP was due to be filed with the Board 2&nbsp;months prior to the start of construction as part of Condition compliance. The Board reviewed the ERP from the perspective of this audit only, not for condition compliance reasons.

<p>The operational MOC process covers all operational changes to pipelines and facilities. As stated in the Project specific MOC document the “procedure shall be followed for any change to any aspect of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (the Project).</p>
<p>The MOC process applies irrespective of whether KMC, the Contractors, or subcontractors initiate the change, though the MOC process will be initiated and approved by KMC. Every change causing variation in cost, schedule, or regulatory approval process will be controlled through this MOC process.” The OPR MOC requirements do not include variations in cost or schedule. However the OPR requirements do include an MOC that can manage changes during construction such as design changes, regulatory changes, and procedural changes. The Project specific MOC does not meet this requirement.</p>
<p>The Board could not determine how the Project specific MOC process and the operational MOC process will interact for changes that affect both TMPU ongoing operational activities and the Project itself.

<h2 id="nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II: Audit Process Overview</h2>
<h3>NEB Purpose and Audit Framework</h3>
<p>The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security, environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that ensures: the safety and security of the public and the company’s employees; safety of the pipeline and property; and protection of the environment, the Board has developed regulations requiring companies to establish and implement documented management systems applicable to specified technical management and protection programs. These management systems and programs must take into consideration all applicable requirements of the NEB Act and its associated regulations. The applicable Legislation and Regulations which come under the NEB’s mandate, responsibilities and powers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Energy Board Act and associated regulations;</li>
<li>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act and associated regulations;</li>
<li>Canada Petroleum Resources Act (sections&nbsp;28 and 35) and associated regulations;</li>
<li>Oil and Gas Operations Act and associated regulations; and</li>
<li>Petroleum Resources Act and associated regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional regulatory requirements are contained within:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Canada Labour Code, Part&nbsp;II, and the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations; and</li>
<li>Any conditions contained within applicable certificates or orders issued by the Board.</li>
</ul>
<p>To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits the management system and programs of regulated companies. The Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks. The Board’s management system requirements are described within the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR) sections&nbsp;6.1 through&nbsp;6.6.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The NEB expects pipeline companies to operate in a systematic, comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board expects companies to have effective, fully developed and implemented management systems and protection programs that provide for continual improvement.</p>
<p>As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and maintain effective management systems and protection programs in order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions that may adversely affect the safety and security of the company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as the protection of property and the environment.</p>
<p>During the audit, the Board reviews documentation and samples records provided by the company in its demonstration of compliance and interviews corporate and regionally based staff. The Board also conducts separate but linked technical inspections of a representative sample of company facilities. This enables the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness and implementation of the management system and programs. The Board bases the scope and location of the inspections on the needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an inspection, they are actioned as set out by the Board’s standard inspection and enforcement practices.</p>
<p>After completing its field activities, the Board develops and issues a Final Audit Report. The Final Audit Report outlines the Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations of the company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports are published on the Board’s website. The audit results are integrated into NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.</p>
<h3>Audit Objectives and Scope</h3>
<p>This audit evaluated the company against the legal requirements and scope outlined in the main body of the audit report.</p>
<h3>Audit Activities</h3>
<p>On 12&nbsp;April 2017, the Board informed Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC of its intent to audit the Trans Mountain Expansion Project from a pre-construction point of view. Board staff then provided TMPU with an overview of the NEB audit process, the audit criteria, a request for documentation and a list of questions to answer relevant to the objectives and scope of the audit. The NEB conducted its assessment based on the responses provided by the company and the evidence gathered during the audit.</p>
<p>Board staff was in contact with company staff on a regular basis to arrange and coordinate this audit. TMPU established a digital access portal for Board staff to review documentation and records.</p>
<p>On 16&nbsp;May 2017, Board Staff conducted an opening meeting with company representatives in Calgary to confirm the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. Subsequent to the opening meeting, interviews were held at the company’s office in Calgary during the period 29&nbsp;May to 2&nbsp;June 2017. Throughout the audit, Board audit staff provided company representatives with daily summaries with action items, where required.</p>
<p>On 9&nbsp;June 2017, the Board held an audit pre close-out meeting with company representatives. At this meeting, Board staff and TMPU staff discussed potential non-compliances identified during the audit. At that time the company was provided with the opportunity to present additional evidence to rectify these potential non-compliances.</p>
<p>On 14&nbsp;June 2017, the Board held a final close-out meeting with company representatives to present the Board’s final assessment of findings noted during the audit.</p>

<h2 id="nnxiii">Appendix&nbsp;III: Terminology and Definitions</h2>
<p>(The Board has applied the following definitions and explanations in measuring the various requirements included in this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or guidance and practices established by the Board, where available.)</p>
<p><strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB&nbsp;Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated through documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to determine whether specified activities, events, conditions management systems or information about these matters conform to audit criteria and legal requirements and communicating the results of the process to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Compliant:</strong> The company has demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> A plan that addresses the non-compliances identified in the audit report and explains the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.</p>
<p><strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has been created in the format required and meets the described regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes. Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation, quality assurance, audit and management review processes as outlined in the OPR.</p>
<p><strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has been developed in the format required. It has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews have provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are not partially utilized).</p>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>List:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has been kept current in the format required and continues to meet regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5(1)(o). With records, the company must demonstrate that it meets the records management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)(p).</p>
<p><strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR sections&nbsp;6.1 to 6.6. It is a systematic approach designed to effectively manage hazards and reduce risk, and promote continual improvement. The system includes the organizational structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations related to safety, security and environmental protection.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
<p>As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set out in OPR sections&nbsp;6.1 to 6.6. Therefore, in evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers more than the specific requirements of section&nbsp;6.1. It considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6.&nbsp;4; and considers the establishment, implementation, development and/or maintenance of the processes, inventory and list described in section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1(c) and (d), the company’s management system and processes must apply and be applied to the programs described in section 55.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> The company has not demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must be developed and implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps followed in a regular and defined order thereby allowing individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities required for completing each step.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that take place in an established order and are directed toward a specific result. A process also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A process may contain a set of procedures, if required.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management system processes applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
<p>OPR section 6.5(1) describes the Board’s required management system processes. In evaluating a company’s management system processes, the Board considers whether each process or requirement: has been established, implemented, developed or maintained as described within each section; whether the process is documented; and whether the process is designed to address the requirements of the process, for example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common 5 w’s and h approach (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR section. Processes must incorporate or contain linkage to procedures, where required to meet the process requirements.</p>
<p>As the processes constitute part of the management system, the required processes must be developed in a manner that allows them to function as part of the system. The required management system is described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the company following its policies and goals established and required by section&nbsp;6.3.</p>
<p>Further, OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) indicates that each process must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the programs referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which considers the specific technical requirements associated with each program and is applied to and meets the process requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that single process may not meet all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as long as they meet the process requirements (as described above) and direct the program processes to be established and implemented in a consistent manner that allows for the management system to function as described in 6.1.</p>
<p><strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the program is achieving the intended results.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB regulations.)</p>
<p>The program must include details on the activities to be completed including what, by whom, when, and how. The program must also include the resources required to complete the activities.</p>

<p>During the CAP review, the NEB will review the deliverables as outlined by TMPU’s CAP submission. Each finding will be considered resolved when all of the deficiencies as described in the report have been addressed in accordance with the legal requirements, the commitments and the actions described in the CAP. Meetings to discuss CAPs will be organized if required.</p>
<p>The Lead Auditor will liaise with TMPU’s representative whom we have copied on this letter to arrange the document review for the CAP. If you require any further information or clarification during the review, please contact Mark Tinney Lead Auditor, at 403-966-1065.</p>

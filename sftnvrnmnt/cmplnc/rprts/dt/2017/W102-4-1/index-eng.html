<h3 id="smmr">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management systems into their day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>This report documents the Board’s audit of the above ground monitoring and surveillance activities (collectively referred to as patrol activities) of Spectra Energy Transmission. Specifically, this audit focussed on the adequacy and effectiveness of the patrol activities for its NEB-regulated pipeline facilities that are part of sub-element&nbsp;4.1 <strong>Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring</strong> of the National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol published in July 2013. Given the scope of this audit, it also included the requirements contained within the Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies (DPR-O) and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA&nbsp;Z662-15).</p>
<p>The Board conducted the audit using the audit protocols detailed in Appendices&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II. <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> focused solely on sub-element&nbsp;4.1 Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring, whereas <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> evaluated how the company’s patrol activities interacted with the other elements of the Spectra Energy Transmission’s management system; specifically as they relate to the inputs and outputs and linkages between the other management system elements.</p>
<p>The Board’s audit of Spectra Energy Transmission’s federally regulated facilities found that Spectra Energy Transmission demonstrated that it conducts various types of patrol activities to identify hazards on its rights of way, particularly relating to the identification and management of potential unauthorized third party activity. As patrol activities are expected to identify several types of hazards along the rights of way, the audit found that Spectra Energy Transmission’s practices regarding several aspects of its patrols did not meet the Board’s requirements. A detailed assessment of the patrol activities documented in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this audit report.</p>
<p>The Board also assessed the extent to which Spectra Energy Transmission’s management system processes were integrated with its patrol activities. The Board also evaluated whether Spectra Energy Transmission could demonstrate an established link to its patrol activities where required. The details of this assessment are outlined in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> of this audit report.</p>
<p>Spectra Energy Transmission was able to demonstrate that most of the governance sub-elements had been integrated with the patrol activities. The Board also noted that Spectra Energy Transmission was conducting several types of patrols. Interviews and document review confirmed that Spectra Energy Transmission’s patrol activities were being conducted in order to identify and prevent unauthorized activities.</p>
<p>During its evaluation, the Board noted deficiencies regarding the execution and evaluation identified on patrol activities. The details of this assessment are outlined in Appendix&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II of this audit report. The three Non-Compliant findings are:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Spectra Energy Transmission was unable to produce documented evidence that all their ground and aerial inspection patrols conform to the specific conditions and activities required by CAN/CSA&nbsp;Z662-15.</li>
<li>While Spectra Energy Transmission has demonstrated it has developed process and system requirements for majority of its patrols the board has determined that additional process and requirements need to be established and implemented for ground patrols.</li>
<li>Spectra Energy Transmission could not demonstrate that it has conducted any audits that included Patrols to determine whether its patrol activities are adequate or effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued, Spectra Energy Transmission must develop and submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for Board approval. The CAP must detail how Spectra Energy Transmission intends to resolve the non-compliances and deficiencies identified by this audit. The Board will verify that the corrective actions are completed in a timely manner and applied consistently across Spectra Energy Transmission’s system. The Board will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of Spectra Energy Transmission’s management system and programs through targeted compliance verification activities as part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.</p>

<h2 id="s1">1.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
<p>The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security, environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure and markets in the Canadian public interest, within the mandate set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade. In order to meet this the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR),  requires pipeline companies to operate in a systematic, comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks with effective, fully developed and implemented management systems and protection programs that provide for continual improvement. A carefully-designed and well-implemented management system supports a strong culture of safety, and is fundamental to keeping people safe and protecting the environment. To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits the management system and programs of regulated companies. The Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.</p>
<p>This audit is one in a series of focused audits that the Board is conducting of company right of way (ROW) patrol activities and is focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.1 <strong>Inspection, Measuring and Monitoring</strong> of the National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol published in July 2013.</p>
<p>The Board developed its audit protocols to evaluate Spectra Energy Transmission’s patrol activities and to verify that they are appropriately implemented and managed. To this end, the Board conducted interviews with corporate and regionally-based staff; field inspections and reviewed documentation and records related to patrol activities. This enabled the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness and implementation of the patrol program. The Board based the scope and location of the field inspections on the needs of the audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard inspection processes and practices. Although they inform the audit, inspections are considered independent of the audit. If unsafe or non-compliant activities are identified during an inspection, they are actioned as set out by the Board’s standard inspection and enforcement practices.</p>
<p>After completing its field activities, the Board developed and issued a Draft Audit Report (this document). The Draft Audit Report outlines the Board’s audit activities and provides evaluations of the company’s compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit Report, the company must submit and implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all non-compliances identified. Final Audit Reports are published on the Board’s website. The audit results are integrated into the NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle approach to compliance assurance.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2 id="s2">2.0 Background</h2>
<p>The Board selected companies for the audits of patrol activities based on the NEB risk model. This model combines the inherent risks of the pipeline system with the companies’ performance in other compliance areas. Westcoast Energy Inc., carrying on business as Spectra Energy Transmission, owns the Westcoast Transmission System (Westcoast). Westcoast extends from points in Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Alberta and BC, to the Canada-U.S. border near Huntingdon, BC. At the border Westcoast connects to Williams Northwest Pipeline, which supplies natural gas to the U.S. Pacific Northwest. More information on the federally regulated system is available in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> of this audit report.</p>
<p>This audit is focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.1 <strong>Inspection, Measuring and Monitoring</strong> of the National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol published in July 2013.</p>
<p>The Board developed its audit protocols to evaluate Spectra Energy Transmission’s patrol activities and to verify that they are appropriately managed. To this end, the Board conducted interviews, inspections and reviewed documentation and records related to patrol activities.</p>

<h2 id="s3">3.0 Audit Objectives and Scope</h2>
<p>The objective of the audit was to evaluate Spectra Energy Transmission’s performance against the applicable requirements specifically as they relate to patrol activities. The scope of the audit focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.1 of the Board’s audit protocol to verify that patrol activities are adequately identifying issues noted on the rights-of way to promote environmental protection, pipeline integrity, emergency response, security and damage prevention. The Board also examined the degree to which patrol activities were integrated with the company’s management system to ensure the protection of the environment and the safety and security of the public.</p>
<p>This audit was based on the requirement that federally regulated pipeline companies are required to conduct patrols of their rights of way to actively monitor any potential hazards that could jeopardize the safety of people and the environment. The information gathered and issues observed by patrol activities must be communicated to the appropriate protection programs for tracking and resolution. Equally important, in an established management system, some of the hazards identified by the protection programs areas of the company’s management system must inform the patrol activities to promote effective monitoring of these hazards.</p>
<p>For this audit, Spectra Energy Transmission was audited against the requirements contained within the following legal requirements as they relate to patrol activities:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>The National Energy Board Act;</li>
<li>The National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations;</li>
<li>The Damage Prevention Regulations;</li>
<li>Canadian Standards Association (CSA)&nbsp;Z662 &ndash; 15 &ndash; Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems; and</li>

<h2 id="s4">4.0 Audit Process, Methodology and Activities</h2>
<p>The Board informed Spectra Energy Transmission of its intent to audit its NEB regulated facilities in a letter dated 9&nbsp;August 2016. Following the issuance of this letter, Board audit staff met with Spectra Energy Transmission to arrange and coordinate this audit. The Board also provided Spectra Energy Transmission with an information request guidance document as well as discussion questions to help Spectra Energy Transmission prepare for the audit, and provide access to documentation and records to demonstrate its compliance. Spectra Energy Transmission established a digital access portal for Board staff to review documentation and records.</p>
<p>On 7&nbsp;September 2016, an opening meeting was conducted with representatives from Spectra Energy Transmission in Calgary, Alberta to confirm the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. The opening meeting was followed by various field level audit activities as described in the table below. Throughout the audit, Board audit staff gave Spectra Energy Transmission daily summaries which included requests for additional documentation and interviews.</p>
<p>On 11&nbsp;November 2016, the Board sent a pre-closeout information request to Spectra Energy Transmission. At this meeting Board staff and Spectra Energy Transmission staff discussed potential deficiencies identified during field activities and discussed additional information that could be of value to the Board prior to compiling its draft audit report. An audit close-out meeting was held on 15&nbsp;November 2016 to provide Spectra Energy Transmission with a description of the recommendations that staff would be bringing to the Board for decision.</p>

<h2 id="s5">5.0 Summary of Audit Findings</h2>
<p>In order for the patrol activities to be assessed for compliance to the requirements as well as their role in the company’s protection programs, the activities were audited using two complimentary protocols. <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> is divided in five sections, with each section covering a partial component of the Board’s expectations for sub-element&nbsp;4.1.</p>
<p>In <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>, the Board’s Audit Protocol identifies five Management System elements which are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub&nbsp;elements. Each sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. As this audit is focused on patrol activities and related inputs and outputs from other protection programs, many of the processes required by the OPR were considered within the scope of this audit. If a company’s program is found to be deficient with respect to any regulatory requirement as it relates to pipeline patrols, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) will be required in order to demonstrate to the Board that appropriate actions will be taken to address the deficiency.</p>
<p>The following summary represents an overview of the Board’s audit findings for Spectra Energy Transmission’s patrol activities based on information provided for the audit.</p>
<h3>Appendix&nbsp;I</h3>
<p>In <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>, Spectra Energy Transmission’s patrol activities were audited against the relevant legal requirements to answer the question:</p>
<p>Does the company conduct its patrol activities in accordance with all applicable legal requirements?</p>
<p>Through a review of inspection reports, the Board confirmed that patrol reports were being generated after each patrol. A review of a sample of aerial patrol reports identified that these reports did not include confirmation that each of the CSA-Z662-15 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1 conditions and activities were being monitored or assessed during patrols.</p>
<p>This type of reporting by exception does not allow for any monitoring of developing trends that can affect the safety and operation of the pipeline nor does it document an assessment of the various potential issues.</p>
<p>The full assessment is available in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report.</p>
<h3>Appendix&nbsp;II</h3>
<p>With <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> , Spectra Energy Transmission’s patrol activities were audited and evaluated against the processes, procedures and standards that it identifies as being part of its management system and protection programs.</p>
<p>The <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> protocol focuses on the following question:</p>
<p>Can the company demonstrate that the patrol activities and the resulting inputs and outputs are linked to the management system processes required by the OPR?</p>
<p>The audit found that Spectra Energy Transmission has integrated its patrol activities into the majority of the management system sub-elements</p>
<p>The Non-Compliant findings described in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> were due to:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Spectra Energy Transmission relies on workers to continually monitor ROW during their daily activities (Ad Hoc patrols) this monitoring is not documented in an Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) or written into job requirements and through interviews and record review the auditors noted inconsistent monitoring practices</li>
<li>Spectra Energy Transmission could not demonstrate that it has conducted any audits that included Patrols to determine whether its patrol activities are adequate or effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full assessment is available in Appendix&nbsp;II of this report.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2 id="s6">6.0 Conclusions</h2>
<p>Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation must establish and implement effective management systems in their day-to-day operations. The Board has determined that although Spectra Energy Transmission is conducting patrol activities, 3 findings were noted in 3&nbsp;sub-elements of its management system that have not been consistently implemented with its patrol activities.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the final report, Spectra Energy Transmission must develop a corrective action plan describing its proposed methods to resolve the non-compliances identified in Appendices&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II and the timeline in which corrective actions will be completed. Spectra Energy Transmission is required to submit its corrective action plan for Board approval within 30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report being issued. The Board will make its final Audit Report and Spectra Energy Transmission’s approved corrective action plan public on the Board’s website.</p>
<p>The Board will assess the implementation of Spectra Energy Transmission’s corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall implementation and effectiveness of Spectra Energy Transmission’s patrol activities.</p>

<h2 id="s7">7.0 Audit Terminology and Definitions</h2>
<p>(The Board has applied the following definitions and explanations in measuring the various requirements included in this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or guidance and practices established by the Board, where available.)</p>
<p><strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated through documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to determine whether specified activities, events, conditions management systems or information about these matters conform to audit criteria and legal requirements, and communicating the results of the process to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> Addresses the non-compliances identified in the audit report, and explains the methods and actions that will be used to correct them.</p>
<p><strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has been created in the format required and meets the described regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes. Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation, quality assurance, audit and management review processes as outlined in the OPR.</p>
<p><strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has been developed in the format required. It has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how to use the process or other requirement. The company has demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented, meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process requirements and its application. Staff have been trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews have provided evidence of full implementation of the requirement, as prescribed (i.e. the process or procedures are not partially utilized).</p>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>List:</strong> A documented compilation of required items. It must be kept in a manner that allows it to be integrated into the management system and management system processes without further definition or analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has been kept current in the format required and continues to meet regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(o). With records, the company must demonstrate that it meets the records management requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(p).</p>
<p><strong>Management System:</strong> The system set out in OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. It is a systematic approach designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote continual improvement. The system includes the organizational structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and procedures required for the organization to meet its obligations related to safety, security and environmental protection.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
<p>As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set out in OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in evaluating a company’s management system, the Board considers more than the specific requirements of Section&nbsp;6.1. It considers how well the company has developed, incorporated and implemented the policies and goals on which it must base its management system as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its organizational structure as described in section&nbsp;6. 4; and considers the establishment, implementation, development and/or maintenance of the processes, inventory and list described in section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;(c) and&nbsp;(d), the company’s management system and processes must apply and be applied to the programs described in section&nbsp;55.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must be developed and implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Practice:</strong> A repeated or customary action that is well understood by the persons authorized to carry it out.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps followed in a regular and defined order, thereby allowing individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities required for completing each step.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that take place in an established order and are directed toward a specific result. A process also outlines the roles, responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A process may contain a set of procedures, if required.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of management system processes applicable to its regulated facilities.)</p>
<p>OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.5(1) establishes the basic requirements for management system processes. In evaluating a company’s management system processes, the Board considers whether each process or requirement: has been established, implemented, developed or maintained as described within each section; whether the process is documented; and whether the process is designed to address the requirements of the process, for example a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The Board considers this to constitute a common 5&nbsp;w’s and h approach (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board recognizes that the OPR processes have multiple requirements; companies may therefore establish and implement multiple processes, as long as they are designed to meet the legal requirements and integrate any processes linkages contemplated by the OPR&nbsp;section. Processes may incorporate or contain linkage to procedures, where required to meet the process requirements.</p>
<p>As the processes constitute part of the management system, the required processes must be developed in a manner that allows them to function as part of the system. The system requirements are described in OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must be designed in a manner that contributes to the company following its policies and goals established and required by section&nbsp;6.3.</p>
<p>Further, OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;6.&nbsp;(1) indicates that each process must be part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the programs referred to in OPR section&nbsp;55. Therefore, to be compliant, the process must also be designed in a manner which considers the specific technical requirements associated with each program and is applied to and meets the process requirements within each program. The Board recognizes that a single process may not meet all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to establish governance processes as long as they meet the process requirements (as described above) and direct the program processes to be established and implemented in a consistent manner that allows for the management system to function as described in 6.1.</p>
<p><strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the program is achieving the intended results.</p>
<p>(The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB regulations.)</p>
<p>The program must include details on the activities to be completed including what, by whom, when, and how. The program must also include the resources required to complete the activities.</p>

<h5>NEB Assessment</h5>
<p><a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>'s focus is solely on the various types of patrol activities conducted pursuant to the legal requirements. An evaluation of the patrol activities in the context of the management system and the process requirements outline in 4.1 is provided in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> of this report.</p>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-0">1.0 Inspecting and Monitoring</h4>
<p>The Board expects companies to have an established, implemented and effective process for inspecting and monitoring the company’s activities and facilities to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the protection programs. In order to verify the implementation of the ROW monitoring activities, the NEB conducted several ROW inspections in urban and rural settings in support of the audit both by air and ground patrol.</p>
<p>Given the scope of this audit, these processes and protection programs were not reviewed for compliance or adequacy. Rather, the Board conducted a focused audit of the company’s pipeline patrol activities which is typically part of the surveillance and monitoring program. Patrol activities are one method used by companies to monitor the effectiveness of the protection programs. The review in this appendix relates directly to the patrol activities that Spectra Energy Transmission had in place at the time of the audit.</p>
<p>Westcoast Energy Inc., carrying on business as Spectra Energy Transmission, owns the Westcoast Transmission System (Westcoast). Westcoast extends from points in the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Alberta and BC, to the Canada-U.S. border near Huntingdon, BC. At the border Westcoast connects to Williams Northwest Pipeline, which supplies natural gas to the U.S. Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Spectra Energy Transmission provided standard operating practices 7.1 Lands Pipeline Right-of-Way Patrol and 7.4 Geotechnical Patrol, Environmental program and Integrity management program documents that describe the process, frequency, responsibilities, competencies, emergency procedures and reporting requirements of the Patrols.</p>
<p><strong>These activities are described as follows:</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li><strong>Aerial Patrol:</strong><br>
Spectra Energy Transmission conducts routine aerial patrols of its ROW by helicopter. The remote northern gathering lines are patrolled annually and the transmission lines are patrolled monthly. The aerial Patrol is conducted by a Spectra Energy Transmission employee and/or a Pembina Pipelines representative in the Central region where Pembina and Spectra Energy Transmission share a ROW patrol bi monthly. These inspections are documented on the aerial patrols report. Employees are present as observers in all regions.</li>
<li><strong>Geotechnical/ Hydrotechnical Patrol:</strong><br>
Spectra Energy Transmission conducts annual Geotechnical/ Hydrotechnical Patrol aerial patrols as part of their integrity management program. The frequency of these patrols is based on the western Canadian climatic cycle where increased hydrotechnical and geotechnical activity occurs during the annual spring freshet typically from March to June (depending on the specific watercourse catchment basin and local/regional climate). Geotechnical patrols are scheduled annually to precede spring freshet between July and November. Patrols are documented in excel workbooks, one for each of the 8 operating areas.</li>
<li><strong>Supplemental Pipeline Right-of-Way Aerial Patrol and/or Field Reviews:</strong><br>
In the event of abnormal weather conditions such as a high precipitation event and/or an extreme freshet flood, supplemental pipeline right-of-way patrols may perform as described in the Geohazard Management Plan.</li>
<li><strong>Ad Hoc Patrol:</strong><br>
During their normal daily operations activities Spectra Energy Transmission employees check on the ROW they are working on or traveling past, these checks can include checking fenced facilities for signs of tampering and vandalism. These checks are documented on email if an issue is noted and entered into the work management system for resolution. The auditors reviewed emails presented as evidence.<br>
Note: These types of patrols are not scheduled nor are there any written process or requirement documents. This is noted as non-compliance in <a href="#nnxii">appendix&nbsp;II</a> under operational conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental :</strong><br>
Spectra Energy Transmission conducts several types of environmental inspections within its environmental management progra<strong>Inspections</strong>m. These activities include:
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Facility site inspections: related to routine activities, focused on one or more operational areas within a facility</li>
<li>Pipeline site inspections: focused on the transmission and gathering lines and their ancillary operations</li>
<li>Follow-up inspections: review of previous inspections to verify the implementation of corrective actions</li>
<li>Turnaround inspections: performed during turnaround activities at plants/facilities</li>
<li>Permit and approval inspections: site specific inspections which main goal to ensure compliance to the approval and/or permits</li>
<li>Project/ Construction Inspections: inspections related to projects and/or construction projects</li>
</ul>
These inspections are documented and the results are filed on a central network drive.</li>
<li><strong>Cathodic protection survey:</strong><br>
 While the scope of this audit is limited to patrol activities, the Board notes that Spectra Energy Transmission has scheduled other activities in order to monitor its cathodic protection; it has retained contractors to undertake an annual corrosion survey.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetation management survey:</strong><br>
 While the scope of this audit is limited to patrol activities, the Board notes that Spectra Energy Transmission has scheduled other activities in order to monitor its vegetation management; it has retained contractors to undertake an annual vegetation survey.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the Board did not find any issues of non-compliance for this aspect of the requirement.</p>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-0">2.0 Evaluating adequacy and taking corrective action</h4>
<p>The Board requires companies to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the protection programs and for taking corrective and preventive actions if deficiencies are identified. During the audit, the Board reviewed records of various types of patrol activities as part of its surveillance and monitoring program.</p>
<p>In cases where issues were noted on the reports, the Board noted that Spectra Energy Transmission demonstrated that potential unauthorized activities, Integrity, environmental and operational issues Spectra Energy Transmission had a processes for reporting, tracking, communicating and resolving these issues using data bases for collecting the information and software systems for tracking the issues to closure.</p>
<p>Interviews, document and record review determined that Spectra Energy Transmission is evaluating the effectiveness of its right of way patrol activities during quarterly management reviews and consistently tracking any issues to resolution.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the Board did not find any issues of non-compliance for this aspect of the requirement.</p>

<h3 class="mrgn-tp-0">1.1 Right of Way Patrols</h3>
<p><strong>Regulatory Requirements</strong></p>
<p>DPR-O s.&nbsp;16(b): The damage prevention program that a pipeline company is required to develop, implement and maintain under section&nbsp;47.2 of the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations must include ongoing monitoring of any changes in the use of the land on which a pipeline is located and the land that is adjacent to that land.</p>
<p>CSA&nbsp;Z662-15, Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1, Pipeline patrolling:<br>
Operating companies shall periodically patrol their pipelines in order to observe conditions and activities on and adjacent to their rights-of-way that can affect the safety and operation of the pipelines. Particular attention shall be given to the following:</p>
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
<li>construction activity;</li>
<li>dredging operations;</li>
<li>erosion;</li>
<li>ice effects;</li>
<li>scour;</li>
<li>seismic activity;</li>
<li>soil slides;</li>
<li>subsidence;</li>
<li>loss of cover;</li>
<li>evidence of leaks; and</li>
<li>unauthorized activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>CSA&nbsp;Z662-15, Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2:<br>
The frequency of pipeline patrolling shall be determined by considering such factors as</p>
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
<li>operating pressure;</li>
<li>pipeline size;</li>
<li>population density;</li>
<li>service fluid;</li>
<li>terrain;</li>
<li>weather; and</li>
<li>agricultural and other land use.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h5>NEB Assessment</h5>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-0">Monitoring of adjacent lands (DPR-O)</h4>
<p>The National Energy Board Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies (DPR-O) requirements came into effect on 19 June 2016. The DPR-O requires that companies develop a Damage Prevention Program which includes ongoing monitoring of any changes in the use of the land on which a pipeline is located and the land that is adjacent to that land.</p>
Spectra Energy Transmission did demonstrate that it has revised its patrol activities to account for the additional requirements outlined in the DPR-O&nbsp;s.16&nbsp;(b). As part of its demonstration Spectra provided its class location management plan, SOP&nbsp;7.2 Class Location Assessment and demonstrated through there GIS system that captures and documents changes in land use are according to the DPR requirements.
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the Board did not find any issues of non-compliance for this aspect of the requirement.</p>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-0">Observing conditions and activities (CSA&nbsp;clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1)</h4>
<p>Spectra Energy Transmission’s SOP Lands Pipeline Right-of-Way Patrol includes the list of CSA-Z662-15 conditions to pay attention to during patrols. Through a review of inspection reports, the Board confirmed that patrol reports were being generated after each patrol. A review of a sample of aerial patrol reports identified that these reports did not include confirmation that each of the CSA-Z662-15 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1 conditions and activities were being monitored or assessed during patrols.</p>
<p>This type of reporting by exception does not allow for any monitoring of developing trends that can affect the safety and operation of the pipeline nor does it document an assessment of the various potential issues.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Due to the fact that the aerial patrols report by exception, that is, only noted when activity or an issue is present, Spectra Energy Transmission could not demonstrate that it is monitoring all the issues as noted in CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1.</p>
<p>Therefore, the audit determined that Spectra Energy Transmission is non-compliant with this requirement. The Board requires that a CAP be developed to address this non-compliance.</p>
<h4 class="mrgn-tp-0">Frequency of inspections (CSA&nbsp;clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2)</h4>
<p>Spectra Energy Transmission provided documentation related to its patrol activities and ROW maintenance standards. Spectra Energy Transmission’s Pipeline standards, management plans and standard operating procedures (SOPs) describe frequency of patrols and any triggers that would require increasing or changing patrol frequencies.</p>
<p>Documents included :</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Class location management plan</li>
<li>Pipeline Systems Integrity Management Plan</li>
<li>Geohazard Management Plan Page</li>
<li>SOP&nbsp;7.1 section&nbsp;3.0 Patrol Frequency</li>
<li>Process Safety Management System</li>
</ul>
<p>Spectra Energy Transmission was able to demonstrate that it has provided criteria for establishing its frequency of patrols. As it included all of the factors as listed in CSA&nbsp;Z662-15, Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2 requirements in the documents.</p>
<h5>Conclusion </h5>
<p>Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the Board did not find any issues of non-compliance for this aspect of the requirement.</p>

<h5>NEB Assessment:</h5>
<p>The Spectra Energy Transmission Integrity, Environment and Lands &amp; Damage prevention Departments are responsible for the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for patrols and the patrol schedule. The Lands and Damage Prevention Department are responsible for the aerial patrols SOP. The frequency of Lands Patrols is determined by population density, urban development, foreign construction activity, etc. in the area of the pipeline ROW. Areas with higher third party activity are patrolled monthly or every other month.</p>
<p>All findings are recorded on a “Pipeline ROW Inspection Report”. Reports are distributed as per the “ROW Inspection Distribution List” noted as an appendix in the SOP&nbsp;7.1. In the event of a non-emergency situation that requires immediate attention, Team Leaders and appropriate Spectra Energy Transmission support staff, are notified as soon as possible and provided with details of the situation. The area Operations Team Leader will provide information to the area Planner/Scheduler so that a notification can be created in the Spectra Energy Transmission Work Management System to initiate and track the corrective actions identified during inspections.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> the Spectra Energy Transmission relies on workers to continually monitor ROW during their daily activities (Ad Hoc patrols) this monitoring is not documented in an SOP or written into job requirements and through interviews and record review the auditors noted inconsistent monitoring practices.</p>
<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
<p>While Spectra Energy Transmission has demonstrated it has developed process and system requirements for majority of its patrols the board has determined that additional process and requirements need to be established and implemented for these (Ad Hoc patrols).

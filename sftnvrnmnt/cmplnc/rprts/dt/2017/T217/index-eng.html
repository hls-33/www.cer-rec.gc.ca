              <p>Dear Mr.&nbsp;Ferris:</p>
              <p class="text-center">
                <strong
                  >National Energy Board’s (Board or NEB) Final Audit Report<br />
                  Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc. (Trans-Northern)</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                On 14&nbsp;July 2016, the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) informed Trans-Northern of its intent to audit
                Trans-Northern’s NEB regulated facilities. The audit focused on
                the patrol activities conducted as required by
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <strong>Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring</strong>, of the
                NEB Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol.
                Throughout this audit, the Board evaluated patrol activities in
                the context of the protection programs and the management
                system.
              </p>
              <p><strong> Summary of the Audit</strong></p>
              <p>
                In its review, the Board verified that Trans-Northern undertakes
                several types of aerial and ground patrol activities to identify
                hazards and potential hazards on its rights of way (ROW). The
                Board determined that Trans-Northern could demonstrate that some
                aspects of its management system including the goals and targets
                and policy were linked to its patrol activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following points summarize gaps which are reflected in the
                Non-Compliant findings made by the Board in its audit of
                Trans-Northern’s patrol activities:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  management system processes such as training, communication
                  and document management were not fully implemented with
                  regards to patrol activities;
                </li>
                <li>
                  environmental and integrity issues identified by patrol were
                  not consistently reported, communicated and effectively
                  tracked to resolution;
                </li>
                <li>
                  oversight procedures to review and assess patrol activities in
                  order to verify ongoing  suitability, adequacy and
                  effectiveness of the activities and those staff and
                  contractors responsible for them were not fully implemented;
                </li>
                <li>
                  resolution of past corrective actions related to patrols was
                  not timely in some  situations; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  procedures related to patrol activities were not consistently
                  developed and implemented in accordance with all legal
                  requirements.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As outlined in the regulations, the Board holds Senior
                Management accountable for ensuring continual improvement in
                meeting the company’s obligations to perform its activities in a
                manner that ensures the safety and security of the public,
                company employees, the pipeline, and protection of property and
                the environment. Accordingly, Senior Management is accountable
                to provide the direction for the programs and activities and
                establish the focus for continual improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                On or before 20&nbsp;February 2017, Trans-Northern is required
                to file a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) with the Board for
                approval. The CAP shall describe the methods and timing for
                addressing the non-compliances identified in this final Audit
                Report. Once approved, the Board will make the CAP public and
                will continue to monitor and assess all of Trans-Northern’s
                corrective actions with respect to this audit until they are
                fully implemented.

              <p>
                Companies regulated by the National Energy Board (NEB or the
                Board) must demonstrate a proactive commitment to continual
                improvement in safety, security and environmental protection.
                Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are required to
                incorporate adequate, effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s audit of the above ground
                monitoring and surveillance activities (collectively referred to
                as patrol activities) of Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc.
                (Trans-Northern). Specifically, this audit focussed on the
                adequacy and effectiveness of the patrol activities for
                Trans-Northern’s NEB-regulated pipeline facilities. The audit
                focussed on sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <strong>Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring</strong> of the
                National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program
                Audit Protocol published in July 2013. Given the scope of this
                audit, it also included the requirements contained within the
                Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline
                Companies (DPR&ndash;O) and the Canadian Standards Association
                (CSA&nbsp;Z662-15).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board conducted the audit using the audit protocols detailed
                in Appendices&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II.
                <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> focused solely on
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1 Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring,
                whereas <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> evaluated how the
                company’s patrol activities interacted with the other elements
                of the Trans-Northern’s management system; specifically as they
                relate to the inputs and outputs and linkages between the other
                management system elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit of Trans-Northern’s federally regulated
                facilities found that Trans-Northern demonstrated that it
                conducts various types of patrol activities to identify hazards
                on its rights of way, particularly relating to the
                identification and management of potential unauthorized third
                party activity. As patrol activities are expected to identify
                several types of hazards along the rights of way, the audit
                found that Trans-Northern’s practices regarding several aspects
                of its patrols did not meet the Board’s requirements. A detailed
                assessment of the patrol activities documented in
                <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also assessed the extent to which Trans-Northern’s
                management system processes were integrated with its patrol
                activities. The Board also evaluated whether Trans-Northern
                could demonstrate an established link to its patrol activities
                where required. The details of this assessment are outlined in
                <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> of this audit report.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trans-Northern was able to demonstrate that some of the
                governance sub-elements had been integrated with the patrol
                activities including its overarching Health and Safety policy,
                its Management of Change process and its development of goals
                and targets. The Board also noted that Trans-Northern was
                conducting several types of patrols. Interviews and document
                review confirmed that Trans-Northern’s patrol activities were
                being conducted in order to identify and prevent unauthorized
                activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                During its evaluation, the Board noted several deficiencies
                which impacted the planning, execution, evaluation and
                resolution of issues identified by patrol activities. As the
                resolution of issues on the ROW is paramount to the safety of
                people and the environment, the Board is of the view that
                addressing these deficiencies within the patrol activities will
                contribute to improve safety. The majority of the Non-Compliant
                findings fell into these categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  failure to demonstrate that its patrol activities are being
                  conducted in accordance with all of the legal requirements;
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued,
                Trans-Northern must develop and submit a Corrective Action Plan
                (CAP) for Board approval. The CAP must outline how
                Trans-Northern intends to resolve the non-compliances identified
                by this audit. In its CAP, Trans-Northern must address the main
                issues described above as well as the management system
                deficiencies that contribute to those issues. In order for
                Trans-Northern to meet its regulatory obligations, it must
                demonstrate that its senior management is actively and formally
                directing the improvements to its system in general to improve
                to its patrols in particular. This active direction should
                result in the establishment of effective patrol activities that
                ensure the identification, communication and mitigation of
                hazards, the integration of legal requirements and include
                measuring its performance to promote continual improvement.

                The Board will verify that the corrective actions are completed
                in a timely manner and applied consistently across
                Trans-Northern’s system. The Board will continue to monitor the

              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade. In order to assure that pipelines are
                designed, constructed, operated and abandoned in a manner that
                ensures the safety and security of the public and the company’s
                employees; the safety of the pipeline and property; and
                protection of the environment, the Board expects pipeline
                companies to operate in a systematic, comprehensive and
                proactive manner that manages risks. As required by the National
                Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR), the Board
                expects that companies have effective, fully developed and
                implemented management systems and protection programs that
                provide for continual improvement. A carefully-designed and
                well-implemented management system supports a strong culture of
                safety, and is fundamental to keeping people safe and protecting
                the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the Board audits
                the management system and programs of regulated companies. The
                Board requires each regulated company to demonstrate that they
                have established and implemented, adequate and effective methods
                for proactively identifying and managing hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit is one in a series of focused audits that the Board
                is conducting of company right of way (ROW) patrol activities
                and is focused on sub-element&nbsp;4.1
                <strong>Inspection, Measuring and Monitoring</strong> of the
                National Energy Board Management System and Protection Program
                Audit Protocol published in July 2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board developed its audit protocols to evaluate
                Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc.’s (Trans-Northern) patrol
                activities and to verify that they are appropriately implemented
                and managed. To this end, the Board conducted interviews with
                corporate and regionally-based staff; field inspections and
                reviewed documentation and records related to patrol activities.
                This enabled the Board to evaluate the adequacy, effectiveness
                and implementation of the patrol program. The Board based the
                scope and location of the field inspections on the needs of the
                audit. The inspections follow the Board’s standard inspection
                processes and practices. Although they inform the audit,
                inspections are considered independent of the audit. If unsafe
                or non-compliant activities are identified during an inspection,
                they are actioned as set out by the Board’s standard inspection
                and enforcement practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing its field activities, the Board developed and
                issued a Draft Audit Report (this document). The Draft Audit
                Report outlines the Board’s audit activities and provides
                evaluations of the company’s compliance with the applicable
                regulatory requirements. Once the Board issues the Final Audit
                Report, the company must submit and implement a Corrective
                Action Plan to address all non-compliances identified. Final
                Audit Reports are published on the Board’s website. The audit
                results are integrated into the NEB’s risk-informed lifecycle
                approach to compliance assurance.

              <p>
                The Board is piloting a new approach to audits in the fiscal
                year&nbsp;2016/17. It identified the need to conduct a series of
                audits focused on company patrol activities. This decision was
                based on an internal analysis of compliance data and application
                of the NEB risk model. This model combines different aspects of
                the pipeline system’s location, product etc. with the companies’
                performance in other compliance areas. Trans-Northern Pipelines
                Inc. (Trans-Northern) was therefore selected to be audited based
                on its compliance history and relative risk presented by its
                pipeline system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trans-Northern is owned equally by Suncor Energy Inc., Shell
                Canada Limited and Imperial Oil Limited. It operates an
                approximately 850&nbsp;kilometre pipeline that supplies refined
                products (gasoline, jet fuel and fuel oil) from refineries in
                Ontario and Quebec to the Montreal and Toronto airports as well
                as major fuel outlets in the Ottawa area. More information on
                the federally regulated system is available in

              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to evaluate Trans-Northern’s
                performance against the applicable requirements specifically as
                they relate to patrol activities. The scope of the audit focused
                on sub-element&nbsp;4.1 of the Board’s audit protocol to verify
                that patrol activities are adequately identifying issues noted
                on the rights-of way to promote environmental protection,
                pipeline integrity, emergency response, security and damage
                prevention. The Board also examined the degree to which patrol
                activities were integrated with the company’s management system
                to ensure the protection of the environment and the safety and
                security of the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit was based on the requirement that federally regulated
                pipeline companies are required to conduct patrols of their
                rights of way to actively monitor hazards and potential hazards
                that could jeopardize the safety of people and the environment.
                The information gathered and issues observed by patrol
                activities must be communicated to the appropriate protection
                programs for tracking and resolution. Equally important, the
                hazards identified by the protection programs must inform the
                patrol activities to promote effective monitoring of these
                hazards.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this audit, Trans-Northern was audited against the
                requirements contained within the following legal requirements
                as they relate to patrol activities:

              <p>
                The Board informed Trans-Northern of its intention to audit its
                NEB regulated facilities in a letter dated 14&nbsp;July 2016.
                Following the issuance of this letter, Board audit staff met
                with Trans-Northern to arrange and coordinate this audit. The
                Board also provided Trans-Northern with an information request
                guidance document as well as discussion questions to help
                Trans-Northern prepare for the audit, and provide access to
                documentation and records to demonstrate its compliance.
                Trans-Northern established a digital access portal for Board
                staff to review documentation and records.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 26&nbsp;July 2016, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from Trans-Northern in Calgary, Alberta to
                confirm the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. The
                opening meeting was followed by various field level audit
                activities as described in the table below. Throughout the
                audit, Board audit staff gave Trans-Northern daily summaries
                which included requests for additional documentation and
                interviews.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 2&nbsp;September 2016, the Board sent a pre-closeout
                information request to Trans-Northern outlining potential
                deficiencies identified during field activities to request
                additional information prior to compiling its draft audit
                report. An audit close-out meeting was held on 21&nbsp;October
                2016 to provide Trans-Northern with a description of the
                recommendations that staff would be bringing to the Board for
                decision.

              <p>
                In order for the patrol activities to be assessed for compliance
                to the requirements as well as their role in the company’s
                protection programs, the activities were audited using two
                complimentary protocols. <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> is
                divided in five&nbsp;sections, with each section covering a
                partial component of the Board’s expectations for
                sub-element&nbsp;4.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                In <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>, the Board’s Audit
                Protocol identifies five&nbsp;Management System elements which
                are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each
                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. As
                this audit is focussed on patrol activities and related inputs
                and outputs from other protection programs, many of the
                processes required by the OPR were considered within the scope
                of this audit. If a company’s program is found to be deficient
                with respect to any regulatory requirement as it relates to
                pipeline patrols, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) will be
                required in order to demonstrate to the Board that appropriate
                actions will be taken to address the deficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following summary represents an overview of the Board’s
                audit findings for Trans-Northern’s patrol activities based on
                information provided for the audit.
              </p>
              <h3>Appendix&nbsp;I</h3>
              <p>
                In <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a>, Trans-Northern’s patrol
                activities were audited against the relevant legal requirements
                to answer the question:
              </p>
              <p>
                Does the company conduct its patrol activities in accordance
                with all applicable legal requirements?
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board was able to verify that Trans-Northern is conducting
                several types of ROW patrol activities for its NEB regulated
                facilities including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>daily ground patrols in the Greater Toronto Area;</li>
                <li>weekly aerial patrol of the entire system;</li>
                <li>
                  ground patrol conducted at a minimum of every 10&nbsp;days of
                  its 17&nbsp;elevated consequence areas; and
                </li>
                <li>an annual line walk of the entire system.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, the audit verified that Trans-Northern conducts
                focused inspections to monitor specific threats along its
                rights-of-way, which include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>an annual cathodic protection survey; and</li>
                <li>scour assessments for selected water crossings.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board also found that Trans-Northern has implemented
                processes particularly for the reporting of potential
                unauthorized activities noted during patrol activities as
                required by the DPR&ndash;O. The Non-Compliant findings
                described in Appendix&nbsp;I were attributed to a failure to
                ensure that Trans-Northern’s patrol activities are being
                conducted in accordance with all of the legal requirements. The
                full assessment is available in Appendix&nbsp;I of this report.
              </p>
              <h3>Appendix&nbsp;II</h3>
              <p>
                With <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> , Trans-Northern’s
                patrol activities were audited and evaluated against the
                processes, procedures and standards that it identifies as being
                part of its management system and protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> protocol focuses on
                the following question:
              </p>
              <p>
                Can the company demonstrate that the patrol activities and the
                resulting inputs and outputs are linked to the management system
                processes required by the OPR?
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit found that Trans-Northern has integrated its patrol
                activities into some of the management system sub-elements
                including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>the policy;</li>
                <li>the goals and targets;</li>
                <li>Management of Change; and</li>
                <li>
                  aspects of the sub-elements that relate to its Damage
                  Prevention Program.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, with the exception of the Damage Prevention Program,
                the Board found that the inputs and outputs from the patrol
                activities have not been consistently integrated into the
                management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Non-Compliant findings described in
                <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> were due to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  failure to demonstrate the consistent and formal
                  identification, documentation, communication and resolution of
                  issues identified by patrol activities;
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      further described in
                      <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> within
                      sub-elements:  2.1, 3.5, 3.6,4.4, 5.1; and
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  lack of evaluation of the patrol activities and the staff and
                  contractors conducting them  to ensure the ongoing
                  effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of these activities
                  and identify areas for improvement;
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      further described in
                      <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> within sub-elements:
                      3.4, 4.3, 5.1

              <h2 id="s6">6.0 Conclusions</h2>
              <p>
                Companies regulated by the NEB must demonstrate a proactive
                commitment to continual improvement in safety, security and
                environmental protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s
                regulation must establish and implement effective management
                systems in their day-to-day operations. In conducting this
                review, the Board has determined that although Trans-Northern is
                conducting patrol activities, there are several sub-elements of
                its management system that have not been consistently
                implemented with regards to its patrol activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon receipt of the final report, Trans-Northern must develop a
                corrective action plan describing its proposed methods to
                resolve the non-compliances identified in Appendices&nbsp;I and
                II and the timeline in which corrective actions will be
                completed. Trans-Northern is required to submit its corrective
                action plan for Board approval within 30&nbsp;days of the final
                Audit Report being issued. The Board will make its final Audit
                Report and Trans-Northern’s approved corrective action plan
                public on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of Trans-Northern’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of Trans-Northern’s patrol
                activities.

              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following definitions and
                explanations in measuring the various requirements included in
                this audit. They follow or incorporate legislated definitions or
                guidance and practices established by the Board, where
                available.)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Adequate:</strong> The management system, programs or
                processes complies with the scope, documentation requirements
                and, where applicable, the stated goals and outcomes of the NEB
                Act, its associated regulations and referenced standards. Within
                the Board’s regulatory requirements, this is demonstrated
                through documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, documented verification
                process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to
                determine whether specified activities, events, conditions
                management systems or information about these matters conform to
                audit criteria and legal requirements, and communicating the
                results of the process to the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> Addresses the
                non-compliances identified in the audit report, and explains the
                methods and actions that will be used to correct them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developed:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been created in the format required and meets the described
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Effective:</strong> A process or other requirement meets
                its stated goals, objectives, targets and regulated outcomes.
                Continual improvement is being demonstrated. Within the Board’s
                regulatory requirements, this is primarily demonstrated by
                records of inspection, measurement, monitoring, investigation,
                quality assurance, audit and management review processes as
                outlined in the OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Established:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been developed in the format required. It has been approved and
                endorsed for use by the appropriate management authority and
                communicated throughout the organization. All staff and persons
                working on behalf of the company or others that may require
                knowledge of the requirement are aware of the process
                requirements and its application. Staff has been trained on how
                to use the process or other requirement. The company has
                demonstrated that the process or other requirement has been
                implemented on a permanent basis. As a measure of “permanent
                basis”, the Board requires the requirement to be implemented,
                meeting all of the prescribed requirements, for three months.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                compliance of programs or elements in meeting the requirements
                of the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Implemented:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been approved and endorsed for use by the appropriate management
                authority. It has been communicated throughout the organization.
                All staff and persons working on behalf of the company or others
                that may require knowledge of the requirement are aware of the
                process requirements and its application. Staff have been
                trained on how to use the process or other requirement. Staff
                and others working on behalf of the company have demonstrated
                use of the process or other requirement. Records and interviews
                have provided evidence of full implementation of the
                requirement, as prescribed (i. e. the process or procedures are
                not partially utilized).

              <p>
                <strong>Maintained:</strong> A process or other requirement has
                been kept current in the format required and continues to meet
                regulatory requirements. With documents, the company must
                demonstrate that it meets the document management requirements
                in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(o). With records, the
                company must demonstrate that it meets the records management
                requirements in OPR, section&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(p).

                to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote continual
                improvement. The system includes the organizational structures,
                resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and procedures
                required for the organization to meet its obligations related to
                safety, security and environmental protection.

                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management systems applicable to
                its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, the NEB management system requirements are set
                out in OPR sections 6.1 to&nbsp;6.6. Therefore, in evaluating a
                company’s management system, the Board considers more than the
                specific requirements of Section&nbsp;6.1. It considers how well
                the company has developed, incorporated and implemented the
                policies and goals on which it must base its management system
                as described in section&nbsp;6.3; its organizational structure
                as described in section&nbsp;6.4; and considers the
                establishment, implementation, development and/or maintenance of
                the processes, inventory and list described in
                section&nbsp;6.5(1). As stated in sections&nbsp;6.1 (c) and (d),
                the company’s management system and processes must apply and be
                applied to the programs described in section 55.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action plan must
                be developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Practice:</strong> A repeated or customary action that
                is well understood by the persons authorized to carry it out.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order, thereby allowing
                individual activities to be completed in an effective and safe
                manner. A procedure also outlines the roles, responsibilities
                and authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> A documented series of actions that
                take place in an established order and are directed toward a
                specific result. A process also outlines the roles,
                responsibilities and authorities involved in the actions. A
                process may contain a set of procedures, if required.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of management system processes
                applicable to its regulated facilities.)
              </p>
              <p>
                OPR section&nbsp;6.5(1) establishes the basic requirements for
                management system processes. In evaluating a company’s
                management system processes, the Board considers whether each
                process or requirement: has been established, implemented,
                developed or maintained as described within each section;
                whether the process is documented; and whether the process is
                designed to address the requirements of the process, for example
                a process for identifying and analyzing all hazards and
                potential hazards. Processes must contain explicit required
                actions including roles, responsibilities and authorities for
                staff establishing, managing and implementing the processes. The
                Board considers this to constitute a common 5&nbsp;w’s and h
                approach (who, what, where, when, why and how). The Board
                recognizes that the OPR processes have multiple requirements;
                companies may therefore establish and implement multiple
                processes, as long as they are designed to meet the legal
                requirements and integrate any processes linkages contemplated
                by the OPR section. Processes may incorporate or contain linkage
                to procedures, where required to meet the process requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the processes constitute part of the management system, the
                required processes must be developed in a manner that allows
                them to function as part of the system. The system requirements
                are described in OPR section&nbsp;6.1. The processes must be
                designed in a manner that contributes to the company following
                its policies and goals established and required by
                section&nbsp;6.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, OPR section 6.5 (1) indicates that each process must be
                part of the management system <strong>and</strong> the programs
                referred to in OPR section 55. Therefore, to be compliant, the
                process must also be designed in a manner which considers the
                specific technical requirements associated with each program and
                is applied to and meets the process requirements within each
                program. The Board recognizes that a single process may not meet
                all of the programs; in these cases it is acceptable to
                establish governance processes as long as they meet the process
                requirements (as described above) and direct the program
                processes to be established and implemented in a consistent
                manner that allows for the management system to function as
                described in 6.1.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program
                outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked; in
                other words, how each one contributes to the result. A company
                regularly plans and evaluates its program to check that the
                program is achieving the intended results.
              </p>
              <p>
                (The Board has applied the following interpretation of the OPR
                for evaluating compliance of programs required by the NEB
                regulations.)
              </p>
              <p>
                The program must include details on the activities to be
                completed including what, by whom, when, and how. The program
                must also include the resources required to complete the
                activities.

                <p>
                  The Board expects companies to have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for inspecting and
                  monitoring the company’s activities and facilities to evaluate
                  the adequacy and effectiveness of the protection programs. In
                  order to verify the implementation of the right-of-way (ROW)
                  monitoring activities, the NEB attended a selection of aerial
                  and vehicle ROW patrols conducted in both urban and rural
                  settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given the scope of this audit, these processes and protection
                  programs were not reviewed for compliance or adequacy. Rather,
                  the Board conducted a focused audit of the company’s pipeline
                  patrol activities which is typically part of the surveillance
                  and monitoring program. Patrol activities are one method used
                  by companies to monitor the effectiveness of the protection
                  programs. The review in this appendix relates directly to the
                  patrol activities that Trans-Northern had in place at the time
                  of the audit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern’s NEB regulated facilities consist of
                  895&nbsp;kilometres of ROW in urban and rural areas of Ontario
                  and Quebec. According to its Trans-Northern’s Pipeline
                  Integrity Management Standard (PIMS), right of way
                  surveillance is one of the proactive measures Trans-Northern
                  has implemented to address the threat of mechanical damage. In
                  order to monitor its rights of way and conduct inspections to
                  monitor conditions on and near its facilities, Trans-Northern
                  has scheduled various types of pipeline patrols. These
                  activities are described as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Ground patrol:</strong> Trans-Northern conducts
                    daily vehicle ground patrol of the ROW in the Greater
                    Toronto Area. These patrols are conducted by a contractor
                    for the Joint Pipeline Group who have shared or adjacent
                    rights of way in urban Toronto where there is frequent third
                    party activity. These inspections include checking fenced
                    facilities for signs of tampering and vandalism.
                    Trans-Northern also conducts a daily patrol of the ROW in
                    Montreal-Nord. These inspections are planned and documented.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>10&nbsp;day  patrol:</strong> This vehicle patrol is
                    conducted at a minimum of every 10&nbsp;days of the 
                    17&nbsp;areas that have been designated as elevated
                    consequence areas (ECAs);
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Annual line walk:</strong> Trans-Northern conducts
                    an annual line walk from Nanticoke to Montreal including all
                    laterals. These patrols are typically conducted in the
                    Spring and Fall.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Aerial Patrol:</strong> Trans-Northern conducts
                    weekly aerial patrols of its ROW by fixed wing aircraft.
                    Until recently, aerial patrol was conducted by a pilot alone
                    who would be accountable for identifying and reporting
                    issues on the ROW. At the time of the audit, Trans-Northern
                    aerial patrol procedure was changing to add an observer on
                    every flight.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cathodic protection survey:</strong> While the scope
                    of this audit is limited to patrol activities, the Board
                    notes that Trans-Northern has scheduled other activities in
                    order to monitor its cathodic protection; it has retained
                    contractors to undertake an annual corrosion survey.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Water Crossings / Scour Assessments:</strong>
                    Assessments of river crossings for the effects of scour is
                    monitored through separate ROW monitoring activities.
                    According to the Trans-Northern Pipeline Integrity
                    Management Standard 2014, river crossings are to be
                    inspected on a five year frequency. Trans-Northern provided
                    its latest scour assessment for selected river crossings for
                    review. The report indicates that similar reports for other
                    river crossings in December 2014 and August 2015, the
                    criteria for selection of river was not provided for this
                    audit.

                <p>
                  Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the

                  1.2 Evaluating adequacy and taking corrective action
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The Board also requires companies to evaluate the adequacy and
                  effectiveness of the protection programs and for taking
                  corrective and preventive actions if deficiencies are
                  identified. During the audit, the Board reviewed records of
                  various types of patrol activities as part of its surveillance
                  and monitoring program. In cases where issues relating to
                  unauthorized activities were documented in the reports, the
                  Board noted that Trans-Northern demonstrated that it had a
                  process for reporting, tracking, communicating and resolving
                  these issues using a work order system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board also notes that Trans-Northern is identifying some
                  environmental and integrity issues such as pipeline exposures
                  or vegetation management in its patrol reports. However,
                  despite these issues being noted by patrols, Trans-Northern
                  could not demonstrate that it was consistently tracking these
                  issues to resolution through the work order system or
                  communicating them internally to ensure coordination between
                  the protection programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the number of types of patrol activities being
                  conducted, Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that it is
                  evaluating the effectiveness of these activities to verify
                  that they were adequate or effective. This issue is discussed
                  in subsequent sections of this report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board noted several issues with respect to pipeline
                  identification along its ROW. During its review of records,
                  the Board noted instances of signage deficiencies previously
                  noted by Trans-Northern which remained deficient years later.
                  In addition, during the inspections, the Board identified
                  several ROW markers that did not contain any cautionary
                  statement as required by CSA&nbsp;Z662-15
                  clause&nbsp;10.5.3.3.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These issues and the specific corrective actions required are
                  further examined in <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a>.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Trans-Northern is conducting several
                  types of ground and aerial patrol activities. The Board also
                  noted that the patrols identify issues of potential
                  unauthorized activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the Board found that Trans-Northern did not
                  demonstrate that it had a consistent process for taking
                  corrective action for all reported issues including any
                  environmental or integrity issues identified by patrol
                  activities. Therefore, the Board has determined that
                  Trans-Northern is in non-compliance with
                  OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(u) as it relates to pipeline patrol
                  activities. As a result, the Board requires that
                  Trans-Northern develop a CAP to address this non-compliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to ensure that the CAPs related to reporting and
                  tracking of issues noted by patrols are implemented across all
                  of the protection programs, the Board will verify that all
                  issues noted by the various types of ROW surveillance and
                  monitoring (including cathodic protection, and scour
                  assessments) are being tracked and managed to resolution
                  during the CAP review period.

                  The National Energy Board Damage Prevention Regulations
                  &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies (DPR&ndash;O)
                  requirements came into effect on 19 June 2016. The DPR&ndash;O
                  requires that companies develop a Damage Prevention Program
                  which includes ongoing monitoring of any changes in the use of
                  the land on which a pipeline is located and the land that is
                  adjacent to that land. At the time of the audit,
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that it has revised its
                  patrol activities to account for the additional requirements
                  outlined in the DPR&ndash;O&nbsp;s.16(b).

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern’s Right of Way Maintenance and Surveillance
                  Procedure includes the list of CSA-Z662-15 conditions to pay
                  attention to during patrols. Through a review of inspection
                  reports, the Board confirmed that inspection reports were
                  being generated after each inspection. However, a review of a
                  sample of ground and aerial inspection reports identified that
                  these reports did not include confirmation that the
                  CSA-Z662-15 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1. conditions and Right of Way
                  Maintenance and Surveillance Procedure activities were being
                  monitored or assessed during patrols. The Board noted that the
                  inspection reports did not account for the monitoring of
                  conditions and activities as listed in CSA. Instead these
                  reports stated either “no issues” or listed potential
                  unauthorized activities. The Board is of the view that only
                  reporting what is out of the norm, or by exception, does not
                  typically allow for a demonstration of the ongoing monitoring
                  of developing trends that can affect the safety and operation
                  of the pipeline nor does it confirm with documentation that an
                  assessment of the various potential issues has occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board noted that the majority of the ROW that was
                  inspected during the audit was maintained for visibility and
                  appropriate signage present. However, despite being in areas
                  that are patrolled frequently, the Board identified several
                  instances where ROW signage was inadequate. There were
                  locations where signage was not legible, obscured by
                  vegetation, or damaged or missing and therefore did not meet
                  the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-15. In order to promote
                  timely resolution of these non-compliances, they were
                  addressed through the Board’s inspection process. However, the
                  Board considers that these deficiencies indicate inconsistent
                  and inadequate implementation of Trans-Northern’s Right of Way
                  Maintenance and Surveillance Procedure and Trans-Northern’s
                  Pipeline Integrity Management Standard. These deficiencies are
                  an indicator that Trans-Northern has not assessed the
                  effectiveness of these patrols to ensure they are meeting all
                  of the expectations of the legal requirements as well as
                  Trans-Northern’s procedures.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Due to the fact that both the aerial and ground  patrols 
                  report by exception, that is, only note when activity or an
                  issue is present, Trans-Northern could not demonstrate that it
                  is monitoring all the issues as noted in CSA&nbsp;Z662-15
                  clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1. As a result, the Board has determined
                  that Trans-Northern is in non-compliance with this
                  requirement. The Board requires that a CAP be developed to
                  address this non-compliance.

                  2.3 Frequency of inspections (CSA&nbsp;clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2)
                </h4>
                <p>
                  As detailed in section&nbsp;1.0 of this appendix,
                  Trans-Northern patrols its ROW at scheduled intervals and
                  various means. Trans-Northern provided documentation related
                  to its patrols and ROW maintenance standards. Section&nbsp;7
                  of Trans-Northern’s Pipeline Integrity Management Standard
                  (PIMS) includes a list of 17&nbsp;areas that have been
                  designated “elevated consequence areas” based on the potential
                  consequences of an incident at those locations. According to
                  the PIMS Section&nbsp;7.14.6 Inspection, Testing, Patrol and
                  Monitoring Frequency, these areas are “subject to more rigid
                  operational and pipeline monitoring standards”. In fact,
                  “Right of Way” inspection is listed as one of the
                  9&nbsp;action categories in place to monitor these areas.
                  Interviews and document review confirmed that these areas are
                  subject to ground patrol at a frequency of a minimum of every
                  10&nbsp;days. These areas are also monitored by aerial patrol
                  on a weekly basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Trans-Northern was able to demonstrate that it has
                  designated certain areas as Elevated Consequence Areas (ECAs)
                  and that this designation had an impact on patrol frequency,
                  Trans-Northern did not provide documented criteria for
                  establishing its frequency of patrols. Without criteria for
                  determining the ECAs, the Board was unable to establish which
                  factors were used to determine “the consequence of a leak” for
                  the ECAs. Further, in its determination of patrol frequency in
                  the absence of criteria, Trans-Northern could not demonstrate
                  that it has considered all of the factors listed in CSA
                  clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2 which represent inherent hazards that
                  could affect the probability of an incident such as population
                  density or land-use.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Although Trans-Northern demonstrated that it had established a
                  frequency for its patrols, it did not provide its criteria for
                  the determination of frequency and therefore could not
                  demonstrate it was considering all of the factors as required
                  by CSA&nbsp;Z662-15 clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2. As a result, the
                  Board has determined that Trans-Northern is in non-compliance
                  with this requirement. The Board requires that a CAP be
                  developed to address this non-compliance.

                  activity (DPR&ndash;O&nbsp;s.7)
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The Board issued the Order&nbsp;MO-21-2010, Exemption Order
                  Respecting Crossings By Agricultural Vehicles Or Mobile
                  Equipment on 22&nbsp;December 2010. This Order required that
                  regulated companies identify areas of their rights-of-way
                  where low-risk agricultural crossings may jeopardize the safe
                  and secure operation of the pipelines. In its 30&nbsp;March
                  2011 submission to the Board, Trans-Northern reported, that
                  while several specific sections of its pipeline have been
                  surveyed to identify locations where low-risk agricultural
                  crossings may jeopardize the safe and secure operation of its
                  pipeline, it had not conducted an “end to end depth of cover
                  survey” of the pipeline. In interviews, staff indicated that
                  depth of cover was evaluated during maintenance activities or
                  when the pipe was exposed for crossings. Staff also indicated
                  that Trans-Northern will be capturing depth of cover readings
                  in the ESRI database as part of the GIS system that is
                  currently being implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this audit, Trans-Northern provided its Risk Assessment
                  Worksheet which includes third party strikes, third party
                  damage and ROW encroachments. Although not an identified
                  hazard, Trans-Northern monitors depth of cover when a pipe is
                  exposed during integrity digs, third party crossings and other
                  maintenance activity. Also, Trans-Northern notes instances of
                  exposed pipe discovered during its patrols activities. Upon
                  review of the annual line walk reports, the Board noted
                  instances where sections of exposed pipe were reported,
                  Trans-Northern was not able to demonstrate that it had tracked
                  these issues to resolution. This issue is examined further in
                  <a href="#nnxii">Appendix&nbsp;II</a> of this report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that is has a process for
                  proactively monitoring depth of cover on agricultural lands
                  that would enable it to identify areas where low-risk
                  agricultural activity would jeopardize the safety of the
                  pipeline.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern could not demonstrate that it has procedures or
                  patrols to monitor depth of cover to identify areas where
                  low-risk agricultural activities would jeopardize the safety
                  of the pipeline as required by the DPR&ndash;O&nbsp;s.7. As a
                  result, Trans-Northern is in non-compliance with this
                  requirement. The Board requires that a CAP be developed to
                  address this non-compliance.

                  for reporting incidents and unauthorized activities to the
                  Board. Through interviews and record review, the audit
                  verified that Trans-Northern staff and contractors follow this
                  procedure when they discover unauthorized activities on the
                  ROW during patrols.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern was able to demonstrate that it has a process
                  in place to report instances of potential unauthorized
                  activities. It also demonstrated that these unauthorized
                  activities are documented and reported to the Board,
                  communicated throughout the organization and tracked to
                  resolution. It also demonstrated that it was tracking,
                  trending and reporting annually on the unauthorized activities
                  to Senior Management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern’s field staff were conducting inspections of
                  its rights of way with aerial, vehicle and foot patrols in
                  accordance with its 2016 Right of Way Maintenance and
                  Surveillance Procedure. Through document and record reviews
                  and interviews in the regions, the Board confirmed that
                  Trans-Northern staff were aware of the inspection and related
                  reporting requirements particularly as they relate to
                  potential mechanical damage from unauthorized third party
                  activities. However, Trans-Northern was not able to provide an
                  assessment of its aerial patrol program which would confirm
                  that this type of inspection meets the intent of the
                  regulatory requirements and considered to be effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A review of the aerial patrol reports filed by the pilot
                  indicates that the pilot identifies areas where construction /
                  excavation activity is occurring. In order to test the
                  effectiveness of the particular patrol, Trans-Northern does
                  not advise the pilots of planned activity along the ROW.
                  Record review indicates that where the pilot reports “Ongoing
                  construction near PL”, staff in the office review the patrol
                  report and verify with a check mark whether the construction
                  sites are known to Trans-Northern. Once reported to the Board,
                  these hard copy files are then filed electronically or kept in
                  hard copy at the office depending on the region.

                  Given the scope of the audit and the documents reviewed, the

                  As this audit was conducted of the pipeline patrol activities,
                  Trans-Northern provided its Policy on Environment, Health,
                  Safety, Security, Emergency Response and Operational Integrity
                  as signed by the President and CEO dated April 2015 and its

                  public and worker safety when performing patrol-related
                  activities. These employees and contractors described personal
                  authority and obligation to intervene with third parties to
                  ensure that the procedures were being adhered to during
                  activities along the rights-of-way.

                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Trans-Northern has the policies to
                  address the above expectations as they relate to inspection
                  and monitoring. Based on the review conducted and considering
                  the scope of this audit, the Board did not identify any issues
                  of non-compliance in relation to sub-element&nbsp;1.2 &ndash;
                  Policy and Commitment.

                <h5>NEB Assessment</h5>
                <h6>Identifying Hazards and Potential Hazards and Inventory</h6>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern provided a number of documented procedures
                  related to hazard identification for review including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Right of Way Maintenance and Surveillance Procedures;</li>
                  <li>Event Reporting and Investigation Procedure; and</li>
                  <li>Event Reporting Policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The Rights-of-way (ROW) Surveillance Procedure outlines how
                  hazards and potential hazards are identified through periodic
                  monitoring of the conditions and activities along its right of
                  way through aerial and ground patrols. The procedure makes
                  reference to the various activities and conditions that “shall
                  be given attention” that corresponds with the CSA&nbsp;Z662-11
                  clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1. The procedure also lists specific
                  activities and conditions that should be monitored during
                  aerial patrols and foot patrols. It is unclear from the
                  documentation provided if these conditions and activities as
                  identified in the procedures form part of the Trans-Northern
                  inventory of hazards and potential hazards or if they are
                  listed only in the procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern also provided the section of its TNPI Risk High
                  Level Risk Assessment worksheet that applies to its patrols.
                  This spreadsheet includes a static list of identified risks,
                  potential impacts, mitigations in place and the mitigation
                  required. The audit found that Trans-Northern’s worksheet is
                  comprised of high level risk categories such as encroachment
                  and loss of containment due to third party strike.
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that this list was
                  capturing newly identified or specific risks on the ROW from
                  its patrols for evaluation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, although patrols are included in the worksheet as a
                  mitigation or control in place for the identified risk of
                  third party damage, Trans-Northern did not include any details
                  or evaluation criteria that are applied to determine their
                  effectiveness. Statements such as “Consider further controls
                  to protect pipeline” or “No further actions to be taken” were
                  noted. The worksheet also included recommendations to be
                  implemented with no target date assigned. In the Board’s view,
                  these statements do not reflect an adequate assessment of
                  these hazards or the proposed controls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Companies are required to have an established, implemented and
                  effective process for the internal reporting of hazards,
                  potential hazards, incidents, and near-misses and for taking
                  corrective and preventive actions, including the steps to
                  manage imminent hazards. At the time of the audit,
                  Trans-Northern was using Intelex software which allows its
                  personnel to enter hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                  near-misses as they are identified. A review of patrol reports
                  indicated that reports of unauthorized activity such as
                  encroachments were being entered into the system from patrol
                  reports. However, the audit found that although some
                  environmental and integrity hazards were being identified by
                  the various patrol activities, they were not being captured
                  and added to the worksheet or the Intelex system. The Board
                  also noted that Trans-Northern did not have procedures to
                  ensure that all identified hazards from the patrols for each
                  region were being in entered into Intelex for evaluation and
                  management.
                </p>
                <h6>Analysis of Hazards and Potential Hazards</h6>
                <p>
                  During the audit, Trans-Northern provided documentation
                  demonstrating that it had conducted an analysis of the
                  occurrences of unauthorized activities reported on or near its
                  ROW to senior management. According to the analysis, many of
                  these occurrences were discovered during patrol activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that hazard
                  identification from other protection programs was informing
                  the patrols. For example, although invasive species was
                  identified as an environmental issue on the ROW,
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that its staff or
                  contractors conducting patrols were aware or trained to
                  identify this issue during patrols and report back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the exception of hazards related to third party damage
                  discussed above, the Board found no documentation to indicate
                  that all new hazards or potential hazards identified by
                  patrols are being analyzed, communicated or assessed. As a
                  result, the Board requires that Trans-Northern develop a CAP
                  to address this non-compliance. (see section&nbsp;3.5 of this
                  Report)
                </p>
                <h6>Controls</h6>
                <p>
                  Based on the review of documents provided, the Board noted
                  that Trans-Northern was able to demonstrate that it has
                  established patrol activities as controls for hazards on the
                  ROW. The audit found that Trans-Northern conducts frequent and
                  various types of patrols, as discussed in
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Regarding its patrol activities, Trans-Northern demonstrated
                  that it has established and implemented some aspects of Hazard
                  Identification, Risk Assessment and Controls. Based on the
                  documents provided and interviews with staff and contractors,
                  the Board determined that Trans-Northern focuses its patrol
                  activities on the identification of hazards and potential
                  hazards related to damage prevention and third party activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The audit found that other potential hazards that were listed
                  in the ROW procedure were not being adequately accounted for
                  during patrols. In particular, Trans-Northern was not able to
                  demonstrate that its patrols were consistently identifying
                  environmental or integrity-related hazards or potential
                  hazards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, with the exception of damage prevention, Trans-Northern
                  did not demonstrate a fully implemented process for the
                  evaluation of risk as described in the regulations. As a
                  result, the Board finds Trans-Northern in non-compliance with
                  the requirements of NEB OPR&nbsp;sections&nbsp;6.5(1)(e)and
                  (f) to evaluate and manage risks and develop and implement
                  corresponding controls and requires Trans-Northern develop a
                  CAP to address these deficiencies.

                    Expectations: The company shall have an established,

                    monitoring compliance with, all legal requirements that are
                    applicable to the company in matters of safety, security and
                    protection of the environment. The company shall have and
                    maintain a list of those legal requirements. The company
                    shall have a documented process to identify and resolve
                    non-compliances as they relate to legal requirements, which

                <p>
                  Trans-Northern provided its overarching Operations Excellence
                  Management System (OEMS) document as part of the review. This
                  high level document dated 2015, includes a section titled:
                  Element&nbsp;3- Legal Requirements and Compliance which
                  includes a description of the processes to monitoring
                  compliance that are to be developed and implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The scope of this audit does not include an evaluation of
                  Trans-Northern’s overall compliance monitoring processes.
                  Therefore within the scope of this audit, the Board reviewed
                  the excerpts from Trans-Northern’s legal list as it pertains
                  to patrols. For this review, Trans-Northern provided
                  concordance tables for the regulations directly related to the
                  patrol activities. These concordance tables included a
                  breakdown of the legal requirements contained within the OPR
                  and the DPR and include the responsible position and documents
                  impacted by these requirements. The Board notes that the
                  concordance tables alone do not constitute a legal list as
                  required. However, Trans-Northern also provided its 2013
                  internal audit protocols for review. Developed by one of its
                  owner companies, the protocol was created from a list of
                  legislation provided by Trans-Northern. Upon review of these
                  protocols and considering the level of detail with which they
                  were prepared, the Board is of the view that this protocol was
                  derived using a methodology that demonstrates an acceptable
                  practice for the creation of a legal list. Therefore the Board
                  determined that because Trans-Northern had access to this
                  protocol, it has satisfied the requirements for a legal list
                  given the scope of this audit.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern demonstrated that it is tracking and listing
                  legal requirements in concordance tables. These tables
                  included the requirements listed in CSA Standards and were
                  linked to the company’s written policies, and procedures with
                  respect to patrols. In addition, Trans-Northern demonstrated
                  that it has access to a comprehensive protocol which was
                  applied to its operations during its 2013 internal audit to
                  identify non-compliances. As the compliance monitoring process
                  was out of scope for this audit, the Board did not evaluate
                  its adequacy. However, the Board notes that the protocol
                  originates from a related entity and has been applied to
                  Trans-Northern’s operations for its 2013 audit. Therefore, the
                  Board is of the view that if updated and maintained, this
                  protocol would provide Trans-Northern with the basis of a
                  legal list that would meet requirements for monitoring the
                  compliance of patrol activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, based on the review conducted and considering the
                  scope of this audit, the Board did not identify any issues of
                  non-compliance in relation to sub-element&nbsp;2.2 Legal
                  Requirements.

                  The Board requires the company to document its policies and
                  goals for ensuring its activities are conducted in a manner
                  that ensures the safety and security of the public, workers
                  and pipeline, and the protection of property and the

                <p>
                  Trans-Northern’s corporate Goals, Objectives and Targets
                  (GOTs) are set annually by the president and then communicated
                  to staff through the performance review. These goals are then
                  cascaded down to the department, leadership and staff levels
                  and include the targets and measures that correspond to their
                  level and duties. During the audit, Trans-Northern
                  demonstrated that its performance management reports
                  illustrate the line of site from corporate to team to each
                  individual’s goals and that its goals were linked to the
                  reduction of incidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For staff conducting patrols, this line of sight was
                  established from the corporate goal to “Ensure safe and
                  reliable operations” directly to their tasks related to right
                  of way maintenance and monitoring. These goals were reviewed
                  throughout the year as a measure of performance. Although
                  there were no corporate goals specifically related to patrol
                  activities, Trans-Northern was reporting on unauthorized
                  activities.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Trans-Northern has established GOTs in
                  accordance with the above expectations as they relate to
                  inspection and monitoring. Based on the review conducted and
                  considering the scope of this audit, the Board did not
                  identify any issues of non-compliance in relation to

                  At Trans-Northern, patrol activities for its NEB regulated
                  facilities are the responsibility of the Operations
                  Department, Field Services &ndash; East &amp; Product
                  Management. The Manager Field Services East reports to the
                  Senior Manager Operations who reports to the President and
                  CEO. Within the Field Services-East division, the Supervisors
                  are accountable for the patrol activities ROW surveillance
                  related activities in their respective areas. The patrol
                  activities in each area are conducted by selected pipeline
                  technicians. Trans-Northern provided position descriptions for
                  the Supervisor and Pipeline Technician&nbsp;4. The Board notes
                  that ROW maintenance and patrol duties were documented
                  responsibilities for these positions. Interviews confirmed
                  that staff understood their roles and responsibilities and
                  were aware of the reporting structure.

                <p>
                  Along with a documented organizational structure, the Board
                  expects companies to demonstrate an ongoing ability to sustain
                  its activities. The Board requires that companies demonstrate
                  that the human resources required to establish and maintain
                  its activities are sufficient to meet operational and
                  regulatory requirements based on an annual documented
                  evaluation of need. At Trans-Northern, the Senior Manager,
                  Operations is responsible for ensuring that the patrol and ROW
                  maintenance are adequately resourced. Through documentation
                  and interviews, Trans-Northern demonstrated that it includes
                  requirements for its current patrol schedule and related
                  activities into its documented assessment of resources.
                  Trans-Northern provided its assessment of ROW maintenance
                  activity levels relating to its “ask” for another pipeline
                  technician. In addition, Trans-Northern has standing
                  agreements with contractors for its aerial patrols, select
                  ground patrols as well as supplemental contractors who are
                  brought on during high volumes in order to meet demand and
                  service standards.

                  The Board requires that companies have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for developing and
                  implementing corrective, mitigative, preventive and protective
                  controls associated with the hazards and risks. Considering
                  that the scope of this audit is limited to the assessment of
                  patrol activities, the Board is of the view that
                  Trans-Northern conducts patrol activities as part of its suite
                  of controls for hazards on the ROW.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to its “Pipeline Integrity Management Standard
                  (PIMS)”, ROW monitoring and surveillance is considered as one
                  of its proactive controls for the threat of third party
                  mechanical damage. Also, in its procedures, Trans-Northern has
                  identified 17&nbsp;elevated consequence areas throughout its
                  system. According to the PIMS, there are 9 “action categories”
                  that have been applied to pipeline sections situated in
                  Elevated Consequence Area's. Right of Way inspection is listed
                  among the controls that have been implemented for these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a control measure, Trans-Northern has implemented patrol
                  activities to monitor several types of hazards. During the
                  audit, Trans-Northern was able to demonstrate that it has
                  established and implemented various types of patrol
                  activities. These activities were assessed in
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board also requires companies to establish and implement a
                  process for coordinating and controlling the operational
                  activities of employees and other people working with or on
                  behalf of the company so that each person is aware of the

                  promote its timely resolution, it was addressed through the
                  NEB inspection process.

                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board is of the view that the procedural deficiencies
                  relating to the reporting of imminent hazards were addressed
                  prior to the completion of this audit. As a result, based on
                  the scope of this audit and the information reviewed, the
                  Board did not identify any issues of non-compliance in
                  relation to sub-element 3.2 Operational Control &ndash; Upset
                  or Abnormal Conditions.

                  In June 2016 the NEB Damage Prevention Regulations (DPR) came
                  into effect. These regulations included provisions directly
                  impacts company’s surveillance and monitoring programs.
                  Trans-Northern provided evidence to demonstrate that the
                  corporate MOC process was being triggered for the changes
                  resulting from the DPRs.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  The audit verified that Trans-Northern has a Management of

                <p>
                  The Board requires companies to have processes for developing
                  competency requirements and training programs that provide
                  employees and other persons working with or on behalf of the
                  company with the training that will enable them to perform
                  their duties in a manner that is safe, ensures the security of
                  the pipeline and protects the environment. Given that the
                  scope of this audit is the patrol activities, the Board
                  focused its assessment of the training program and competency
                  evaluations on the expectations for staff and contractors who
                  conduct patrols.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board notes that Trans-Northern employees who conduct
                  patrols are required to participate in selected training and
                  mentoring. During interviews with Trans-Northern employees and
                  contractors, Trans-Northern demonstrated that the practices
                  described in Trans-Northern’s documentation were known and
                  understood across the system. Training records for employees
                  who conduct patrol indicate that Trans-Northern has
                  implemented training that relates directly to the ROW
                  Maintenance Procedure. The “Training Guide for Maintain Right
                  of Way” outlines the objectives, learning action, evaluation
                  methods used to train staff for patrol activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to the template provided for ROW maintenance, the
                  evaluation consists largely of mentoring and self-study. Staff
                  competence is reviewed and signed off by a mentor once
                  demonstrated. Records indicate that the ROW maintenance
                  training is taken only once. Trans-Northern did not
                  demonstrate that changes to the hazards, operations procedures
                  or legal requirements do not trigger the requirement for
                  additional training.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With respect to the management of the training and competency
                  requirements of its contract personnel who conduct patrols,
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that it has included these
                  contractors within a contractor management program that
                  includes a process for the evaluation of the contractors’
                  competency nor did Trans-Northern provide evidence of the
                  training, licenses and requirements for contractors. Also,
                  Trans-Northern did not provide records to demonstrate that
                  contract ROW pilots were evaluated as required by
                  Trans-Northern ROW Maintenance and Surveillance Procedure
                  section&nbsp;3.5.5.1. In addition, at the time of the audit,
                  new aerial patrol spotters were being trained using outdated
                  procedures and were not aware of the current legislation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board also requires companies to have established,
                  implemented and effective process for making employees and
                  other persons working with or on behalf of the company aware
                  of their responsibilities in relation to the processes and
                  procedures required by the management system or the company’s
                  protection programs. The Board included these requirements in
                  its assessment as they pertain to patrols.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During its review of the training for patrols, the Board noted
                  that Trans-Northern has accounted for some hazards in its
                  training program. For example, staff who conduct patrols have
                  the potential to encounter hostile third parties during the
                  performance of patrols. Trans-Northern has provided evidence
                  that it has a Violence in the Workplace Policy in place as
                  required by the Canada Occupational Health and Safety
                  Regulations Part XX. Trans-Northern also provided records
                  demonstrating that its staff who conduct patrols have received
                  Workplace Violence and Harassment training. Trans-Northern
                  provided records demonstrating that contractors receive the
                  Health and Safety Orientation Certificate of training which
                  includes aspect of expected behavior and standards for
                  Trans-Northern health and safety. The audit identified that
                  there was no procedures or awareness provided to the
                  contractors that outlined Trans-Northern’s expectations in the
                  event that they encounter hostility during potential
                  interactions with the public or third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During its review of the ROW Maintenance and Surveillance
                  procedures, the Board noted that Trans-Northern identified
                  several potential conditions on and adjacent to the ROW that
                  staff and contractors (including pilots) were expected to
                  report on during patrols. Interviews confirmed that staff and
                  contractors were aware of how to identify construction related
                  or third party excavation activity on or near the ROW and how
                  to report this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Board also noted that the training provided to staff who
                  conduct patrols did not account for all of the
                  responsibilities and expectations outlined in the ROW
                  Surveillance procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along with third party activity, the procedures include the
                  requirement for staff and contractors to monitor and report on
                  conditions such as “erosion, washout, subsidence, scour, loss
                  of cover, and soil conditions which would endanger the
                  pipeline” as the environmental or integrity related issues.
                  Trans-Northern could not demonstrate that it has developed or
                  provided staff and contractors with the training or awareness
                  that would enable them to identify these issues while on
                  patrol.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  While Trans-Northern demonstrated that it has developed and
                  implemented a process for identifying, tracking and managing
                  training, the Board determined that its suite of training is
                  incomplete for staff and contractors involved in patrols. The
                  Board also found that Trans-Northern has not established and
                  implemented a process for identifying and verifying
                  competencies with respect to its patrol activities. As a
                  result, the Board finds Trans-Northern in non-compliance with
                  NEB OPR&nbsp;s. 6.5(1)(k). The Board requires Trans-Northern
                  to develop a corrective action plan to address the described
                  deficiencies.

                <p>
                  During the audit, Trans-Northern provided documentation and
                  records indicating that it has external and internal processes
                  for communicating information and processes relating to its
                  ROW maintenance and surveillance program.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern indicated that its primary communication tool
                  for external stakeholders was its website. The website page
                  “Our Commitment” provides external parties with information
                  related to types of patrols it conducts. Trans-Northern
                  advised that it does an annual letter mailout to its
                  landowners with information specific to ROW patrols. In
                  addition, Trans-Northern stated that it contacts directly
                  affected landowners when there is to be brush clearing or
                  maintenance activities on their properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the time of the audit Trans-Northern had identified a
                  formal documented communication plan as an action item for
                  2016. While it has no formal internal communication plan,
                  Trans-Northern indicated that it communicates legislative
                  changes, information relating to safety, security and
                  protection of environment to its employees and tracks its
                  communication requirements through a “Stakeholder Map”
                  tracking system. The Board was provided with the following
                  methods and frequency of communication initiatives:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Emails;</li>
                  <li>
                    Unauthorized activities are communicated with field staff
                    and discussed at scheduled management meetings;

                </ul>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern was, however, unable to demonstrate a
                  communication process or procedure for the internal
                  communication of issues related to legal requirements, to
                  staff and contractors who conduct patrols. In addition, the
                  audit reviewed several patrol reports and noted that, with the
                  exception of damage prevention issues, Trans-Northern could
                  not demonstrate that it was communicating the issues noted on
                  patrol to the appropriate protection program to manage and
                  resolve. For example, there were instances of exposed pipe and
                  areas that required brushing identified by the annual line
                  walk. Trans-Northern could not provide records to demonstrate
                  that these issues had been communicated to the Operations
                  group or captured in the IFS system which generate work
                  orders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, Trans-Northern was not able to demonstrate that concerns
                  or issues identified by the protection programs are being
                  communicated to patrols for monitoring. For instance, there
                  was no link between its patrols and its environmental
                  protection program established for the monitoring of any
                  post-construction mitigation or potential encounter with
                  invasive species.

                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Based on the Board’s evaluation of Trans-Northern’s
                  communication practices against the requirements and the scope
                  of this audit, the Board has determined that Trans-Northern is
                  non-compliant with NEB OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(m).
                  Trans-Northern will have to develop corrective actions to
                  address the described deficiencies.

                <p>
                  The Board expects to have an established, implemented and
                  effective process for identifying the documents required for
                  the company to meet its obligations to conduct activities in a
                  manner that ensures the safety and security of the public,
                  company employees, the pipeline, and protection of property
                  and the environment. Trans-Northern’s document management
                  general requirements are outlined in Section&nbsp;4.1 of its
                  Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS). Given the
                  scope of this audit, the overall document management process
                  is out of scope for this audit and therefore was not reviewed
                  for its adequacy and effectiveness. During the audit,
                  Trans-Northern provided a demonstration of its document
                  management system, Intelex. This system is used to manage its
                  management systems documentation including its procedures,
                  legal requirements and management of change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Trans-Northern’s document management process does
                  include requirements for procedure reviews and updates, the
                  Board noted several deficiencies with the implementation of
                  this process Trans-Northern’s document control process related
                  to its patrol activities and procedures.   During the site
                  inspections, the Board noted that not all documents related to
                  patrols reviewed and updated with current legal requirements.
                  For example, the Board noted that the Right of Way Maintenance
                  and Surveillance Procedures were not updated contained
                  outdated CSA references and had not been revised to reflect
                  the June 2016 requirements from the DPRs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During interviews and inspections, the Board discovered that
                  the provision of current procedures to contractors was
                  inconsistent. This inconsistency resulted in long time
                  contractors not having the latest versions of the procedures.
                  In addition, the public awareness materials that staff and
                  contractors were providing to stakeholders during patrols were
                  found to be out of date. The Board also noted that every
                  employee and contractor who conducts patrols appears to use a
                  different reporting template which may result in inconsistent
                  reporting from region to region.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Based on the Board’s evaluation of Trans-Northern’s patrol
                  activities against the requirements, the Board has determined
                  that Trans-Northern is non-compliant with NEB
                  OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5(1)(o). Trans-Northern will have to
                  develop corrective actions to address the described

                  The Board expects companies to have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for reporting on hazards,
                  potential hazards, incidents and near-misses, and for taking
                  corrective and preventive actions. Given the focused scope of
                  this audit, the Board evaluated the processes described in the
                  expectations for this sub-element only as they related to
                  patrol activities.

                </h6>
                <p>
                  Through document and record reviews, the Board confirmed that
                  Trans-Northern had implemented a procedure for reporting and
                  tracking third party unauthorized activities. Trans-Northern
                  demonstrated that, once notified, field personnel conduct a
                  follow-up investigation on each reported unauthorized
                  activities, to determine if damage to the facilities or
                  environment had occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern demonstrated its Intelex database which was
                  designed to manage events reported based on the Trans-Northern
                  Event Reporting and Investigation Procedure. The Board noted
                  that unauthorized activities were documented in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the review of this database, the Board noted that
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that it was consistently
                  documenting and investigating issues besides unauthorized
                  activities that were identified during patrol activities, most
                  notably those issues noted during the annual line walk. As
                  discussed in sub-element&nbsp;3.5 of this report,
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that it has a process to
                  ensure that environmental or integrity issues noted in patrol
                  reports were being documented or communicated to the
                  appropriate group for tracking to resolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern discussed the role of its IFS system that it
                  uses to initiate, track and manage work orders including those
                  triggered by issues noted on patrol. Based on its review, the
                  Board found the system was not fully implemented as evidenced
                  by the following observations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    signage issues noted on patrols  that were not entered into
                    IFS and no follow-up was demonstrated;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    issues entered into IFS as a work order that were not
                    tracked or  actioned;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the process for identifying issues from patrols and entering
                    them into IFS varied between the regions;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    lack of consistency regarding which issues get actioned and
                    why; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    lack of documented procedures describing how accountability
                    for the work order is determined.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Also, Trans-Northern could not demonstrate that it conducts a
                  review of the IFS system and the work orders to ensure that
                  all of the issues, including those issues identified by
                  patrols are properly resolved and closed out in the system.
                </p>
                <h6>Trending and Analysis</h6>
                <p>
                  Given that the scope of this audit is limited to patrols, the
                  Board verified that Trans-Northern was conducting trending and
                  analysis regarding unauthorized activities, including those
                  activities identified by patrol. Trans-Northern provided
                  documentation related to its reporting of unauthorized
                  activities, as well as how they are managed to resolution. It
                  also demonstrated that unauthorized activities are being
                  tracked and incorporated into an annual report.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board finds that, aside from the reporting of potential
                  unauthorized activities as described in
                  <a href="#nnxi">Appendix&nbsp;I</a> of this report,
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that it has implemented a
                  consistent process for reporting hazards and potential hazards
                  that are identified by patrol activities and tracking them to
                  verify that they have been resolved. As a result, the Board
                  has determined that Trans-Northern is non-compliant with NEB

                <h5>NEB Assessment</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board expects companies to have an implemented and
                  effective quality assurance program for the management system
                  and for each protection program, including a process for
                  conducting regular inspections and audits and for taking
                  corrective and preventive actions if deficiencies are
                  identified. Considering the scope of this audit, the Board
                  only evaluated the quality assurance program as it applies to
                  the patrol activities.
                </p>
                <h6>Internal Audit</h6>
                <p>
                  The Board reviewed Trans-Northern’s 2013 internal audit of its
                  management system and compliance. This audit was conducted
                  using a comprehensive list of legal requirements, including
                  those that directly apply to the expectations and execution of
                  the patrol activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon a review of the findings relating to ROW maintenance, the
                  Board also noted that corrective actions related to patrol
                  activities from the 2013 audit CAP remained outstanding. For
                  example, contractor evaluation of competence and oversight
                  remains an issue in regards to the patrol activities. Also,
                  the 2013 audit identified deficiencies with the implementation
                  of corrective action and follow-up specifically related to
                  issues noted by ROW inspections.
                </p>
                <h6>Inspections</h6>
                <p>
                  Although patrol activities can be considered inspection
                  activities, these activities should also be reviewed as part
                  of a quality assurance program to verify that they are meeting
                  established objectives and to verify that the procedures
                  continue to be fit for purpose. Trans-Northern could not
                  demonstrate that it has conducted any reviews related to
                  evaluating the effectiveness of the patrol activities in
                  meeting its objectives.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                  Considering the scope of this audit, the Board determined that
                  Trans-Northern has an internal audit scope and schedule that
                  meets Board expectations with regards to patrol activities.
                  However, Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that the
                  corrective actions recommended for the operational areas were
                  applied to the patrol activities. Also, Trans-Northern could
                  not demonstrate that it has conducted any reviews to determine
                  whether its patrol activities are adequate or effective. As a
                  result, the Board has determined that Trans-Northern is
                  non-compliant with NEB OPR&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.5(1)(w). The
                  Board requires Trans-Northern to develop a corrective action
                  plan to address the described deficiencies.

                <p>
                  Trans-Northern’s requirements for records management are
                  outlined in Section&nbsp;4.1 of its Operational Excellence
                  Management System (OEMS) dated 30 November 2015. The overall
                  document management process is out of scope for this audit and
                  therefore was not reviewed for its adequacy and effectiveness.
                  Also, the TNPI PIMS includes a table that outlines basic
                  records retention criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the time of the audit, the Board observed that
                  Trans-Northern maintained several databases to manage its
                  documents, records and information that relate to and result
                  from its patrol activities. These records management systems
                  include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    IFS &ndash; This database manages and tracks work orders
                    including those triggered by issues noted on patrols (e.g.
                    sign replacement).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ESRI &ndash; This database is linked to the IFS work orders.
                    It includes the GPS mapping tool capabilities that
                    Trans-Northern is implementing to map activities and issues
                    along its ROW.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Intelex-This database is used to support its management
                    system in areas such as the management of legal
                    requirements, document control, corrective action tracking
                    and hazard and near miss reporting including the reporting
                    of unauthorized activities.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern demonstrated that its various types of patrol
                  activities are documented in patrol reports. During the audit,
                  the Board noted that each location was managing the reports
                  differently. For example, some of the aerial and ground patrol
                  reports are scanned and kept on a shared drive. In other
                  locations, the aerial patrols were kept at the office in hard
                  copy only. The Board notes that Trans-Northern is in the
                  process of improving its records management and access with
                  the implementation of the ESRI database and its GIS components
                  for tracking and trending issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, Trans-Northern has not conducted an assessment or review
                  of its records management for patrol records to determine the
                  adequacy and effectiveness of its current practices in meeting
                  the requirements.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Considering the scope of this audit, the Board determined that
                  Trans-Northern has been documenting its patrol activities.
                  However, the Board has determined that Trans-Northern did not
                  demonstrate that it is managing its patrol records in
                  accordance with the requirements. As a result, the Board has
                  determined that Trans-Northern is non-compliant with NEB
                  OPR&nbsp;6.5 1(p). The Board requires Trans-Northern to
                  develop a corrective action plan to address the described
                  deficiencies.

                <h5>NEB Assessment</h5>
                <p>
                  The Board expects companies to have an established,
                  implemented and effective process for conducting an annual
                  management review of the management system and each protection
                  program. Trans-Northern provided its Operations Excellence
                  Management System (OEMS) for review as part of this audit.
                  Given that the scope of this audit is focused solely on patrol
                  activities and its links to the management system, the OEMS
                  was not reviewed or evaluated as part of the current audit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this audit, the Board identified several sub-elements
                  of the management system where established links can be
                  demonstrated between the management system and the patrol
                  activities including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>an HSE policy that reflects the Board’s requirements;</li>
                  <li>
                    goals, objectives and targets that align with from the
                    President’s level to the technician
                  </li>
                  <li>an annual report as required by the OPR;</li>
                  <li>
                    a compliance audit conducted which included an assessment of
                    aspects of patrol activities; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    demonstration of reporting regarding unauthorized
                    activities.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Given the variety and frequency of its patrol activities,
                  Trans-Northern appears to rely heavily on patrol activities to
                  identify hazards and potential hazards to its pipelines.
                  Despite this emphasis on ROW monitoring, the Board noted that
                  Trans-Northern Senior Management has failed to demonstrate
                  adequate oversight of these activities to determine their
                  effectiveness. In the Board’s view, this lack of oversight has
                  contributed to several issues noted during the audit.
                </p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    corrective actions related to the communication and
                    resolution of issues noted on patrol are only partially
                    implemented, despite having been identified in 2013 by an
                    internal audit;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    signage and ROW maintenance issues were noted during the
                    audit related inspections of areas that are patrolled daily;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    environmental and integrity issues identified by patrol, are
                    not being consistently included in the reporting and
                    monitoring; and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    despite frequency of patrols and the expectations outlined
                    in the procedures, there is no process in place to evaluate
                    patrol activities to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness
                    in meeting the intent of the regulations or Trans-Northern’s
                    procedures.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The Board holds Senior Management accountable for ensuring
                  continual improvement in meeting the company’s obligations to
                  perform its activities in a manner that ensures the safety and
                  security of the public, company employees, the pipeline, and
                  protection of property and the environment. Accordingly,
                  Senior Management is accountable to provide the direction for
                  the programs and activities and establish the focus for
                  continual improvement and the prioritizing corrective actions
                  from internal audit or compliance activities.
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Trans-Northern did not demonstrate that its management review
                  process is adequately ensuring the continual improvement of
                  its patrol activities by failing to require the evaluation of
                  these activities and failing to ensure the resolution of
                  deficiencies related to these activities. As a result, the
                  Board has determined that Trans-Northern is non-compliant with
                  NEB OPR&nbsp;s.&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;(1)(x). The Board requires
                  Trans-Northern to develop a corrective action plan to address
                  the described deficiencies.

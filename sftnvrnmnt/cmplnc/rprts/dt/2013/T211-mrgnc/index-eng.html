              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate effective and implemented Management
                Systems into their day-to-day operations. These systems include
                the tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure that
                pipelines are safe, and remain that way over time. Emergency
                management programs enable pipeline companies to respond
                efficiently and effectively in the event of an emergency
                situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s comprehensive audit of
                TransCanada’s Emergency Management Program as it applies to its
                NEB-regulated subsidiaries and pipeline facilities. The audit
                was conducted using the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline
                Regulations (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013. The
                OPR, among other things, requires companies to have an effective
                and well-documented emergency management program as a key
                component of their Management Systems. The OPR was promulgated
                with no implementation grace period for the Board’s regulated
                companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies five Management System elements. These five
                elements are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each
                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. The
                NEB requires companies to be compliant with one hundred percent
                of the regulatory requirements of a sub-element being assessed.
                If a company’s program is found to be deficient with respect to
                any regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element will be found
                in Non-Compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit finds TransCanada has developed an emergency
                management program that addresses the identified hazards and
                risks associated with potential incidents or emergencies on its
                pipelines. The documents and records reviewed during this audit
                demonstrate that TransCanada is ensuring company personnel,
                along with people living and working near pipelines, are
                appropriately informed of and/or trained in, emergency
                management practices and procedures in the event of an
                emergency. TransCanada has also demonstrated both that it has
                emergency response procedures in place for its facilities, and
                that these procedures are tested through an annual schedule of
                emergency response exercises, conducted across all of its
                operational regions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit also identified a number of Non-Compliant findings,
                the majority of which fall into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the lack of documented processes that correspond with the
                  Management System requirements as required by the recently
                  updated OPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the development and implementation of effective processes
                  related to ongoing, internal evaluation of the compliance to
                  legal requirements, and the adequacy and effectiveness of its
                  Emergency Management Program; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  full implementation of existing processes particularly
                  regarding the integration of external resources that play a
                  role in TransCanada’s emergency response.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, TransCanada must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval detailing how it
                intends to resolve Non-Compliances identified by this audit. The
                Board will assess the implementation of the corrective actions
                to confirm that they are completed in an expedient manner, and
                on a system-wide basis. The Board will also continue to monitor
                the overall implementation and effectiveness of TransCanada’s
                Management Systems through targeted compliance verification
                activities as a part of its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, independent and documented
                process for obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively to
                determine the extent to which audit criteria are fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> Addresses the
                Non-Compliances identified in the Audit Report and explains the
                methods and actions which will be used to &quot;correct&quot;
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                adequacy of programs or elements in meeting the requirements of
                the <em>National Energy Board Act</em>, Part&nbsp;II of the
                <em>Canada Labour Code</em>, and their associated regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action must be
                developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order allowing individual
                activities to be completed in an effective and safe manner. The
                procedure will also outline roles, responsibilities and
                authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> A systematic series of actions or
                changes taking place in a definite order and directed towards a
                result.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures to regularly accomplish a result. The program
                outlines how plans and procedures are linked, and how each one
                contributes towards the result.

                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate a regulated company’s compliance with its
                regulations, the NEB undertakes Management System audits of its
                regulated companies. The NEB requires that each company
                demonstrate the adequacy and implementation of the methods the
                company has selected and employed in order to proactively
                identify and manage hazards and risks to achieve Compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the audits, companies are required to submit and
                implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all findings of
                Non-Compliance. The results of the audits are considered as a
                part of the NEB’s risk-informed life cycle approach to
                compliance assurance.

              <p>
                TransCanada operates approximately 42,000 km of federally
                regulated pipeline from British Columbia to Quebec. In order for
                the audit of TransCanada to reflect the way it runs its
                operations, the NEB audited each program separately. Therefore,
                this audit is one of a series of six program audits having been
                undertaken by the Board with respect to NEB-regulated facilities
                operated within TransCanada’s organization. The audits are
                titled:
              </p>

                </li>
                <li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                These audits identified that TransCanada operates its facilities
                using a common organizational and technical management structure
                for all of the facilities noted. Some of the findings are
                therefore similar in each audit, and the individual audit
                reports reflect this. During the audit, the Board reviewed and
                evaluated a sample set of facilities based on the individual
                activities, as well as the associated hazards and risks, as
                reflected in the individual audit reports. To evaluate its
                Emergency Management Program, the Board also attended some of
                TransCanada’s planned emergency response exercises.

              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to determine the adequacy and
                effectiveness of TransCanada’s Emergency Management Program. The
                requirements against which TransCanada was audited are contained
                within:

              </ul>
              <p>
                In utilising the OPR, the Board notes its amendment on
                21&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013, which clarified the Board’s
                expectations for establishing and implementing a formal
                Management System and Emergency Management Program. These
                amendments were preceded by consultation between the Board and
                its regulated companies, and accordingly the OPR was not
                promulgated with an implementation grace period. As a result,
                the audit of TransCanada’s Emergency Management Program was
                conducted using the amended OPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scope of the audit included the following companies that
                hold certificates to operate in Canada:
              </p>
              <ul>

                <li>NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These subsidiaries hold the certificates for TransCanada’s
                NEB-regulated facilities, which include the Canadian Mainline
                (operating under TransCanada PipeLines Limited), Keystone
                Pipeline (operating under TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP
                Ltd.), TQM Pipeline System (operating under Trans Québec &amp;

              <h2 id="s6">6.0 Audit Process and Methodology</h2>
              <p>
                TransCanada and its NEB-regulated subsidiaries operate
                approximately 42,000&nbsp;kilometres of federally regulated
                pipeline across the country. TransCanada and its subsidiaries
                operate these facilities using a common organizational and
                technical Management System. Accordingly, and in order to
                complete an assessment of its Management System in a reasonable
                timeframe, the Board elected to audit and assess a
                representative sample of TransCanada and its subsidiaries
                utilizing a risk-informed approach that included a review of
                previous compliance history.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board chose to use NGTL and the Alberta System as its
                representative sample. The Board also included areas of the
                TransCanada system presenting unique potential hazards to assess
                system-specific hazards. Due to the unique hazards introduced to
                an emergency management program by the transportation of liquids
                including oil, the specific processes, plans and procedures
                applicable to the Keystone pipeline were also reviewed.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has divided its Canadian facilities and assets into
                five operational regions. These regions are the Wildrose Region,
                Rocky Mountain Region, Central Region, Northern Ontario Region
                and Eastern Region. As TransCanada applies the same Emergency
                Management Program across all of its systems, any findings and
                corrective actions required will be applied across all of
                TransCanada’s systems and subsidiaries. The NEB will verify the
                implementation of any corrective actions with subsequent
                compliance verification activities at each subsidiary once
                TransCanada’s Corrective Action Plan has been approved by the
                Board, and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s utilization of one set of policies and procedures
                for its Emergency Management Program also guided the
                implementation of the Board’s audit process. Interviews and
                document review on the Emergency Management Program were
                conducted at the Head Office in Calgary, Alberta. Site visits
                were conducted at select NGTL facilities, and two field
                emergency response exercises were observed. During these site
                visits, activities were evaluated for each Management System
                element through interviews with a number of personnel at various
                levels, as well as document and record review.

              <p>
                The audit involved Board review of TransCanada company
                documents, interviewing company representatives at all levels of
                the organization, and conducting field verification of
                compliance with NEB requirements at selected sites. Information
                gathered was then synthesized using the Board’s established
                Audit Protocol.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 19&nbsp;June&nbsp;2013, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from TransCanada in Calgary, Alberta to discuss
                the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. A schedule for
                conducting the staff interviews and site verifications was also
                developed at this meeting. Throughout the audit, daily summaries
                with action items were provided to TransCanada.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 24&nbsp;October&nbsp;2013, the Board held an audit
                Pre-Close-Out meeting with TransCanada to discuss additional
                information that could be of value to the Board prior to
                compiling its draft audit report. An audit Close-Out meeting was
                held on 6&nbsp;November&nbsp;2013.

              <p>
                In addition to receiving oversight by the Emergency Management
                Program, TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline is subject to the
                TransCanada Emergency Response Program. As an oil transporting
                facility, it has its own emergency response procedures setting
                out the hazards, mapping, roles, response procedures, controls,
                response partners and other emergency management elements
                required for an effective emergency response in the event of an
                oil-related emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has also developed and implemented continuing
                education, liaison and awareness programs for the public, and
                first responders potentially involved in, or affected by, an
                emergency associated with its facilities. These programs are
                supported by TransCanada’s corporate Public Awareness Program.

              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies five Management System elements. These five
                elements are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each
                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. The
                NEB requires companies to be compliant with one hundred percent
                of the regulatory requirements of a sub-element being assessed.
                If a company is found to be deficient with respect to any
                regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element will be found
                Non-Compliant. A Corrective Action Plan will be required in
                order to demonstrate to the Board that appropriate actions will
                be taken to achieve full Compliance.
              </p>

                of this report.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;1.0 - Policy and Commitment</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 - Leadership and Accountability</h4>
              <p>
                The position of accountable officer was introduced into the OPR
                in April of&nbsp;2013. The Board is satisfied that TransCanada
                has appointed an accountable officer and outlined the
                responsibilities of this position in accordance with the
                regulations and submission deadlines. Subsequent NEB compliance
                activities will verify the adequacy and effectiveness of the
                process implementation once a full planning cycle has been
                completed. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada’s to be
                Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 - Policy and Commitment Statements</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established and implemented
                a Health Safety &amp; Environment Commitment Statement and Code
                of Business Ethics that include protection of the public,
                workers and the environment and immunity from disciplinary
                action for employees that report any actual or suspected
                violation of the law. Following review, the Board has determined
                that these documents do not demonstrate the existence of
                policies for the internal reporting of hazards, potential
                hazards, incidents and near-misses that includes the conditions
                under which a person who makes a report will be granted immunity
                from disciplinary action. As a result, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;2.0 - Planning</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.1 - Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment
                and Control
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that overall, its Emergency Management
                Program incorporates processes to assess risk, identify hazards,
                and introduce controls to mitigate them. The Board also
                considers TransCanada’s hazard identification and risk
                assessment process for the Keystone pipeline to be adequate as
                it identifies and verifies both highly sensitive receptors, and
                control points for the execution of emergency response
                activities to mitigate the consequences of an emergency event.
                Given, however, that this process, and the similar processes for
                its gas carrying facilities were not demonstrated to be fully
                implemented, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant
                with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 - Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated it is tracking, listing and conducting
                some internal notifications regarding its legal responsibilities
                as it related to regulatory changes. However, it did not
                demonstrate it has, or maintains, a complete list of legal
                requirements. It also did not demonstrate an effective process
                to ensure regulatory changes trigger necessary program changes
                or communication to all staff involved in the Emergency
                Management Program. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to
                be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.3 - Goals, Objectives and Targets</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it is establishing and tracking
                aspects of its emergency management performance specifically
                related to training and the testing of equipment. However,
                TransCanada did not demonstrate a documented process for
                development, implementation, maintenance and review of the
                adequacy and effectiveness of goals, objectives and targets for
                its Emergency Management Program. Also, while performance
                measures and targets exist for some components such as exercises
                and training, the Board found that TransCanada has not
                established goals, objectives and targets for other Emergency
                Management Program components such as consultation/continuing
                education and liaison with response agencies, response times and
                communications with stakeholders and the public. Based on all
                the foregoing, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant
                with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.4 - Organizational Structure, Roles and
                Responsibilities
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated it has a documented organizational
                structure for its Emergency Management Program. However, this
                structure did not in the Board’s view, demonstrate that
                TransCanada’s annual organizational evaluation effectively
                assesses the external human resources needed to respond to an
                incident. The Board believes external resources play an
                important role in the event of an emergency and finds that
                TransCanada’s monitoring of external human resources is not
                sufficient to meet the Board’s expectations. As such, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;3.0 - Implementation</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;3.1 - Operational Control-Normal Operations
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Board expects companies to have ongoing preparatory
                processes in place that function during normal operating
                conditions to develop and maintain effective emergency
                management programs, and implement continual improvement
                initiatives. Based on the information provided, the Board found
                TransCanada’s processes for developing and implementing
                corrective, mitigative, preventive and protective controls
                associated with the hazards and risks of its operations to meet
                its expectations. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;3.2 - Operational Control-Upset or Abnormal
                Operating Conditions
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Board notes that TransCanada has developed processes and
                plans to identify the potential for upset or abnormal conditions
                as well as methods to test the adequacy of its contingency
                plans. However, at the time of the audit, these processes and
                plans were not, in the Board’s view, fully implemented or
                effective to meet the Board’s expectations. As a result, the
                Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.3 - Management of Change</h4>
              <p>
                In the context of the Emergency Management Program, the Board
                noted integrated procedures that establish the process to
                identify a proposed change, the stakeholders involved, the steps
                to implement the change, and a target implementation date.
                However, the documents created by these procedures did not
                demonstrate that changes having an effect on emergency response
                planning were reflected in the Emergency Management Program
                through an update to procedures or response plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the context of broader management of change processes that
                could affect the Emergency Management Program, TransCanada did
                not demonstrate that it has an established and implemented a
                process for identifying and managing change that could affect
                safety, security or protection of the environment, including new
                hazards or risks, changes in design, specifications, standards
                or procedures, and change in the company’s organizational
                structure or the legal requirements. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;3.4 - Training, Competence and Evaluation
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated effective processes for developing and
                implementing competency requirements and training programs. For
                internal training, TransCanada has developed documented
                emergency management role training profiles and competency
                requirements for each role in the Emergency Management Program.
                There are requirements for regional and corporate employees with
                a potential emergency role to complete emergency training
                modules as set out in the emergency management role training
                profiles. Having all the required training is a key performance
                indicator in each employees’ documented annual performance
                agreement. TransCanada also provides experiential training to
                external parties through their participation in TransCanada’s
                field and table top exercise program. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.5 - Communication</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated a process relating to external and
                internal communication requirements that meets the Board’s
                expectations. For external communication, TransCanada’s
                Emergency Management Program has implemented a plan directed at
                its external stakeholders, including first responders and
                adjacent landowners and has integrated some of the outreach
                components of its Emergency Management Program with its Public
                Awareness Program for the purposes of communication,
                consultation, and liaison with, first response agencies and
                other services that may have a response role in the event of a
                TransCanada pipeline incident. TransCanada also uses several
                methods to communicate emergency management information across
                its organization. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.6 - Documentation and Document Control</h4>
              <p>
                The Board found TransCanada’s process relating to establishing
                and implementing effective processes for identifying and
                managing documents required to meet its expectations. This
                process creates a framework for the development and maintenance
                of the documentation necessary for TransCanada employees and
                contractors to efficiently and correctly conduct the operational
                and maintenance activities associated with TransCanada’s
                facilities. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;4.0 - Checking and Corrective Action</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;4.1 - Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has implemented effective
                processes for inspecting and monitoring its activities and
                facilities and for evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of
                its Emergency Management Program. TransCanada also demonstrated
                that it has several processes for inspecting and monitoring its
                equipment, activities and emergency response plans related to
                its Emergency Management Program, and several methods to monitor
                and measure its performance. As a result, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;4.2 - Investigating and Reporting Incidents and
                Near-misses
              </h4>
              <p>
                This sub-element was examined through review of TransCanada’s
                Incident and Issue Tracking process, its intended function, and
                how its function is demonstrated within the overall
                HS&amp;E&nbsp;Management System. In addition, the Board assessed
                how the process is communicated to employees. TransCanada was
                able to demonstrate that it has a process in place to identify,
                track, analyze and resolve emergency management issues and
                incidents throughout its Incident and Issue Management Program
                that reflects the Board’s expectations. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.3 - Internal Audit</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its quality assurance
                program is implemented on a scale that exceeds the Board’s
                expectations with respect to frequency. However, its
                implementation to measure performance relative to internal
                TransCanada requirements that are derived from statutory
                requirements does not meet the Board’s expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board is of the view that companies must have a process
                whereby the status of the program’s compliance with the express
                statutory requirements can be verified. As a result, and given
                TransCanada did not demonstrate it has or maintains a complete
                list of legal requirements, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.4 - Records Management</h4>
              <p>
                The Board found TransCanada’s process relating to generating,
                retaining, and maintaining records that document the
                implementation of the management system and its protection
                programs and for providing access to those who require them, to
                meet its expectations. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada
                to be Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;5.0 - Management Review</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;5.1 - Management Review</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it is undertaking a significant
                number of management review activities consistent with the
                descriptions included in TransCanada’s Health Safety &amp;
                Environment Framework document. However, the Board considers
                senior management’s involvement and performance in particular
                areas to be critical. These include evaluating and managing the
                results of audits, and the results of compliance verification
                activities conducted by regulatory agencies. The Board has made
                findings of non-compliance in other sub-elements dealing with
                the development of the scope of company audits, and the
                development and implementation of corrective action plans, which
                it views to properly fall within the care and control of senior
                management. In addition, TransCanada was unable to demonstrate a
                documented and comprehensive management review process of the
                Emergency Management Program describing activities for
                adequately and effectively undertaking management reviews on a
                consistent basis and for ensuring continual improvement. As a
                result, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element.

              <h2 id="s10">10.0 Conclusions</h2>
              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate effective and well-implemented
                Management Systems into their day-to-day operations. These
                programs include the tools, technologies and actions needed to
                ensure that pipelines are safe and remain that way over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of this audit TransCanada was required to
                demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of its Management
                System and Emergency Management Program. The Board reviewed
                documentation and records provided by TransCanada, conducted
                interviews with TransCanada staff and attended TransCanada’s
                emergency response exercises. Based on this review, the Board
                finds TransCanada has developed and implemented an Emergency
                Management Program that addresses significant identified hazards
                and risks associated with potential incidents or emergencies on
                its pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the scope of work being undertaken by
                TransCanada and its processes in place, the audit identified a
                number of non-compliant findings, the majority of which fall
                into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the lack of documented processes that correspond with the
                  Management System requirements as required by the recently
                  updated OPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the development and implementation of effective processes
                  related to ongoing, internal evaluation of the compliance to
                  legal requirements, and the adequacy and effectiveness of its
                  Emergency Management Program; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  full implementation of existing processes particularly
                  regarding the integration of external resources that play a
                  role in TransCanada’s emergency response.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that while no immediate enforcement
                actions are required to address these Non-Compliant findings, as
                per the Board’s standard audit practice, TransCanada must
                develop and submit a Corrective Action Plan describing its
                proposed methods to resolve the non-compliances identified, and
                the timeline in which corrective actions will be completed.
                TransCanada will be required to submit its Corrective Action
                Plan for approval within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report
                being issued by the Board. The Board will make its Final Audit
                Report and TransCanada’s approved corrective action plan public
                on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of TransCanada’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of TransCanada’s Emergency
                Management Program and management system as a whole through
                targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
                ongoing regulatory mandate.

                the identity of the accountable officer within 30&nbsp;days of
                the appointment and ensure that the accountable officer submits

              <p>
                Following the release of the amended OPR on
                10&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013, the National Energy Board (Board or
                NEB) gave its regulated companies 30&nbsp;days to submit written
                notice of both the identity of their accountable officers and
                the acceptance by these persons of the responsibilities attached
                to this position. On 10&nbsp;May&nbsp;2013, TransCanada
                submitted its written notice to the NEB indicating that its
                Executive Vice President of Operations and Major Projects had
                been appointed as accountable officer for TransCanada and all of
                its subsidiaries. In its submission, TransCanada confirmed that
                its accountable officer has the authority over the human and
                financial resources required to meet the Board’s substantive
                expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the legal requirement to appoint an
                accountable officer was introduced into the OPR in April
                of&nbsp;2013 with the audit commencing in June&nbsp;2013. As a
                result, this role at TransCanada had only been in effect for
                approximately two months and the accountable officer was not
                able to complete an annual planning cycle that would allow for
                the Board’s evaluation of the substantive responsibilities
                attached to this position. In this context, the Board is
                satisfied in its assessment that TransCanada has appointed an
                accountable officer and outlined the responsibilities of this
                position to the Board in accordance with the regulatory
                requirements and submission deadlines. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada’s to be Compliant with this sub-element.

                shall include goals for the prevention of ruptures, liquids and

                The company shall have a policy for the internal reporting of

                The Commitment Statement outlines the leadership commitment and
                guidance for the 11&nbsp;elements that make up TransCanada’s
                HS&amp;E Management System. Within the HS&amp;E Management
                System, its Element&nbsp;7 Emergency Preparedness and Response
                (Element&nbsp;7) sets out TransCanada’s approach to health,
                safety and environmental governance and the achievement of the
                Commitment Statement as it relates specifically to the company’s
                EM&nbsp;Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to its Commitment Statement, TransCanada provided
                its Code of Business Ethics for review, which includes the
                requirement for TransCanada staff to report any actual or
                suspected violation of the law without fear of retaliation.
                TransCanada has also implemented an Incident Management Program
                to manage the reporting of violations, hazards and potential
                hazards that &quot;encourages notification of all
                incidents&quot;. In the Board’s view, these documents do not
                meet the Board’s expectations because it is not explicit in
                these documents that there is a policy indicating that
                TransCanada staff who reported deficiencies, hazards or risks
                associated with the EM Program would be protected from
                disciplinary action.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established and implemented
                an HS&amp;E Commitment Statement, an Incident Management Program
                and Code of Business Ethics that include protection of the
                public, workers and the environment and, to certain extent,
                provides for immunity from disciplinary action. Following review
                and consideration, however, for the reasons noted above, the
                Board has determined that these documents do not demonstrate the
                existence of policies that meet the criteria outlined in
                expectations. As a result, the Board has determined that this
                sub-element is Non-Compliant.

                TransCanada’s risk assessment and hazard identification process
                is rooted in Element&nbsp;2 of its HS&amp;E Management System:
                Risk and Regulatory Assessment. The process itself is comprised
                of, and enabled by, a number of tools including the HS&amp;E
                Risk Assessment TransCanada Operating Procedure (TOP)<sup
                  ><a href="#ftn2back" id="ftn2">[2]</a></sup
                >, the Emergency Event Analysis (EEA) and the HS&amp;E Risk
                Registry.
              </p>
              <p>
                The HS&amp;E Risk Assessment TOP applies to the identification
                and assessment of all hazards and risks associated with all
                TransCanada’s operations in North America, and establishes
                TransCanada’s internal conditions which trigger a risk
                assessment. These triggers include: a significant incident or
                trend of similar incidents; a change in regulatory requirement
                or social condition; need identified through an audit, or, in
                the absence of these, the elapsing of 12&nbsp;months since the
                last risk assessment. The HS&amp;E Risk Assessment TOP requires
                that a risk assessment be conducted that will result in an
                HS&amp;E Risk Registry and that will facilitate the proactive
                selection and implementation of controls to eliminate or
                mitigate identified or potential risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The EEA is used by regional staff to identify hazards and assess
                the risks posed by each hazard, to identify and prioritize the
                potential emergencies within each operational region<sup
                  ><a href="#ftn3back" id="ftn3">[3]</a></sup
                >, and to identify the appropriate controls (response plans) to
                mitigate the hazards, risks and potential emergency events.
              </p>
              <p>
                The HS&amp;E Risk Registry is a hierarchical inventory of the
                identified health safety and environmental risks at an
                organizational level at TransCanada, and includes regulatory,
                operational and line of business risk.
              </p>
              <p><em>Process Implementation - Gas</em></p>
              <p>
                To assess TransCanada’s process implementation for its gas
                facilities, the Board examined emergency management documents
                which identify hazards and risks, and which identify controls to
                mitigate the consequences of emergency events.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first of these was the TransCanada Emergency Management
                System Corporate Program Manual (Manual)<sup
                  ><a href="#ftn4back" id="ftn4">[4]</a></sup
                >, which constitutes TransCanada’s emergency response plan. It
                includes a step to identify emergency events and conduct a risk
                assessment using the EEA, provides an overview of the
                identification of emergency events, and for emergency response
                planning purposes, provides the distances of the emergency
                planning zones (EPZ) established for gas pipelines in Canada.
                While the Board noted the presence of emergency event lists,
                response procedures and EPZ distances in both the Manual, and
                the emergency response plan for TransCanada’s Keystone Pipeline
                System, TransCanada was not able to demonstrate that the
                HS&amp;E Risk Assessment TOP or EEA were effectively implemented
                to develop them. In the absence of demonstrated reliance on
                established processes, the completeness of these lists, response
                procedures, and distances could not be verified.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also noted that TransCanada’s HS&amp;E Risk Registry
                for the EM Program was incomplete. TransCanada stated that
                hazard inventories consisted of the EPZ, the lists of potential
                hazards, and the emergency events all listed in the Manual.
                However, the Board views the EPZ as not constituting, or
                contributing to, a hazard inventory, and the potential emergency
                events listed as not demonstrating an exhaustive list. While
                interviews referred to the IIT database for an inventory of
                hazards for emergency response for gas pipelines in Canada, the
                records reviewed did not include the hazard inventory for
                emergency response and/or trends.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the foregoing, TransCanada was not able to demonstrate
                that the processes established for risk assessment and hazard
                identification on its gas facilities relating to emergency
                management were effectively implemented. Similarly, TransCanada
                was not able to demonstrate that its inventory of hazards and
                potential hazards is being effectively maintained for its gas
                facilities.
              </p>
              <p><em>Process Implementation - Oil</em></p>
              <p>
                Document review confirmed that TransCanada implemented a hazard
                identification and risk assessment process specific to its
                Keystone pipeline. Review of this process indicated that it
                functions to identify 'highly sensitive receptors', such as
                special status species that could be affected by a spill, as
                well as 'high consequence areas', such as areas populated by
                people, drinking water intakes, and sensitive ecological
                resources. The process also prioritizes contributory pipeline
                segments based on potential hazards to these locales, and
                categorizes their hazard value based on their proximity,
                physical transport pathways and discharge volumes. The Board
                also reviewed the inventory of the pipeline segments that pose a
                potential hazard to sensitive Keystone locales, which included
                extensive material information such as kilometre posts, surface
                and subsurface transport pathways, and worst case spill volumes
                for specific waterways.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the document review, the Board conducted both
                head office and field interviews to further verify development
                and implementation of this particular process. Head office
                interviews indicated the EEA was used to identify that all
                above-ground facilities must have a site specific response plan.
                For the Keystone pipeline in Canada, it was confirmed that
                TransCanada’s integrity program identifies and ranks highly
                sensitive receptors, and then tactical response plans are
                developed by Regions under the Keystone emergency response plan
                to address them. These interviews confirmed that the tactical
                response plans are still under development and the inventory of
                hazards is maintained in the IIT system. TransCanada indicated
                that it’s Health Safety and Environment division is in the
                process of rolling out the risk assessment standard and the
                program is reviewing it for an implementation approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                Field interviews noted that highly sensitive areas such as the
                Assiniboine River, which was identified via use of the EEA, are
                defined by staff at TransCanada’s head office. These interviews
                also confirmed that the highly sensitive receptors identified,
                are also verified by TransCanada in the field, during which the
                further identification of strategic 'control points' occurs.
                These control points are assessed for their capacity to
                facilitate emergency response activities based on, among other
                things, the presence of adequate staging locations. While
                TransCanada has 68&nbsp;established control points on the
                Keystone pipeline, the Board noted at the time of the audit,
                that 12&nbsp;have not been fully assessed. As a result, the
                Board views TransCanada as having not verified that these
                control points are adequate to facilitate effective emergency
                response activities if an emergency event were to occur in their
                surroundings.
              </p>
              <p>
                In short sum, the Board considers TransCanada’s hazard
                identification and risk assessment process for the Keystone
                pipeline to be adequate as it identifies and verifies both
                highly sensitive receptors, and control points for the execution
                of emergency response activities to mitigate the consequences of
                an emergency event. The outstanding control point verification
                and tactical response plan development however indicate that
                this process has not been fully and effectively implemented in
                Canada.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, TransCanada demonstrated that its EM Program indeed
                incorporates processes to assess risk, identify hazards, and
                introduce controls to mitigate them. However, given the above,
                and that TransCanada was unable to demonstrate at the time of
                the audit, both the full implementation of its risk assessment
                and hazard identification process, and the adequate maintenance
                of its hazard inventory insofar as these mechanisms relate to
                its gas facilities, the Board is not able to find TransCanada to
                be Compliant with this particular sub-element.

              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it tracks changes in legal
                requirements using various methods including its subscription to
                an online third party regulatory tracking and notification
                service,  its own internal regular monitoring of government
                websites, and its participation in industry groups such as the
                Canadian Energy Pipelines Association (CEPA). Legislative
                changes are then entered into its IIT database as an 'issue',
                which is then delegated to the appropriate staff to action any
                changes required.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada provided a copy of its Legislative Monitoring
                Process document in support of its process for identifying and
                monitoring legal requirements. Last revised in&nbsp;2011, this
                document outlines the steps TransCanada takes to monitor
                legislation for any regulatory changes that could impact its
                pipe, energy and gas storage in Canada. The document also
                outlines that the Director or Vice President of a business unit
                impacted by a regulatory change is accountable to ensure
                conformance of company standards and specifications with  the
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process document formally indicates that it provides
                direction and describes the services and resources available for
                the review and management of identified regulatory requirements.
                It also includes a management of change process to affect
                changes where required. Substantively, however, the Board notes
                that the Legislative Monitoring Process is limited to listing
                legislation, and does not capture the legal requirements
                included in regulatory certificates. As such, the Board views
                its scope as not meeting the Board’s expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes further that while TransCanada’s list of
                statutory legal requirements is established and maintained, this
                list includes broad references to statutory instrument titles as
                opposed to their specific provisions. The Board is of the view
                that this lack of specificity does not support an effective
                process for identifying and monitoring compliance with all
                TransCanada’s legal requirements as specific provisions are
                often updated without an impact on the statutory enactment’s
                title.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit also identified issues with the implementation of the
                Legislative Monitoring Process as documented, particularly the
                adequacy of the review it had undergone. Specifically, the
                Board’s review of the document noted that, while it had a
                revision date within the bi-annual review period, the current
                version provided by TransCanada during the audit contained
                outdated information. One example was noted in &quot;Appendix A
                - Register of Applicable Regulatory agencies for Canadian and
                Mexican Pipelines and Canadian Gas Storage&quot; where contact
                information such as that for the Alberta Energy Regulator, was
                out of date.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada also indicated that it has incorporated the
                management of its legal requirements directly into its operating
                procedures through the TransCanada Operations Procedures (TOP)
                Program. TransCanada implemented this program to manage and
                control it’s over 200&nbsp;operational procedures and their
                related documents. TransCanada also indicated that within the
                TOP Program database, it has included its list of legal
                requirements. According to TransCanada staff, the TOP database
                lists all of the relevant legislation associated with the TOP
                procedures as well as the legislative driver, the contact who is
                responsible for managing the TOP, and any changes that are
                required. The TOP database also lists the regulation, and has
                the functionality to allow staff to electronically access the
                listed regulations. According to staff, TOP owners in their
                respective business units are responsible for monitoring the
                legal requirements that will impact its procedures during annual
                reviews. During interviews, TransCanada identified that
                individual TOP owners are responsible for ongoing monitoring of
                any legal change that would impact their respective programs.
                While this TOP process may function to track changes to legal
                requirements and integrate them to some extent, the Board has
                determined that it is not effective to address changes that
                would affect the EM Program, again given the legislation it
                lists for consideration includes predominantly legislative
                titles absent reference to their particular provisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the Legislative Monitoring Process document,
                TransCanada referenced other documents to demonstrate its
                compliance with this element. These included its Emergency
                Management Corporate Program Manual, the Management System
                Framework Document, and the Occupational Safety and Emergency
                Management TOP Regulations List. However, the Board notes these
                documents do not establish the expected process for determining
                specific legal requirements that apply to the EM Program, and do
                not compile a complete list of regulatory requirements for the
                EM Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                While TransCanada demonstrated that it is tracking, listing and
                conducting internal notifications regarding some regulatory
                changes, it did not demonstrate that it maintains a complete
                list of legal requirements or an effective process to ensure
                that regulatory changes trigger either program changes or
                communication to all staff involved in the EM Program. As a
                result, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element.

                and activities (i.e., construction, operation and maintenance).
                The company’s process for setting objectives and specific

                Audit activities verified that TransCanada has developed and
                implemented an internal program for the establishment and
                management of corporate commitments and priorities with respect
                to the EM program and HS&amp;E management in general. The Board
                was also able to determine that TransCanada has implemented
                documented processes for communicating and monitoring the
                requirements derived from the commitments and priorities its
                program establishes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified that TransCanada uses multiple and varied
                terminology to describe compliance with the Board’s requirements
                relating to Goals, Objectives and Targets (GOT). While there was
                some consistency demonstrated by TransCanada with respect to its
                Peak Performance program, there was a lack of consistency in
                describing TransCanada’s specific HS&amp;E or EM Program GOT.
                During interviews at the management level, TransCanada staff
                articulated multiple terms interchangeably in their description
                of these GOT. Consequently, during the audit, and in order to
                advance the Board’s assessment of this sub-element, Board
                auditors requested clarification from TransCanada via a table of
                concordance to confirm the appropriate linkages between
                TransCanada’s varied internal terminology and the regulatory
                requirements. The Board did not find the materials provided by
                TransCanada as adequately constituting the table of concordance
                requested.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding, the Board reviewed applicable emergency
                management documentation to determine the collective GOT for the
                EM Program. TransCanada provided a concordance table specific to
                the EM Program and which referred to the TransCanada emergency
                response plan Section&nbsp;2.9 table for GOT; however this table
                does not set out the overall GOT for the EM Program. The Board
                further examined the process at the HS&amp;E&nbsp;Management
                System level, as well as the EM Program level. TransCanada’s
                process for establishing, communicating, monitoring and review
                of the GOT for the HS&amp;E Management System is describe under
                Element&nbsp;3 of the HS&amp;E Management System Framework.
                These GOT relate to the HS&amp;E Management System overall and
                do not provide GOT specific to the EM Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also examined many processes at the EM Program level
                however these processes did not set out the overall GOT for the
                EM program. For the EM Program, TransCanada has established a
                series of service standards and training/testing requirements.
                For example, during interviews TransCanada staff described the
                GOT under the EM Program, these include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>field exercise once per year per operational region;</li>
                <li>table top exercise once per year per area;</li>
                <li>review and update emergency response plans annually;</li>
                <li>
                  review and update the Command Post Kits twice per year; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  annual mail out of information letter to response agencies.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These activities are tracked through the IIT system and by work
                order in the Avantis system and are reported to the NEB annually
                as part of its EM&nbsp;Program performance measures. Document
                review confirmed that TransCanada has also incorporated
                measureable standards into its response procedures. For example,
                the Oil Pipeline Leak Detection System Alarm Procedure and Leak
                Alarm Analysis Flowchart documents confirm that TransCanada has
                established some response parameters including a maximum of
                10-minutes to shut-down an oil pipeline after an alarm is
                received. TransCanada did not demonstrate that it had documented
                process which included similar response standards for its gas
                pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada demonstrated that it is
                establishing and tracking aspects of its EM performance
                specifically related to training and the testing of equipment.
                However, the Board was not provided with a documented process
                for development, implementation, maintenance and review of the
                adequacy and effectiveness of GOT for the EM Program. Also while
                performance measures and targets exist for exercises and
                training, TransCanada has not established GOT for other EM
                Program components such as consultation/continuing education and
                liaison with response agencies, response times and
                communications with stakeholders and the public. Based on all
                the foregoing, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant
                with this sub-element.

                TransCanada’s health safety and environment governance structure
                is outlined in its HS&amp;E Management System documentation.
                This governance structure includes TransCanada’s HS&amp;E
                Committee of the Board that monitors practices and procedures,
                considers implementation and effectiveness, and makes
                recommendations to its Board on policies and procedures. The
                HS&amp;E Committee meets monthly, validates HS&amp;E performance
                and goals, reviews both incidents and incident trends. The
                HS&amp;E MS Responsibility Matrix sets out responsibilities and
                accountabilities for the HS&amp;E Management System for all
                employees. During interviews, TransCanada presented the lines of
                responsibility for the EM Program, which indicated that the
                Corporate EM Team reports to Directors and to the HS&amp;E
                Committee of the Board.

                TransCanada divides its Canadian facilities and assets into five
                operational regions. These regions are the Wildrose Region,
                Rocky Mountain Region, Central Region, Northern Ontario Region
                and Eastern Region. Each of these regions has a regional office,
                and area offices also exist where required. TransCanada uses a
                team approach to develop and implement the EM Program. The
                Emergency Management Team (EMT) comprised of emergency
                management technical specialists, is responsible for program
                development and maintenance, emergency management criteria,
                response structure, and protocols. The EMT is also responsible
                for EM Programs for all TransCanada corporate entities and
                business areas and operates from head office. The Emergency
                Preparedness Coordinators (EPC) implement the EM Program in each
                of the five operational regions. The EPCs collectively form the
                emergency preparedness team (EPT) and meet on a quarterly basis
                to review and evaluate the EM Program and activities and to plan
                for events such as exercises and engagement activities. Each
                regional area has an emergency preparedness team member.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the event of an emergency, the TransCanada and Keystone
                emergency response plans set out the emergency response
                structure that follows the Incident Command System (ICS) which
                TransCanada adopted and implemented over the last
                four&nbsp;years. The ICS response structure works across the
                organization, from on-site Command Post to regional emergency
                operations centre (EOC), Corporate EOC (Calgary) and Houston
                EOC. The ICS&nbsp;response structure can invoke Unified Command
                which includes other agencies in the command structure, and this
                process has been tested in exercises. Training modules and
                exercises have tested the response structure across the
                organizational lines. The TransCanada and Keystone ERPs, as well
                as site specific ERPs incorporate the ICS structure. This
                structure includes defined roles for employees that may be
                involved in an emergency on the TransCanada systems. For
                employees identified as part of the emergency response, the
                required training is included in their role profiles.

              <p>
                With respect to the evaluation of need of resources for the EM
                Program, the Board places value on a company’s management of
                availability of external resources that are accessible during an
                emergency. In the Board’s view, for the EM Program, contract
                personnel and equipment play a crucial role in a company’s
                ability to respond effectively to a given emergency. Therefore,
                the Board has determined that the ability to determine the
                amount of resources available is directly applicable to the
                company’s ability to manage and mitigate conditions during an
                emergency that could adversely affect property, the environment
                or the safety of workers or the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada demonstrated that it has
                implemented measures for testing the availability of its
                external resources during an exercise. For example, TransCanada
                staff in the Central Region spot check their contractor’s
                capacity to furnish adequate resources by requesting them from
                the contractor on the days of exercises, without providing the
                contractor prior notice. An exercise conducted for the Keystone
                Pipeline demonstrated that on the date of the exercise, within
                24&nbsp;hours of TransCanada’s request, there could be
                40&nbsp;contract staff and the required equipment on a given
                site. While the Board views this to be good practice conducted
                by regional staff, TransCanada did not demonstrate that this
                type of practice is based on, or linked to, a documented process
                that is applied in all regions.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that it has a documented
                organizational structure for its EM Program and that its
                pre-qualification process formally acquires assurance from its
                emergency management contractor that it is able to meet
                TransCanada’s resource needs. However, the limited testing of
                these assurances in the Central Region only does not adequately
                demonstrate to the Board that TransCanada’s external human
                resources are sufficiently allocated across its system such that
                they will ensure adequate response to a worse case incident. As
                such, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this

              <p>
                Emergency management programs are established and implemented to
                address upset or abnormal operating conditions, accidental
                releases, incidents and emergency situations. Notwithstanding,
                the Board expects companies to have preparatory processes in
                place that function during normal operating conditions to
                develop and maintain effective emergency management programs,
                and implement continual improvement initiatives. The assessment
                of these preparatory processes and preparedness related controls
                follows.

                TransCanada’s HS&amp;E Management System, Element&nbsp;2: Risk
                and Regulatory Assessment describes the processes in place to
                anticipate, identify and evaluate HS&amp;E risks and regulatory
                requirements, prioritize risks and regulatory requirements,
                mitigate exposures and provide direction in the event of an
                incident. During the audit, TransCanada demonstrated that it has
                an effective process in place for developing and implementing
                corrective, mitigative, preventive and protective controls
                associated with the identified hazards and risks. The controls
                include, among others, emergency response procedures, exercise
                programs, continuing education, liaison and outreach activities
                with response agencies, landowners and the public, mutual aid
                agreements, contracts with response providers, emergency
                management training programs, inspections and maintenance of
                emergency management equipment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although not directly included in the scope of this audit,
                TransCanada’s process for managing and overseeing its
                contractors for the EM Program was included in the evaluation of
                the overall EM Program implementation only as far as it impacts
                TransCanada’s ability to respond to an emergency event. In
                addition to pre-qualifying contractors through its contractor
                service provider, IS Networld, TransCanada implements a
                stringent internal procurement and review process. Emergency
                Management contractors are required to comply with TransCanada
                safety practices and procedures. This procurement process is
                managed by the TransCanada Supply Team and oversight of
                contractors is managed by TransCanada’s Regional Offices. As
                part of the process, TransCanada reviews its contractor’s
                procedures to verify they meet TransCanada’s established
                requirements. Contractors are observed and evaluated during
                exercises. Performance is assessed for compliance with
                TransCanada requirements, issues are entered and ranked in IIT
                and evaluation of contractor performance is tracked. Where
                performance does not meet TransCanada requirements, corrective
                actions are required by the contractor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board determined that, in accordance with its expectations,
                TransCanada communicates controls to staff as well as external
                stakeholders who may be exposed to risks, through emergency
                management messaging distributed under its public awareness
                program. Messaging includes content in relation to safety,
                hazards associated with the TransCanada system, emergency
                situations, what to do in the event of an emergency, respective
                roles during an emergency, emergency response procedures, and
                contact information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided by TransCanada during the
                audit, the Board did not identify any non-compliances with
                TransCanada’s processes for developing and implementing
                corrective, mitigative, preventive and protective controls
                associated with the hazards and risks of its operations.
                Accordingly, the Board views these processes to meet its
                expectations, and as a result finds TransCanada to be Compliant
                with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the corrective actions implemented by
                TransCanada to address findings in sub-elements&nbsp;2.1
                and&nbsp;2.2 will trigger the updating of the operational
                controls discussed in this section to introduce appropriate
                controls for any newly identified hazards, risks and legal
                requirements.

              <p><strong>Finding:</strong></p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that TransCanada’s ERP outlines its plans and
                procedures for identifying the potential for upset or abnormal
                operating conditions, accidental releases, incidents and
                emergency situations. TransCanada has established and
                implemented the overarching TransCanada and Keystone ERPs, and
                developed site specific ERPs to account for the unique
                circumstances of each of its above ground facilities including
                compressor stations and pump stations. As well, TransCanada has
                identified 48&nbsp;sites along the Keystone Pipeline route as
                Highly Sensitive Receptors (HSR) as they are areas where unique
                hazards must be incorporated into a response plan. Therefore,
                these sites meet TransCanada’s criteria for further analysis and
                development of site specific Tactical Response Plans (TRP).
                According to TransCanada policy, TRPs are to be developed and
                implemented for all HSR along the Keystone pipeline. The Board
                notes that at the time of the audit, 12 of the 48 TRP were still
                under development by TransCanada who indicated that it had not
                had sufficient time to complete all TRP from the time the TRP
                had been identified through the hazard identification and risk
                assessment study completed in January&nbsp;2013, to the start of
                the NEB audit. TransCanada stated that, although the TRP were
                still in development, the Keystone ERP was fully in effect, and
                would provide for an effective response to an incident anywhere
                on the Keystone system, regardless of the development of a
                site-specific TRP. While the Board notes that TransCanada’s
                standard response procedures should allow for response to an
                incident; the Board is of the view that the TRPs provide for a
                more timely and planned response for the sensitive areas.
                Therefore the Board requires that TransCanada complete the
                implementation of its Keystone ERP submitted and develop all
                required TRP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another method that TransCanada uses to identify potential
                circumstances for upset or abnormal conditions and develop and
                improve contingency plans is by conducting exercises. According
                to the TransCanada ERP, TransCanada conducts both table-top and
                full scale field exercises to test its plans, procedures and
                ERPs on an annual basis to ensure ongoing suitability and
                identify opportunities for improvement. Field exercises also
                provide a training opportunity for employees with emergency
                management roles, first response agencies, response partners and
                contractors.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada manages all records generated as a result of field
                exercises through the IIT process. The IIT process tracks any
                actions assigned to TransCanada staff based on learnings until
                the actions are resolved. Record review determined that
                TransCanada undertakes follow-up actions on items resulting from
                internal feedback on its exercises. However, record review
                indicated that feedback received from some external agencies,
                stakeholders or other field exercise participants was not
                included or tracked by TransCanada. For instance, review of
                feedback from the paramedics that were present at an exercise
                indicated that not all paramedics were familiar with their roles
                during a TransCanada exercise and may not necessarily understand
                the ICS structure or the dangers of an incident. At the time of
                the audit, the Board did not observe any action items in IIT
                that related to this issue or any other feedback from external
                participants. The Board further noted there is feedback from
                fire departments listed in the exercise summaries but their
                concerns and feedback were not transferred or included in the
                IIT action list for follow-up by TransCanada. Also,
                TransCanada’s Summary of Learnings from an exercise indicated
                that the first responders did not fully understand the hazards
                that were present and this should be explored. While the Board
                understands the IIT process to be an effective tool for
                TransCanada to capture the lessons learned and to manage
                follow-up actions required to address participant feedback, it
                noted that TransCanada’s IIT records did not include all action
                items triggered by feedback from the external participants in
                the field and table top exercises. The Board considers this gap
                to be significant given the important role of external agencies
                and the impact their feedback could have on the ongoing
                preparation of responders for an emergency event.
              </p>
              <p>
                In evaluating TransCanada’s compliance for this sub-element, the
                Board notes TransCanada has developed processes and plans to
                identify the potential for upset or abnormal conditions as well
                as methods to test the adequacy of its contingency plans.
                However, at the time of the audit, these processes and plans
                were not, in the Board’s view fully implemented or effective to
                meet the Board’s expectations. Accordingly, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.

              <p>
                In conducting its assessment of this sub-element, the Board
                considered the MOC process first as it integrates the EM program
                and more broadly, as it applies to the HS&amp;E Management
                System that incorporates the EM program.
              </p>
              <p><em>EM Program MOC</em></p>
              <p>
                The Board reviewed several documented procedures and records
                related to MOC for the EM Program including the Management of
                Change form (MOC form) and the TransCanada Operating Procedure
                Management of Change Report (MOC report). These are two
                integrated procedures that establish the process to identify a
                proposed change, identify the stakeholders involved, the steps
                to implement the change and target implementation dates. The
                sample MOC forms completed for pipe integrity reviewed by the
                Board included changes that would have an effect on emergency
                response planning. However, following implementation of these
                changes, the list of TOP updates reviewed by the Board did not
                demonstrate updates being made to EM procedures or response
                plans, thereby reflecting the change being implemented in the EM
                Program.
              </p>
              <p><em>HS&amp;E Management System MOC</em></p>
              <p>
                At the time of the audit, TransCanada identified that it had
                developed and implemented two separate MOC processes to manage
                and document changes that incorporate its EM Program. The first
                process was developed and implemented as part of its Integrity
                Management Program, and is captured in the MOC form (Integrity
                MOC). This Integrity MOC is asset based and therefore is
                triggered by changes to equipment or software. Changes are
                described and tracked using a standardized form that documents
                both description of the rationale for the change being managed,
                as well as internal and external stakeholder notifications that
                need to be considered under its process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second process used to manage changes in its protection
                programs leverages some of the functionality of the TOP database
                and the TOPs Framework Process. The TOP database contains the
                operating procedures and some related documents for each of the
                protection programs. The TransCanada ERP is considered a TOP
                internally, and as is therefore managed by this process.
              </p>
              <p>
                As per the TOP Framework Process, when the TransCanada ERP owner
                modifies the Manual and reloads it into the database, the TOP
                database automatically notifies a list of pre-identified
                internal stakeholders of the new version of the document in
                order to systematically solicit comments on the changes.
                Further, once changes have been finalized, the TOP management
                process automatically disseminates a monthly report for all
                employees outlining the TOP that have been modified during the
                previous period.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada staff indicted that these two processes ensures that
                changes to procedures are managed and communicated throughout
                its organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that these processes do not include steps to
                proactively identify change that could affect safety, security
                or the protection of the environment. The Board has determined
                that by using the Integrity MOC and TOP framework processes,
                TransCanada has operationalized some aspects necessary for an
                MOC process by documenting and communicating of some types of
                change through document versioning, however, these processes are
                not adequate either separately or in combination to satisfy the
                OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                In considering the MOC process as it integrates the HS&amp;E
                Management System, during the audit, TransCanada staff indicated
                that, while the company considers its presently implemented MOC
                processes to be compliant with the Board’s requirements, it has
                a project underway to implement an overarching and singular MOC
                process which will better meet the Board’s requirements. This
                new MOC process is scheduled to be fully implemented by the
                end&nbsp;2014. TransCanada staff provided an overview
                presentation of the new MOC. Initial review indicates that it
                could potentially address the OPR requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                During interviews TransCanada indicated that it has developed
                the new MOC as the result of a corrective action arising from an
                internal audit completed in&nbsp;2009. While the Board
                acknowledges the improvements that the new process could
                represent, the Board notes that TransCanada’s
                2014&nbsp;implementation date is approximately five&nbsp;years
                from identification through to correction. The Board has found
                it appropriate to address this issue in its evaluation of
                sub-elements&nbsp;4.3 Internal Audits and&nbsp;5.0 Management
                Review.
              </p>
              <p>
                While TransCanada has implemented some aspects of an MOC
                process, at the time of the audit, TransCanada did not
                demonstrate that it has an established and implemented a process
                for identifying and managing change that could affect safety,
                security or protection of the environment, including new hazards
                or risks, changes in design, specifications, standards or
                procedures, and change in the company’s organizational structure
                or the legal requirements. As a result, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the corrective actions implemented by
                TransCanada to address findings in sub-elements&nbsp;2.1

                During the audit, TransCanada demonstrated how it assigns,
                tracks and manages the training for staff involved in emergency
                response by utilizing its internal Learning Management System
                (LMS). Through the LMS, employees throughout the organization
                are notified when they are due to take or refresh training. In
                order to ensure that training is current and monitored, managers
                are also notified if any of their staff’s training has expired.
              </p>
              <p>
                With respect to the EM Program, TransCanada demonstrated an
                effective process for developing competency requirements and
                training programs that provide employees and other persons
                working with or on behalf of the company with the training
                required for emergency response roles. For internal training,
                TransCanada developed documented emergency management role
                training profiles and competency requirements for each role in
                the EM Program. There are requirements for regional and
                corporate employees with a potential EM role to complete
                emergency training modules as set out in the emergency
                management role training profiles. Having all the required
                training is a key performance indicator in each employees
                documented annual performance agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Training is provided in both classroom and on-line modules, and
                employees must pass a written exam for certain modules in order
                to determine competency requirements. Emergency management
                training also includes participation in table top, equipment
                deployment and field (full scale) exercises to test competency
                in designated ICS role(s). Internal feedback from exercises,
                incidents or issues is captured by IIT and can result in changes
                or updates to exercise program and training requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada also provides training to external parties through
                its full scale and table top exercise program. Annual field
                exercises include the participation of the local response
                agencies such as fire departments, police, EMS and other
                municipal emergency services. The Board observed TransCanada
                employees and other response agencies in their ICS roles during
                two field exercises, and no concerns were noted regarding the
                overall implementation of ICS structure. The Board did note in
                reviewing the feedback from exercises that feedback from these
                external parties regarding their roles in the exercises was not
                being tracked and evaluated through TransCanada’s IIT process.
                The Board is of the view however that this issue relates to
                TransCanada’s process to develop, revise and improve its
                contingency plans, and has addressed it in sub-element&nbsp;3.2
                Operational Control-Upset or Abnormal Operating Conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided by TransCanada during the
                audit, the Board did not identify any non-compliances with
                TransCanada’s processes for establishing and implementing
                effective processes for developing competency requirements and
                training programs. Accordingly, the Board finds TransCanada to
                be Compliant with its expectations for this sub-element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes the corrective actions implemented by
                TransCanada to address findings in sub-elements&nbsp;2.1 2.2,
                2.4 and&nbsp;3.2 of this report may trigger the updating of the
                training program to address any newly identified legal
                requirement, hazards and deficiencies noted by external parties
                regarding contingency plans.

              <p>
                TransCanada’s EM Program has implemented an external
                communication plan directed at its external stakeholders,
                including first responders and adjacent landowners. TransCanada
                has integrated some of the outreach components of its EM Program
                with its Public Awareness program for the purposes of
                communication, consultation, and liaison with, first response
                agencies such as fire departments, police, emergency medical
                services, and other municipal emergency services that may have a
                response role in the event of a TransCanada pipeline incident.
                These programs are also integrated for the purpose of providing
                baseline emergency response messaging and safety information to
                landowners and the public that may be involved in an emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s Pipeline Public Awareness Program Manual (PA
                Manual) indicates that public awareness applies to all pipeline
                assets in Canada, and reaches emergency official and local
                public officials. The Public Awareness program maintains contact
                with affected public, emergency and public officials and
                stakeholders who may interact with TransCanada or who are
                directly impacted. The PA Manual sets out the process for
                baseline messaging and annual mail-out to emergency agencies in
                Canada, the US and Mexico. Supplemental information can be
                provided where requested. The PA Manual also includes baseline
                messages for Emergency Officials and supplemental safety and
                emergency information that can be provided on request.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of its plan, TransCanada also provides an annual letter
                and information package that describes the TransCanada emergency
                response program, planning, roles, hazards, contact information,
                and response procedures and roles to all response agencies along
                its pipeline systems. The information package includes a
                Material Safety Data Sheet for either sweet natural gas, or oil
                in the case of the Keystone pipeline. The Emergency Services
                Guide is provided to all response agencies and describes what to
                do in the event of a pipeline emergency. The TransCanada
                Emergency Response Guide for Natural Gas provides detailed
                information to response agencies. An annual mail-out also seeks
                to confirm agency contact information as well as the services
                that can be provided by the agency. Where no response from an
                agency is received by TransCanada, it attempts to make telephone
                contact with the agency. Where requested by an agency,
                TransCanada will meet or give a presentation on the TransCanada
                EM&nbsp;Program. TransCanada has also produced a video that
                details the TransCanada emergency management system, the hazards
                associated with the pipelines, respective roles during an
                emergency, the response structure and contact information. The
                video is provided to agencies upon request. As part of the
                continuing education program, agencies are also invited to
                participate in the annual field exercise conducted in each of
                TransCanada’s operational regions. The Board observed that all
                regions followed procedures for annual mail outs, follow-up
                contact and presentations to agencies, and for participation in
                field exercises. During the audit, TransCanada demonstrated that
                its regional offices were testing various methods looking to
                increase engagement and response from responding agencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regarding external communication aimed specifically at the
                public and landowners, interviews and document review confirmed
                that TransCanada’s EM Program includes the annual delivery of an
                emergency management information package that includes a
                calendar containing comprehensive emergency information
                including emergency contacts and phone numbers, and emergency
                management information brochures in French and English. The
                Board also notes that each of the five operational regions
                develops an Annual Public Awareness Detailed Plans and
                Integrated Public Awareness Regional Plans that lists outreach
                activities, resources, stakeholders, locations, status and
                responsibilities to be addressed as part of its continuing
                education program for emergency response.

              <p>
                TransCanada uses several methods communicate emergency
                management information across its organization. The emergency
                management group holds monthly and quarterly meetings that
                include the EMT, regional EPCs and emergency management team
                members. Changes, staff feedback, reviews and updates to both
                the program and the EM Manual are managed through the TOPs
                document management framework. Findings from inspections and
                audits of the EM Program, learnings from emergency management
                exercises and related issues are communicated, tracked and
                resolved through the IIT Process.

                As noted previously, in order to manage and control its over
                200&nbsp;hundred procedures and their related operational
                documents, TransCanada has developed and implemented the TOP
                Program. The TOP Program Owner is the Vice President of
                Engineering and Asset Reliability. TransCanada has outlined the
                TOP Program in a framework document (TOP Framework), and 
                according to it , the objective TOP Program is to create a
                framework for the development and maintenance of the
                documentation necessary for TransCanada employees and
                contractors to efficiently and correctly conduct the operational
                and maintenance activities associated with TransCanada’s
                facilities. This document also clarifies the applicability of
                the TOP Program to all operating procedures when they are being
                created, revised, reviewed or retired.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has also developed and implemented a database to
                house all of the TOPs documents. Available to staff at all
                locations through the corporate Intranet, the TOPs database has
                the functionality to generate a monthly report to track and
                alert internal stakeholders to any updates to TOPs and produces
                a monthly report listing the TOPs that have been updated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified that the TOP Framework provides for

                demonstrated the annual maintenance of emergency response plans
                and other emergency management system documents and elements.
                Records are controlled using its electronic data management
                system. The Board also observed the detailed records kept during
                the field exercises as well as EOC exercise documents and action
                plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided during the audit, the Board
                did not identify any non-compliances with TransCanada’s process
                relating to establishing and implementing effective processes
                for identifying and managing documents. Accordingly, the Board
                views these processes as being meeting its expectations, and
                finds TransCanada to be Compliant with this sub-element.

                During interviews, TransCanada indicated that it has established
                and implemented several processes for inspecting and monitoring
                its equipment, activities and emergency response plans related
                to its EM Program. Tier&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 planned inspections 
                are scheduled using Avantis Work Orders for  the review of
                TransCanada’s EM Program equipment and activities, to be
                conducted monthly (M1), every three months (M3), every six
                months (M6) and annually (M12). These inspections include
                verification of the maintenance of the regional emergency
                operations centre kit (M6), emergency command post kits (M6),
                TransCanada, Keystone and site specific emergency response plans
                (M12), table top emergency response exercises (M12), equipment
                deployment exercises (M12), external field exercises (M12),
                corporate exercises (M24). Further, equipment inspections are
                also managed and assigned through the Avantis system, and
                include scheduled inspections for all five emergency trailers
                located in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.
              </p>

                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that it uses several methods
                to monitor and measure the performance of its EM Program. It
                also demonstrated that the records of the inspections are
                captured and maintained in its Electronic Document Management
                System (EDMS). In addition to the annual performance measures
                established by TransCanada for its EM Program, the actions
                resulting from the Tier&nbsp;1, 2, 3 and&nbsp;4 inspections and
                audits are captured in scorecards and the IIT system to track
                their management and resolution. The scorecards are reported to
                program management, senior management and through the annual
                management review process, to executive leadership.

                Based on the information provided during the audit, the Board
                did not identify any non-compliances with TransCanada’s process
                relating to inspecting and monitoring its activities and
                facilities and for evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of
                its EM Program. Accordingly, the Board views these processes to
                meet its expectations, and finds TransCanada to be Compliant

              <p>
                TransCanada has implemented an internal web-based Incident
                Management System (IMS) as a tool for incident notification,
                response, investigation, documentation, follow-up and sharing of
                information. The IMS includes links to the EM Program and to
                incident investigation processes, checklists, policies, guides,
                tools and regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                An integral component of the IMS is the IIT system, which is an
                internal web-based electronic database tool available to
                TransCanada employees that tracks internal and external
                compliance, reporting of incidents and near misses, and
                corrective actions. It is used to implement actions to address
                hazards and risks and features two types of notifications that
                are sent to pre-determined notification profiles (e-mail
                distribution lists). The profiles are for event notifications
                (incidents, issues) and action notifications sent to accountable
                parties. The IIT generates reports on incidents, events and
                causes, and can search events by categories including:
                classification counts (incidents by classification) spills, gas
                releases, hazard analysis and controls, and abnormal operations.
                A training module for IIT is presented to employees as part of
                the Learning Management System. EM Program activities such as
                field and table top exercises are also tracked through the IIT
                system. The lessons learned and follow-up actions from these
                activities are generated from IIT. The Board also noted
                TransCanada’s established and implemented procedures for
                external reporting of incidents in accordance with regulatory
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its process for
                reporting on hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                near-misses, and for taking corrective and preventive actions
                with respect to the EM Program, was effective to meet the
                Board’s expectations. Accordingly, the Board did not identify
                any non-compliances with TransCanada’s process and finds
                TransCanada to be Compliant with this sub-element.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall have an
                established, implemented and effective quality assurance program
                for its management system and for each protection program,
                including a process for conducting regular inspections and
                audits and for taking corrective and preventive actions if
                deficiencies are identified. The audit process should identify
                and manage the training and competency requirements for staff
                carrying out the audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company should integrate the results of its audits with

                Review of the documentation and records provided by TransCanada
                demonstrated that it has established and implemented an audit
                program to assess its management programs and provide quality
                assurance of same. This multi-level approach consists of:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tier&nbsp;1 - Conformance reviews;</li>
                <li>Tier&nbsp;2 - Inspections: Planned inspections;</li>
                <li>
                  Tier&nbsp;3 - Internal system audits and targeted audits
                  focused on maintenance and equipment suitability; and
                </li>
                <li>Tier&nbsp;4 - External audits and assessments.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Records provided by TransCanada during the audit demonstrated
                that the audit program is presently being implemented at a
                frequency exceeding the OPR requirements to audit on a maximum
                three-year&nbsp;interval. Review of TransCanada’s audit program
                documentation and records of audits indicated that TransCanada’s
                audits are not meeting the requirements for audits outlined in
                OPR section&nbsp;53. Specifically, TransCanada could not
                demonstrate that the audits are being conducted to ensure that
                their pipelines are designed, constructed, operated and
                abandoned in compliance with the legal requirements outlined in
                that section. Review of the internal audit standard and audit
                specific internal audit protocols and records indicated that
                TransCanada focuses almost exclusively on evaluating the
                implementation of its existing programs, procedures and
                practices, as designed, as opposed to statutory compliance.
                TransCanada did provide records indicating that some of the
                content was covered during the external audit processes
                (Tier&nbsp;4); however, TransCanada was unable to provide
                appropriate records of the external audit protocols or working
                files. As a result, it could not clearly demonstrate the content
                and extent of the review. Further, review of records outlining
                the direction provided by TransCanada to its external auditors
                outlined a focus on conformance to internal requirements or
                conformance to external ISO standards. While the Board
                encourages the practice of comparing performance relative to
                international standards in order to improve audit programs,
                conformance to internal procedures and external ISO standards
                alone is not sufficient for a quality assurance program because
                it does not include all relevant legal requirements. Without an
                evaluation of compliance to its legal requirements, TransCanada
                has not established an audit program that can determine the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has also established and implemented a process for
                developing and implementing corrective and preventive actions if
                deficiencies are noted during Tier&nbsp;3 audits. This process
                utilizes its IIT database for assignment, tracking and closeout
                for all internal audit findings that have associated corrective
                or preventative actions identified.
              </p>
              <p>
                Findings from the Tier&nbsp;4, third party audits are discussed,
                prioritized and managed at the senior management level. However,
                the Board noted deficiencies in relation to quality assurance
                and corrective and preventive actions. The Board was unable to
                view, as part of a process, how TransCanada and its management
                consistently evaluated and prioritized the findings,
                recommendations and the development of preventive and corrective
                actions resulting from the internal and external audits. While
                management must have some latitude to manage the results of
                findings, there must be proceduralized guidelines to consider
                and prioritize the findings to ensure timely statutory
                compliance and the safety of public, workers and the
                environment. The Board was unable to find clear direction to
                guide managers during the development of corrective and
                preventive action plans provided within the processes reviewed.
                This may have contributed to unacceptable implementation periods
                for some of the identified deficiencies contained within the
                audit documents provided by TransCanada. For example,
                TransCanada’s 2009 audit identified the need to develop and
                implement an MOC process across the company. During the Board’s
                2013 audit (this audit) it was noted that the MOC process would
                not be fully implemented until after the beginning of&nbsp;2014.
                This is a lag period of at least 5&nbsp;years from
                identification through to correction. The Board clearly
                described its MOC requirements in its 2009 Audit Protocol. The
                Board is of the view that all findings related to compliance
                must be acted on in a timely manner by companies regardless of
                the internal evaluation of risk. As another example, the Board
                notes that one of the internal third party audits provided
                recommendations to management that they conduct third party
                audits of the internal programs to measure compliance. This
                recommendation is consistent with the Board’s findings in this
                audit; however, as per records provided during the audit,
                TransCanada management decided not to act on the recommendation.
                Regardless of the third party audit recommendation to implement
                another third party review of compliance, an issue relating to
                compliance or assurance of compliance was identified during the
                audit. Review of TransCanada’s internal audit processes
                indicated that there are no clear requirements to act on known
                or potential non-compliance findings during the management
                review of the audit results. This particular example could have
                led to compliant findings being made in other sub-elements in
                the Board’s audit if TransCanada had acted on the
                recommendation.
              </p>
              <p>
                While TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its quality
                assurance program is implemented on a scale that exceeds the
                Board’s expectations with respect to frequency, the audits
                focused on conformance to internal requirements rather than
                compliance with statutory requirements. There was also a lack of
                guidance to enable senior management to prioritize and manage
                corrective and preventive actions for deficiencies identified in
                audits. This sub-element has therefore been found by the Board
                to be Non-Compliant.

              <p>
                TransCanada has established a Business Information Management
                Program to manage the records that are generated either in
                support of, or by, its operational activities. The Records
                Classification System and Records Retention Schedule have been
                developed to address regulatory and business information
                retention requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the document review and site visits, the Board observed
                the Electronic Data Management System that TransCanada has
                implemented to manage its EM Program related records. This
                system adheres to the TransCanada records classification system
                and retention schedule.
              </p>
              <p>
                The records management program includes the management of
                policies, procedures, guidelines, and documents related to
                departmental activities and functions. Document and records
                types include emergency response plans, records of command post
                kits, Tier&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 inspections, site specific plans,
                testing and exercise records, and emergency contact lists.
                Contact information for Emergency Responder agencies along
                TransCanada rights-of-way is managed in the Emergency Responder
                database by TransCanada’s Regional Community Relations
                Representatives. Annual contact with these agencies is done with
                a fax-back form to confirm that TransCanada has the appropriate
                contact information on file. Agencies that do not respond to the
                request for confirmation are contacted by phone to ensure the
                information on file is correct.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided during the audit, the Board
                did not identify any non-compliances with TransCanada’s process
                for effectively generating, retaining, and maintaining records
                that document the implementation of the management system and
                its protection programs, and for providing access to those who
                require them. Accordingly, the Board views this process to meet
                its expectations, and as a result finds TransCanada to be
                Compliant with this sub-element.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall have an
                established, implemented and effective process for conducting an
                annual management review of the management system and each
                protection program and for ensuring continual improvement in

                company employees and the pipeline, and protection of property
                and the environment. The management review should include a

                Interviews with TransCanada staff and review of the supporting
                documentation and records provided by TransCanada indicated that
                the company undertakes a significant amount of work in the
                oversight of its Health, Safety and Environmental programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The HS&amp;E Management System document, dated
                18&nbsp;July&nbsp;2011, provides a high level overview of
                processes for collecting applicable metrics, evaluating the
                HS&amp;E Management System, developing recommendations,
                communicating findings to senior management, and for the
                implementation of program and management system modifications.
                Interviews indicated there are several processes that
                TransCanada utilizes for reviewing safety related performance
                including, a management scorecard, and a process for the review
                of audit findings. Review of the management scorecards indicated
                that they include and monitor a large number of program metrics.
                For emergency management, the annual scorecard is generated by
                the EMT and presented to the Corporate HS&amp;E Committee.
                Review of documents and records indicates that the various
                reviews are being performed on a regular basis at several
                organizational levels within TransCanada, and that the
                information flows vertically and across the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The HS&amp;E Management System document also describes the
                HS&amp;E governance structure for TransCanada. TransCanada’s
                lead governance body in this area is the HS&amp;E Committee of
                the Board of Directors (HS&amp;E Committee), which monitors
                practices and procedures to ensure compliance with legislation,
                conformity with policies, procedures and programs, and the
                prevention and mitigation of losses. The HS&amp;E Committee
                considers the effectiveness of implementation of policies,
                procedures and programs and makes recommendations to the Board
                of Directors as a whole. The HS&amp;E Committee meets separately
                with officers of the company that are responsible for these
                matters and on an annual basis, the HS&amp;E Committee reviews
                its charter and recommends changes to the Governance Committee
                and the Board of Directors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The TransCanada Corporate HS&amp;E Committee is comprised of key
                company leaders representing each functional area within the
                Operations and Engineering sections. The Corporate HS&amp;E
                Committee provides leadership to the HS&amp;E policies, programs
                and procedures. It reviews, approves and monitors performance
                goals and targets, provides critical review of incidents,
                reviews and evaluates incident trends, directs changes in
                response to trends, engages with other companies on best
                practices, facilitates information sharing and learning, and
                provides information to the HS&amp;E Committee of the Board of
                Directors. The Corporate HS&amp;E Committee meets on a monthly
                basis to validate HS&amp;E performance goals and targets,
                monitor performance, remove barriers to HS&amp;E performance and
                to develop recommendations to the HS&amp;E Committee of the
                Board of Directors.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the overall HS&amp;E governance processes,
                TransCanada staff provided an overview and records describing
                the company’s year-end Emergency Preparedness Meetings. These
                are comprehensive three&nbsp;day meetings involving the EMT,
                regional coordinators and team members for the purpose of
                conducting annual reviews of the EM Program. These annual
                reviews consider emergency management training activities, the
                results of exercises, reviews of actual responses to incidents,
                the status of IIT action items, review of the IIT incident trend
                analysis, Emergency Response Plan updates, CEPA initiatives, and
                the results of Tier&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 inspections. The program
                elements are rolled up into the scorecard each month, forwarded
                for management review and an annual scorecard is generated and
                forwarded to the HS&amp;E Management Committee.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reviewing this sub-element, the Board also takes into
                consideration senior management’s involvement and performance in
                those activities which the Board views their active
                participation in to be critical. Specifically these include
                evaluating and managing the results of: internal inspection and
                monitoring programs, investigations of incidents, audits, and
                the results of compliance verification activities conducted by
                regulatory agencies. As noted above, TransCanada’s senior
                management and Board of Directors are significantly involved in
                the direction and review of the company’s HS&amp;E related
                management system programs, including the EM Program. Yet, the
                Board has made findings of non-compliance in other sub-elements
                dealing with the development of the scope of company audits, and
                the development and implementation of Corrective Action Plans,
                which it views to properly fall within the care and control of
                senior management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, while the Board was able to confirm that TransCanada
                is undertaking a significant number of management review
                activities consistent with the descriptions included in the
                HS&amp;E Management System document, TransCanada was not able to
                provide or demonstrate a documented and comprehensive management
                review process of the EM Program that described activities for
                adequately and effectively undertaking its management reviews on
                a consistent basis, and for ensuring its continual improvement
                as the Board expects. As a result of the foregoing, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.

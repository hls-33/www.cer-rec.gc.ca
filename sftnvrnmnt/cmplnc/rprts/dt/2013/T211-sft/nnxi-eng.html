                the identity of the accountable officer within 30&nbsp;days of
                the appointment and ensure that the accountable officer submits

                Following the release of the amended OPR on
                10&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013, the National Energy Board (Board or
                NEB) gave its regulated companies 30&nbsp;days to submit written
                notice of both the identity of their accountable officers and
                the acceptance by these persons of the responsibilities attached
                to this position. On 10&nbsp;May&nbsp;2013, TransCanada
                submitted its written notice to the NEB indicating that its
                Executive Vice President of Operations and Major Projects had
                been appointed as accountable officer for TransCanada and all of
                its subsidiaries. In its submission, TransCanada confirmed that
                its accountable officer has the authority over the human and
                financial resources required to meet the Board’s substantive
                expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that the audit commenced in June&nbsp;2013,which
                was approximately two months after the legal requirement to
                appoint an accountable officer was introduced into the OPR
                (April&nbsp;2013). As a result, this role at TransCanada had
                only been in effect for approximately two months and the
                accountable officer was not able to complete an annual planning
                cycle that would allow for the Board’s evaluation of the
                substantive responsibilities attached to this position. In this
                context, the Board is satisfied in its assessment that
                TransCanada has appointed an accountable officer and outlined
                the responsibilities of this position to the Board in accordance
                with the regulatory requirements and submission deadlines. As a
                result, the Board finds TransCanada’s to be Compliant with the
                requirements associated with this sub-element.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall have documented
                policies and goals intended to ensure activities are conducted

              </p>
              <p>
                The company’s accountable officer shall prepare a policy
                statement that sets out the company’s commitment to these

                regulations and minimize risk to employees, the public and the
                environment. TransCanada demonstrated that the Commitment

                TransCanada has a formal Health, Safety and Environment
                Management System document dated last revision 18 July&nbsp;2011
                that is classified as a Policy and Procedure within their
                document structure. The document provides an outline of the
                Health, Safety and Environmental (HS&amp;E) Management System.

                The scope of the TransCanada HS&amp;E Management System (and
                Policy), as outlined in the Manual, includes all full-time and
                part-time employees, contract workers, independent consultants
                and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and operated entities in
                Canada, United States and Mexico.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the promulgation of the amended OPR, the Board has
                clarified its expectations for management systems including what
                is required content for the policies that govern protection
                programs including Safety Management Programs (SM Program). As
                per the OPR, companies must have policies for the internal
                reporting of hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near
                misses that includes the conditions under which a person who
                makes a report will be granted immunity from disciplinary
                action.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of its demonstration of compliance with respect to the
                above, TransCanada provided its formal Code of Business Ethics
                (COBE) that includes requirements for Leaders to (refer to Page
                of 8 of the COBE) to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  create a safe environment in which individuals are encouraged
                  to speak up if they are aware of or suspect a legal or ethical
                  violation;
                </li>
                <li>
                  accepting reports of violations that individuals may bring to
                  you, and understanding your obligation to report these issues
                  as appropriate to your Compliance Coordinator, the Corporate
                  Compliance Department, Internal Audit, the Harassment
                  Investigation Coordinator or Privacy Officer, or the Ethics
                  Help Line; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  ensuring that your direct reports understand and act in
                  accordance with all legal and ethical requirements that impact
                  them in their jobs, that they know how to report actual or
                  suspected non-compliance with the law or COBE or to ask
                  questions regarding ethical or legal matters, and that they
                  complete all required ethics and compliance-related training.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The COBE, page&nbsp;9, outlines procedures for reporting legal
                and ethical violations, resources available and information
                about the Ethics Help Line. Additionally, the COBE,
                page&nbsp;36, includes content related to Protecting Health and
                Safety and the Environment including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  &quot;Whether you work in a field location or in an office
                  setting, you must always ensure that you comply with all
                  health, safety and environment-related legal requirements, as
                  well as TransCanada’s corporate policies; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  This includes appropriate use of personal protective
                  equipment, not smoking at TransCanada work sites (except in
                  designated smoking areas), completing all health and safety
                  related training, complying with ergonomic practices,
                  preventing environmental leaks and spills, and complying with
                  all reporting obligations to governmental agencies, to name
                  just a few requirements.&quot;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The review of the COBE indicated that it did not meet the
                requirements as it limits the immunity provisions to reporting
                any actual or suspected violation of the law without fear of
                retaliation. TransCanada has also implemented an Incident
                Management Program to manage the reporting of violations,
                hazards and potential hazards that &quot;encourages notification
                of all incidents&quot;. In the Board’s view, these documents do
                not adequately address the OPR requirements because it is not
                explicit in these documents that there is a policy indicating
                that TransCanada staff who reported deficiencies, hazards or
                risks associated with the Safety Program would be protected from
                disciplinary action.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established and implemented
                an HS&amp;E Commitment Statement, an Incident Management Program
                and Code of Business Ethics that include protection of the
                public, workers and the environment and, to certain extent,
                provides for immunity from disciplinary action. Following review
                and consideration, however, for the reasons noted above, the
                Board has determined that these documents do not demonstrate the
                existence of policies that meet the criteria outlined in
                expectations. As a result, the Board has determined that this
                sub-element is Non-Compliant.

              <p>
                TransCanada’s risk assessment and hazard identification process
                is rooted in Element&nbsp;2 of its HS&amp;E Management System:
                Risk and Regulatory Assessment. The process itself is comprised
                of, and enabled by, a number of tools including the HS&amp;E
                Risk Assessment TransCanada Operating Procedure (TOP) and the
                HS&amp;E Risk Registry.
              </p>
              <p>
                The HS&amp;E Risk Assessment TOP applies to the identification
                and assessment of all hazards and risks associated with
                TransCanada’s operations in North America, and establishes the
                conditions that trigger a risk assessment. These triggers
                include: a significant incident or trend of similar incidents; a
                change in regulatory requirement or social condition; need
                identified through an audit, or, in the absence of these, the
                elapsing of 12&nbsp;months since the last risk assessment. The
                HS&amp;E Risk Assessment TOP requires that a risk assessment be
                conducted that will result in an HS&amp;E Risk Registry and that
                will facilitate the proactive selection and implementation of
                controls to eliminate or mitigate identified or potential risks.
                The HS&amp;E Risk Registry is a hierarchical inventory of the
                identified health safety and environmental risks at an
                organizational level at TransCanada, and includes regulatory,
                operational and line of business risk.

                TransCanada has a Health, Safety and Environment Risk Assessment
                procedure for semi-quantitative methodology for identifying,
                assessing and prioritizing HS&amp;E Risks associated with
                TransCanada’s business. The procedure includes the development
                of a registry or inventory of HS&amp;E Risks and the
                identification of controls to eliminate or mitigate identified
                and/or potential HS&amp;E Risks and includes a process for
                evaluating the risks associated with the identified hazards. The
                procedure assigns responsibilities/accountabilities to various
                Directors and/or Managers (i.e.&nbsp;CS&amp;E, Business Unit,
                Compliance etc.) and the HS&amp;E Risk Assessment Working Team.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s risk registers have been initiated but not
                completed for all of TransCanada’s facilities. As well, sampling
                of the JSA and Pre-job Planning processes was performed at
                various locations during the audit field activities. Some minor
                errors were identified on two sampled JSAs at the Burstall
                compressor station; however, this does not appear to be systemic
                in nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board finds that TransCanada was not able to demonstrate
                records of an implemented and effective process for identifying
                and analyzing all hazards, establishing and maintaining an
                inventory of hazards and potential hazards, and evaluating the
                risks including normal and abnormal operating conditions. In
                addition to the above regulatory reference for the OPR, this is
                also a non-compliance to the
                <em>Canada Labour Code</em> Part&nbsp;II, PART&nbsp;XIX Hazard
                Prevention Program, sections&nbsp;19.4 and&nbsp;19.5.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was also identified that TransCanada has a formalized
                electronic system called IIT (Incident Issue Tracking) that
                allows any TransCanada personnel to enter hazards, potential
                hazards, incidents and near-misses and for taking corrective and
                preventive actions, including the steps to manage imminent
                hazards. The IIT system allows for the monitoring and analysis
                of trends in hazards, incidents and near-misses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The IIT program was demonstrated by TransCanada personnel. The
                Board reviewed several incident investigation reports that
                included, among other subjects, a deer strike, vehicle
                backing-up incidents and a valve failure. The investigation
                reports include a description of the incident, causation, action
                items, responsibilities and tracking mechanism. There were no
                identified issues with the investigation reports sampled.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has a documented Harassment-Free Workplace Policy
                with an effective date 26&nbsp;July&nbsp;20 10. This policy was
                observed posted at several TransCanada inspected locations and
                applies to all personnel (including full-time and part-time
                employees, contract workers, contractors and independent
                consultants) of TransCanada. The policy comprehensively
                describes the harassment policy and company requirements with
                respect to complaints, confidentiality, retaliation, immediate
                actions to take, responsibilities, resolution process,
                definitions and compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has a number of mechanisms to communicate controls
                to employees and contractors including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  a formal LMS (Learning Management System) that outlines
                  training requirements and tracks training;
                </li>
                <li>job-site orientations;</li>
                <li>job safety analyses; and</li>
                <li>pre-job.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Although TransCanada demonstrated that it has established and
                implemented a SM Program that incorporates several processes for
                the identification of hazards and controls, it was not able to
                demonstrate that it has established an exhaustive hazard
                inventory or a fully compliant process for the evaluation of
                risk, as described in the Board’s expectations. The Board finds
                TransCanada in Non-Compliance with the requirements associated

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall have an
                established, implemented and effective process for identifying
                and monitoring compliance with all legal requirements that are
                applicable to the company in matters of safety, security and

                maintain a list of those legal requirements. The company shall
                have a documented process to identify and resolve
                non-compliances as they relate to legal requirements, which
                includes updating the management and protection programs as
                required.

              <p><strong>Finding:</strong></p>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it tracks changes in legal
                requirements using various methods including its subscription to
                an online, third party regulatory tracking and notification
                service, its own internal, regular monitoring of government
                websites, and its participation in industry groups such as the
                Canadian Energy Pipelines Association (CEPA). Legislative
                changes are then entered into its IIT database as an
                &lsquo;issue&rsquo;, which is then delegated to the appropriate
                staff to address appropriately and formally.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada provided a copy of its Legislative Monitoring
                Process document in support of its process for identifying and
                monitoring legal requirements. Last revised in&nbsp;2011, this
                document outlines the steps TransCanada takes to monitor
                legislation for any regulatory changes that could impact its
                pipe, energy and gas storage in Canada. The document also
                outlines that the Director or Vice President of a business unit
                impacted by a regulatory change is accountable to ensure
                conformance of company standards and specifications with the
                regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The process document indicates that it provides direction and
                describes the services and resources available for the review
                and management of identified regulatory requirements. It also
                includes a management of change process to affect changes where
                required. Substantively, however, the Board notes that the
                Legislative Monitoring Process is limited to listing
                legislation, and does not capture the legal requirements
                included in regulatory certificates or referenced standards. As
                such, the Board views its scope as not meeting the Board’s
                expectations. The Board is of the view that this lack of
                specificity does not support TransCanada’s assertion that it has
                a fully compliant process as specific provisions are often
                updated without an impact on the legislation’s title. Regardless
                of the adequacy of the process, the Board reviewed the
                implementation of the Legislative Monitoring Process. Record
                review indicated that TransCanada has not fully implemented the
                process as outlined. As an example, the records indicated that a
                written assignment of a &quot;Person Assigned&quot; was not
                being implemented consistently as required by the process.
                Additionally, the Board is concerned with the internal use and
                implementation of this document as demonstrated by a lack of
                awareness by staff interviewed. The audit also identified issues
                with the adequacy of the review it has undergone. Specifically,
                the Board’s review of the document noted that, while it had a
                revision date within the bi-annual review period requirements,
                the current version provided by TransCanada during the audit
                contained significantly outdated information. As an example,
                Appendix&nbsp;A - Register of Applicable Regulatory agencies for
                Canadian and Mexican Pipelines and Canadian Gas Storage,
                contains outdated information with respect to contact
                information including that of NEB staff and the Alberta Energy
                Regulator.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has not demonstrated an established, implemented and
                effective process for identifying and monitoring compliance with
                all legal requirements that are applicable to the company in
                matters of safety, security and protection of the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada also indicated that it has incorporated the
                management of its legal requirements directly into its operating
                procedures through the TransCanada Operations Procedures (TOP)
                Program. TransCanada implemented this program to manage and
                control it’s over 200&nbsp;operational procedures and their
                related documents. TransCanada indicated that within the TOP
                Program database, it has included its list of legal
                requirements. According to TransCanada staff, the TOP database
                lists all of the relevant legislation associated with the TOP
                procedures as well as the legislative driver, the contact of the
                person responsible for managing the TOP, and any changes that
                are required. Further, company staff indicated that the TOP
                database also lists the regulation, and has the functionality to
                allow staff to electronically access the listed regulations.
                According to company staff, TOP owners in their respective
                business units are responsible for monitoring the legal
                requirements that will impact its procedures during annual
                reviews. During interviews, TransCanada confirmed that
                individual TOP owners are responsible for ongoing monitoring of
                any legal change that would impact their respective programs.
                While this TOP process may function to track changes to legal
                requirements and integrate them to some extent, the Board has
                determined that it is not effective to address changes that
                would affect the SM Program, again given the legislation it
                lists for consideration includes predominantly legislative
                titles absent reference to their particular provisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the Legislative Monitoring Process document,
                TransCanada referenced other documents to demonstrate its
                compliance with these requirements. These included its
                Management System Framework Document and the Occupational Safety
                and Emergency Management TOP Regulations List. However, the
                Board notes these documents do not establish the expected
                process for determining specific legal requirements that apply
                to the SM Program and do not compile a complete list of
                regulatory requirements for the SM Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                While TransCanada demonstrated that it is tracking, listing and
                conducting internal notifications regarding some regulatory
                changes, it did not demonstrate that it maintains a complete
                list of legal requirements or an effective process to ensure
                that regulatory changes trigger either program changes or
                communication to all staff involved in the SM Program. As a
                result, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with the
                requirements associated with this sub-element.

                During the audit, TransCanada demonstrated through provided
                documentation and records and during interviews that it is
                undertaking significant program management with respect to
                performance management program monitoring. Company staff
                indicated in interviews that, on an annual basis, senior
                management sets corporate Key Performance Areas, Key Performance
                Indicators and performance standards that are applied and
                measured at every level within the organization through each
                individual’s performance agreement and corporate environmental
                scorecard (also referred to as the Annual Business Plan -
                Environment). Record review confirmed company staff interviews.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s requirements clearly require companies to
                demonstrate that they have established goals, objectives and
                targets for directing and measuring the required management
                system and programs. Companies are free to utilize their own
                internal management terminology within their management systems;
                however, they must be able to clearly demonstrate compliance to
                the individual requirements. During interviews TransCanada staff
                used a varied, but similar, vocabulary when describing what
                constitutes a company goal, objective or target. During
                interviews at the management level, TransCanada staff
                articulated multiple terms interchangeably in their description
                of the performance measurement and program management. For
                example, in reviewing the information TransCanada provided, it
                was noted that it links its HS&amp;E Programs to the Key Focus
                Area titled &quot;Safety &amp; Environmental Compliance&quot;
                which can be found in the Peak Performance documentation
                provided. However, TransCanada also refers to the Corporate
                Performance Scorecard which uses the term &quot;Key Performance
                Area&quot; (KPA). It was not clearly explained how the Key Focus
                Areas differ from Key Performance Areas or how either of these
                terms equate to goals, targets or objectives. Consequently,
                during the audit, and to advance the Board’s assessment of this
                sub-element, the Board’s auditors requested clarification from
                TransCanada via a table of concordance to confirm the
                appropriate correlation between TransCanada’s varied internal
                terminology and the regulatory requirements. This table was not,
                however, provided to Board auditors during the audit. As a
                result, the Board finds that TransCanada did not demonstrate
                compliance with respect to the requirements associated with this
                sub-element. In developing the Corrective Action Plan for this
                finding, TransCanada will have to demonstrate clearly how it is
                meeting these expectations.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall have a
                documented organizational structure that enables it to meet the
                requirements of its management system and its obligations to
                carry out activities in a manner that ensures the safety and
                security of the public, company employees and the pipeline, and
                protection of property and the environment. The documented
                structure shall enable the company to determine and communicate
                the roles, responsibilities and authority of the officers and
                employees at all levels. The company shall document contractors’

                are sufficient to meet the requirements of the management system
                and to meet the company’s obligations to design, construct,
                operate or abandon its facilities to ensure the safety and
                security of the public and the company’s employees, and the
                protection of property and the environment. The company shall

                During the audit, TransCanada demonstrated that it has
                established an organizational structure which meets the Board’s
                requirements. TransCanada provided documentation and records
                outlining its procedures and practices for establishing its
                Safety Management Program organizational structure and
                developing roles and responsibilities for management, staff and

                TransCanada’s health safety and environment governance structure
                is outlined in its HS&amp;E Management System documentation.
                This governance structure includes TransCanada’s HS&amp;E
                Committee of Corporate Board members that monitors health,
                safety and environmental practices and procedures, considers
                implementation and effectiveness of same, and makes
                recommendations to its Corporate Board with respect to HS&amp;E
                policies and procedures. This HS&amp;E Committee meets monthly,
                validates HS&amp;E performance and goals and reviews both
                incidents and investigations.
              </p>

                The Board reviewed documentation and records that indicated that
                TransCanada has established an HS&amp;E MS Responsibility Matrix
                that sets out responsibilities and accountabilities for the

              <p>
                During the Audit, TransCanada provided documentation that
                demonstrated that, in addition to the HS&amp;E MS Responsibility
                Matrix it has established a number of mechanisms for documenting
                its organizational structure. Within these documents are
                requirements and procedures for establishing, developing and
                communicating the SM program structure(s) and roles and
                responsibility documentation. These mechanisms include the

                Review of TransCanada’s documents and records, as well as
                interviews with EM and SM Program staff indicated that the
                company was able to demonstrate that it has appropriate controls
                to minimize, respond to or mitigate the safety hazards
                associated with upset or abnormal operating conditions of its
                operating processes. The formal procedures, including emergency
                management, that have been developed included the high-risk
                hazards that should be addressed. Similarly, TransCanada was
                able to demonstrate that certain SM Program staff are trained as
                first responders and as well as other roles within the Incident
                Command Structure (ICS). Further, through document and record
                review and in interviews with company staff that TransCanada’s
                standard TOPs contain the safety practices and procedures which
                will be applied if abnormal or upset conditions were detected or
                were occurring. The assessment of the management of the content
                and TOPs program is contained in other sub-element assessments

                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its SM Program staff

              <p>
                At the time of the audit, TransCanada identified that it had
                developed and implemented two separate MOC processes to manage
                and document changes that affect its SM Program. The first
                process was developed and implemented as part of its Integrity
                Management Program, and is captured in the Management of Change
                form (Integrity MOC). This Integrity MOC is asset based and
                therefore is triggered by changes to equipment or software.
                Changes are described and tracked using a standardized form that
                documents both description of the rationale for the change being
                managed, as well as internal and external stakeholder
                notifications that need to be considered under its process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second process used to manage changes in its protection
                programs leverages some of the functionality of the TransCanada
                Operating Procedures (TOPs) database and the TOPs Framework
                Process. The TOPs database contains the operating procedures and
                some related documents for each of the protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the review of both MOC processes that TransCanada was
                following at the time of the audit, the Board has determined:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Pipeline Integrity MOC process is narrow in scope in that
                  it is reserved for asset based changes; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  While the TOPs framework manages changes that are captured by
                  the existing scope of the TOPs. As the TOPs framework is
                  intended to manage versions of operational and procedural
                  documents, it does not meet all of the requirements of an MOC
                  as outlined in the OPR. This gap is includes aspects of change
                  that could exist outside of the scope of TOPs but could be
                  &quot;a new hazard or risk, any change in a design,
                  specification, standard or procedure and any change in the
                  company’s organizational structure or the legal requirements
                  applicable to the company.&quot;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on these issues, the Board has determined that by using
                the Integrity MOC process and TOPs framework process TransCanada
                has operationalized some aspects necessary for an MOC by
                documenting and communicating of some types of change through
                document versioning, these processes are not adequate separately
                or in combination to satisfy the Board’s legal requirements.
                Further, the Board determined that neither of these processes
                includes an aspect of proactively identifying change that could
                affect safety, security or the protection of the environment.
                The Board’s expectation is that the company’s MOC process be
                proactive and include requirements for the identification and
                evaluation of changes by various levels in order to determine
                that could affect the protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada indicated that it had a project
                underway to implement a singular MOC process that should be
                rolled out Company-wide in&nbsp;2014. It should be noted that
                due to the finding described in&nbsp;2.2 (Legal Requirements) of
                this report, it is unclear whether the new MOC process
                incorporates changes occurring at the regulatory requirement
                level. Through interviews it was verified the management of
                change process had been ‘piloted’ at several locations over the
                past calendar year.
              </p>
              <p>
                While TransCanada has implemented some aspects of an MOC, at the
                time of the audit, TransCanada did not demonstrate that it has
                an established and implemented a process for identifying and
                managing any change that could affect safety, security or
                protection of the environment, including any new hazard or risk,
                any change in design, specification or standard or procedure and
                any change in the company’s organizational structure or the
                legal requirements. Accordingly, the Board finds TransCanada in
                Non-Compliance with the requirements associated with this
                sub-element.

                stakeholders and has developed standard messaging relating to
                maintaining the safety and security of the pipeline and
                protection of the environment. The company was also able to
                demonstrate that it has established an internal communication
                plan to ensure that relevant safety information is communicated
                to internal stakeholders.

                During the audit TransCanada indicated that the majority of its
                SM Program documentation is kept in the form of its TOPs. In
                order to manage and control its over two hundred procedures and
                the related operational documentation, TransCanada has developed
                and implemented the TOPs Program. The TOPs Program owner is the
                Vice President of Engineering and Asset Reliability and
                TransCanada has outlined the TOPs Program in a framework
                document (TOPs Program Framework Document). According to this
                document, &quot;the objective of the TransCanada TOPs Program is
                to create a framework for the development and maintenance of the
                documentation necessary for TransCanada employees and
                contractors to efficiently and correctly conduct the operational
                and maintenance activities associated with TransCanada’s
                facilities&quot;. Also the TOPs Program Framework Document
                clarifies that, &quot;the TOP Program applies to all TransCanada
                TOPs when being created, revised, reviewed or retired&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to identifying documents, the Board also expects
                companies to have a process for preparing, reviewing, revising
                and controlling those documents, and a process for obtaining
                approval of the documents by the appropriate authority.
                TransCanada has developed and implemented a database to house
                all of the TOPs documents. Available to staff at all locations
                through the corporate Intranet, the TOPs database has the
                functionality to generate a monthly report to track and alert
                internal stakeholders to any updates to TOPs and produces a
                monthly report listing the TOPs that have been updated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified that the TOPs Program Framework Document
                provides for planning, document development, alignment with
                management systems, review, measurement, analysis, control,
                audits and improvement of the TOPs.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has a documented process for
                the development, revision and management of operational
                procedures. Records reviewed demonstrated that this process has
                been implemented. However, other pertinent Safety Management
                documents (design standards, manuals, plans, etc.) outside of
                the TOPs Framework do not have documented review and revision
                cycles. While these documents primarily function as over-arching
                guidance documents with respect to the various hazards that the
                company will or could affect, it was noted during interviews
                that these documents are used across the organization and thus
                should be periodically reviewed and revised to ensure its
                adequacy and effectiveness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information provided during the audit, TransCanada
                did not demonstrate that it has effectively established and
                implemented a process relating to the management of documents
                required to meet its OPR obligations. Accordingly, the Board
                views these processes as being Non-Compliant in meeting its
                expectations associated with this sub-element.

              <p>
                During the audit it was confirmed that TransCanada has a
                document procedure titled &quot;Planned Inspection&quot; dated
                11&nbsp;January&nbsp;2013, that provides a standardized and
                consistent approach to conducting formal workplace and facility
                inspections at TransCanada. Planned inspections are based on a
                templated form and include some regulatory requirements such as
                required postings of CLC documentation, etc. The results of
                planned inspections were observed to be included for review in
                the regular Joint Health Safety and Environment Committee
                (JHS&amp;EC) meetings. As well, the inspection results are
                inputted into the IIT system and a work order issued within
                Avantis (TransCanada’s work order system) if corrective actions
                are required.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit included samplings of the planned inspection
                records. The review identified that the inspection were
                primarily focused on housekeeping and selected safety topics.
                The standard safety topics included (among other things):
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  General Work Permits / Work Authorizations / Job Safety
                  Analyses Forms (JSA) - Are readily available at the work site;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Confined space inventory form - Current and any new space have
                  been added to the list; and
                </li>
                <li>Crane Operational Inspection - Available and complete.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The review of the inspection documentation and records
                identified some deficiencies with respect to the Board’s
                requirements. Specifically, the inspections performed do not
                adequately address the evaluation of all safety processes and
                procedures including evaluating the effectiveness of TOPs. For
                example, inspections do not adequately evaluate the adequacy and
                effectiveness of the orientation and training procedures,
                permitting procedures, pre-job planning, working alone, manual
                material handling etc. These are specific inspection
                requirements within the OPR.

                While TransCanada was able to demonstrate that it has
                established an inspection process applicable to its SM Program,
                the process did not meet the requirements associated with this
                this sub-element. Accordingly, the Board views these processes
                as being Non-Compliant in meeting its expectations associated
                with this sub-element.

                The audit identified that TransCanada has implemented its
                Incident and Issue Management Program in order to track,
                document, analyze, communicate and report hazards, near-misses,
                and injuries. The Incident and Issue Management Program is
                supported by tools and procedures designed to promote the
                reporting, tracking, resolution, communication, and sharing of
                learnings for events that cause loss or had the potential to
                cause loss or injury. Events such as injuries and illnesses,
                spills or releases and Tier&nbsp;1, Tier&nbsp;2 and Tier&nbsp;3
                audit findings are tracked and managed by the Incident and Issue
                Management Program as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Incident and Issues Management Program TOP documents the
                procedures for how incidents and issues are managed by
                TransCanada. The main components of the program include incident
                notification and reporting, investigation, follow-up and
                sharing. In support of this TOP, TransCanada has implemented an
                internal web-based Incident Management System (IMS) that defines
                how incidents are managed and to ensure that TransCanada meets
                its commitments and satisfies regulatory requirements. The IMS
                provides for incident response, notification, investigation,
                documentation, follow-up and sharing information and includes
                links to incident investigation processes, checklists policies,
                guides, tools and regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                An integral component of the IMS is the IIT Process. The IIT
                Process is an incident management process that provides for
                incident response, notification, investigation, documentation,
                follow-up and sharing of learnings. The IIT is an internal
                web-based electronic database tool that is available to
                TransCanada employees. The IIT tracks internal and external
                compliance reporting of incidents and near misses and corrective
                actions. It is used to implement actions to address hazards and
                risks and features two types of notifications that are sent to
                pre-determined notification profiles (e-mail lists). The
                profiles are for event notifications (incidents, issues) and
                action notifications sent to accountable parties. The IIT
                generates reports on incidents, events and causes and can search
                events by categories including (among other things):
                classification counts (incidents by classification), spills, gas
                releases, hazard analysis and controls, and abnormal operations.
                A training module for IIT is presented to employees as part of
                the Learning Management System. The Board also noted
                TransCanada’s established and implemented procedures for
                external reporting of incidents in accordance with regulatory
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its process for
                reporting on hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                near-misses, and for taking corrective and preventive actions
                with respect to the SM Program, was adequate to meet the Board’s
                expectations. A sampling of completed and outstanding safety
                related IIT records was reviewed from different regions of the
                pipeline system and all issues/incidents had appropriate
                corrective actions and were implemented in an acceptable
                timeframe.
              </p>
              <p>
                As TransCanada was able to demonstrate that it has a process in
                place to identify, track, analyze and resolve issues and
                incidents throughout its Incident and Issue Management Program,
                the Board views this process as being Compliant in meeting its
                expectations for this sub-element.

                Review of the documentation and records provided by TransCanada
                demonstrated that it has established and implemented an audit
                program to assess its management programs and provide quality
                assurance of same. This multi-level approach consists of:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tier&nbsp;1 - Conformance reviews;</li>
                <li>Tier&nbsp;2 - Inspections: Planned inspections;</li>
                <li>
                  Tier&nbsp;3 - Internal system audits and targeted audits
                  focused on maintenance and equipment suitability; and
                </li>
                <li>Tier&nbsp;4 - External audits and assessments</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Records provided by TransCanada during the audit demonstrated
                that the audit program is presently being implemented at a
                frequency exceeding the OPR requirements to audit on a maximum
                three-year interval. Review of TransCanada’s audit program
                documentation and records of audits indicated that TransCanada’s
                audits are not meeting the requirements for audits outlined in
                OPR section&nbsp;53. Specifically, TransCanada could not
                demonstrate that the audits are being conducted to ensure that
                their pipelines are designed, constructed, operated and
                abandoned in compliance with the legal requirements outlined in
                that section. Review of the internal audit standard and audit
                specific internal audit protocols and records indicated that
                TransCanada focuses almost exclusively on evaluating the
                implementation of its existing programs, procedures and
                practices, as designed, as opposed to statutory compliance.
                TransCanada did provide records indicating that some of the
                content was covered during the external audit processes
                (Tier&nbsp;4); however, TransCanada was unable to provide
                appropriate records of the external audit protocols or working
                files. As a result, it could not clearly demonstrate the content
                and extent of the review. Further, review of records outlining
                the direction provided by TransCanada to its external auditors
                outlined a focus on conformance to internal requirements or
                conformance to external ISO standards. While the Board
                encourages the practice of comparing performance relative to
                international standards in order to improve audit programs,
                conformance to internal procedures and external ISO standards
                alone is not sufficient for a quality assurance program because
                it does not include all relevant legal requirements. Without an
                evaluation of compliance to its legal requirements, TransCanada
                has not established an audit program that can determine the
                adequacy and effectiveness of its management system.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has also established and implemented a process for
                developing and implementing corrective and preventive actions if
                deficiencies are noted during Tier&nbsp;3 audits. This process
                utilizes its IIT database for assignment, tracking and closeout
                for all internal audit findings that have associated corrective
                or preventative actions identified.
              </p>
              <p>
                Findings from the Tier&nbsp;4, third party audits are discussed,
                prioritized and managed at the senior management level. However,
                the Board noted deficiencies in relation to quality assurance
                and corrective and preventive actions. The Board was unable to
                view, as part of a process, how TransCanada and its management
                consistently evaluated and prioritized the findings,
                recommendations and the development of preventive and corrective
                actions resulting from the internal and external audits. While
                management must have some latitude to manage the results of
                findings, there must be documented processes for evaluating and
                prioritizing audit findings to ensure timely statutory
                compliance and the safety of public, workers and the
                environment. The Board was unable to find clear direction to
                guide managers during the development of corrective and
                preventive action plans provided within the processes reviewed.
                This may have contributed to unacceptable implementation periods
                for some of the identified deficiencies contained within the
                audit documents provided by TransCanada. For example,
                TransCanada’s 2009&nbsp;audit identified the need to develop and
                implement an MOC process across the company. During the Board’s
                2013&nbsp;audit (this audit) it was noted that the MOC process
                would not be fully implemented until&nbsp;2014. This is a lag
                period of at least 5&nbsp;years from identification through to
                correction. The Board clearly described its MOC requirements in
                its 2009&nbsp;Audit Protocol. The Board is of the view that all
                findings related to compliance must be acted on in a timely
                manner. As another example, the Board notes that in
                TransCanada’s 2009&nbsp;Tier&nbsp;4 third party audit, the
                auditor provided recommendations to TransCanada’s management to
                conduct third party audits to measure compliance with HSE laws
                and regulations. This recommendation is consistent with the
                Board’s findings in this audit; however, as per records reviewed
                during the audit, TransCanada management decided not to act on
                the recommendation. Review of TransCanada’s internal audit
                processes indicated that there are no clear requirements to act
                on known or potential non-compliance findings during the
                management review of the audit results. This particular example
                could have led to compliant findings being made in other
                sub-elements in the Board’s audit if TransCanada had acted on
                the recommendation.
              </p>
              <p>
                While TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its quality
                assurance program is implemented on a scale that exceeds the
                Board’s expectations with respect to frequency, its audits
                focused on conformance to internal requirements rather than
                compliance with statutory requirements. There was also a lack of
                guidance to enable senior management to prioritize and manage
                corrective and preventive actions for deficiencies identified in
                audits. This sub-element has therefore been found by the Board
                to be Non-Compliant.

              <p><strong>Finding:</strong></p>
              <p>
                During the audit TransCanada demonstrated that it has
                established a Business Information Management Program to manage
                the records that are generated in support of or in performance
                of its operational activities. The Records Classification System
                and Records Retention Schedule documents have been developed to
                reflect regulatory and business information retention
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the Audit confirmed through documentation and
                record review that TransCanada has implemented a record
                retention process as outlined in the Operating Procedures
                Program Framework Document, Revision: 04 Effective Date:
                13&nbsp;June&nbsp;2012, section&nbsp;2.3. This process addresses
                the controls of records related to TOPs and includes appropriate
                types of records to be retained, retention and disposition
                timeframes and disposal methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Audit Team verified TransCanada has several repositories for
                safety-related information including key processes such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>IIT system is used for tracking incidents;</li>
                <li>
                  Learnings management system for training related record
                  retention; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minutes of meetings, inspections, job safety analysis and
                  Pre-job plans are maintained at facility locations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Audit Team requested, received and reviewed several safety
                related records, such as job safety analyses, minutes of safety
                committees meetings, inspections and pre-job plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit did identify one issue with respect to records
                management at TransCanada. A review of safety related records at
                several regional/facility locations indicated varying record
                storage and retention practices for site related information.
                Interviews confirmed there were no formal procedures for
                retaining these safety related records such as permits, minutes
                and contractor documentation. The missing processes relate to
                the collection and storage of information used in the course of
                workers’ duties.
              </p>
              <p>
                While TransCanada demonstrated many of the records management
                process required, the audit identified deficiencies relating to
                the collection, storage and access of information at regional
                sites. The Board finds TransCanada in Non-Compliance with the
                requirements associated with this sub-element.

                The Health, Safety and Environment Management System Framework
                (HS&amp;E Framework) document describes the HS&amp;E Governance
                Structure for TransCanada. An HS&amp;E Committee of the
                TransCanada Board is comprised of Directors that monitor
                practices and procedures to ensure compliance with legislation,
                conformity with policies, procedures and programs, and the
                prevention and mitigation of losses. The HS&amp;E Committee of
                the TransCanada Board also considers implementation and
                effectiveness of policies, procedures and programs and makes
                recommends to the Board. The HS&amp;E Committee meets monthly,
                validates HS&amp;E performance and goals, and conducts a
                critical review of incidents and incident trends. The HS&amp;E
                Management System Responsibility Matrix sets out
                responsibilities, accountabilities, consultation and information
                for the HS&amp;E Management System for all employees. Annually,
                the HS&amp;E committee sets goals and objectives, with overall
                key performance indicators to monitor progress through
                scorecards. The scorecards are based on a vast number of
                metrics. TransCanada provided records of the HS&amp;E Committee
                meetings conducted on a monthly basis over the last
                two&nbsp;years. These records demonstrate the review of
                performance and incidents, and the assignment of actions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews with TransCanada staff and review of the supporting
                documentation and records provided by TransCanada indicated that
                the company undertakes a significant amount of work in the
                oversight of its Health, Safety and Environmental (HS&amp;E)
                programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has a description of a Management Review process in
                the Health, Safety and Environment Management System document
                dated 18&nbsp;July&nbsp;2011. This document outlines a high
                level overview for: collecting health, safety and environmental
                management system (HS&amp;E MS) metrics; evaluation of the
                HS&amp;E MS; development of management recommendations;
                communication of findings to senior management; and for the
                implementation of program modifications. Interviews indicated
                there are several processes for reviewing safety related
                performance including scorecards, issues, audit findings and
                other information. These reviews are performed at several
                organizational levels within TransCanada and flow vertically
                throughout the organization. However, a comprehensive management
                review process that included a system, element, procedural,
                statistics, audit, monitoring, performance and other information
                compiled into a formal management review was not demonstrated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit conformed that TransCanada’s senior management
                and Board of Directors are significantly involved in the
                direction and review of the company’s HS&amp;E related
                management system programs and programs. This audit, however,
                has made findings that could be partly attributed to management
                review and action requirements. These include findings relating
                to the development of the scope of company audits, the
                evaluation of audit findings and recommendations and the
                development and implementation Corrective Action Plans to
                address some of the deficiencies identified by the audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the Board was able to confirm that TransCanada is
                undertaking several management review activities consistent with
                the descriptions included in the HS&amp;E Framework document, it
                was not able to review a documented and comprehensive management
                review process applicable to the SM Program that described
                activities for adequately and effectively undertaking its
                management reviews and for ensuring continual improvement as
                described in the Board’s expectations. This sub-element has

              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate effective and implemented Management
                Systems into their day-to-day operations. These programs include
                the tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure that
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. Safety
                Management Programs enable companies to communicate with
                stakeholders to promote safety, environmental protection and
                regulatory compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s comprehensive audit of
                TransCanada’s Safety Management Program as it applies to its
                NEB-regulated subsidiaries and pipeline facilities. The audit
                was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013. The amendment,
                among other things, now requires companies to have an effective
                and well-documented Safety Management program as a key component
                of their Management Systems. The OPR was promulgated with no
                implementation grace period for federally regulated companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies five Management System elements. These five
                elements are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each
                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. The
                NEB requires companies to be compliant with one hundred percent
                of the regulatory requirements of a sub-element being assessed.
                If a company’s program is found to be deficient with respect to
                any regulatory requirement, the entire sub-element will be found
                in Non-Compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit finds that TransCanada has developed and
                implemented a program to manage and control the hazards
                associated with potential safety incidents and emergencies with
                its operations. The documents and records reviewed during this
                audit demonstrate that TransCanada is ensuring company personnel
                are appropriately informed of and trained in Safety Management
                practices and procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit also identified a number of Non-Compliant findings,
                the majority of which fall into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the lack of documented, established and implemented processes
                  that correspond with the Management System requirements as
                  required by the recently updated OPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the development and implementation of effective processes
                  related to ongoing, internal evaluation of the compliance to
                  legal requirements, and the adequacy and effectiveness of its
                  Safety Management Program; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  inability to demonstrate consistent implementation and
                  integration of the OPR management system requirements to the
                  Safety Management Program.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, TransCanada must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval detailing how it
                intends to resolve Non-Compliances identified by this audit. The
                Board will assess the implementation of the corrective actions
                to confirm they are completed in an expedient manner and on a
                system-wide basis. The Board will also continue to monitor the
                overall implementation and effectiveness of TransCanada’s
                Management Systems through targeted compliance verification
                activities as a part of its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2 id="s1">1.0 Audit Terminology and Definitions</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, independent and documented
                process for obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively to
                determine the extent to which audit criteria are fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> Addresses the
                non-compliances identified in the Audit Report and explains the
                methods and actions which will be used to &quot;correct&quot;
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                adequacy of programs or elements in meeting the requirements of
                the NEB Act and its associated regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action must be
                developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order allowing individual
                activities to be completed in an effective and safe manner. The
                procedure will also outline roles, responsibilities and
                authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> A systematic series of actions or
                changes taking place in a definite order and directed towards a
                result.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures to regularly accomplish a result. The program
                outlines how plans and procedures are linked, and how each one
                contributes towards the result.

              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate a regulated company’s compliance with its
                regulations, the NEB undertakes management system audits of its
                regulated companies. The NEB requires that each company
                demonstrate the adequacy and implementation of the methods the
                company has selected and employed in order to proactively
                identify and manage hazards and risks to achieve compliance.
              </p>
              Following the audits, companies are required to submit and
              implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all findings of
              Non-Compliance. The results of the audits are considered as a part
              of the NEB’s risk-informed life cycle approach to compliance
              assurance.

              <p>
                TransCanada operates approximately 42,000&nbsp;km of federally
                regulated pipeline from British Columbia to Quebec. In order for
                the audit of TransCanada and its subsidiaries to reflect the way
                it runs its operations, the NEB audited each program separately.
                Therefore, this audit is one of a series of six program audits
                having been undertaken by the Board with respect to
                NEB-regulated facilities operated within TransCanada’s
                organization. The audits are titled:

              </ul>
              <p>
                These audits identified that TransCanada operates its facilities
                using a common organizational and technical management structure
                for all of the facilities noted. Some of the findings are
                therefore similar in each audit and the individual audit reports
                reflect this. During the audit, the Board reviewed and evaluated
                a sample set of facilities based on the individual activities,
                as well as the associated hazards and risks, as reflected in the
                individual audit reports.

                In utilising the OPR, the Board notes its amendment on
                21&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013, which clarified the Board’s
                expectations with respect to establishing and implementing
                formal Management Systems and Environmental Protection Programs.
                These amendments were preceded by consultation between the Board
                and its regulated companies, and accordingly the OPR was not
                promulgated with an implementation grace period. As a result,
                the audit of TransCanada’s Environmental Protection Program made
                use of the OPR, as amended.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scope of the audit included the following companies that

              </ul>
              <p>
                These subsidiaries hold the certificates for TransCanada’s
                NEB-regulated facilities, which include the Canadian Mainline
                (operating under TransCanada PipeLines Limited), Keystone
                Pipeline (operating under TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP
                Ltd.), TQM Pipeline System (operating under Trans Québec &amp;

              <h2 id="s6">6.0 Audit Process and Methodology</h2>
              <p>
                TransCanada operates approximately 42,000 km of pipelines and
                associated facilities across the country. TransCanada and its
                subsidiaries operate these facilities using a common Management
                System. Accordingly, and in order to complete an assessment of
                its Management System in a reasonable timeframe, the Board
                elected to audit and assess a representative sample of
                TransCanada and its subsidiaries utilizing a risk-informed
                approach that included a review of previous compliance history.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board chose to use NGTL as its representative sample. The
                Board also included areas of the TransCanada system presenting
                unique potential hazards in order to assess the application of
                hazard-specific system elements. As such, the audit included a
                review of documents and records as well as site visits and
                interviews in TransCanada’s Central Region.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has divided its Canadian facilities and assets into
                five operational regions. These regions are the Wildrose Region,
                Rocky Mountain Region, Central Region, Northern Ontario Region
                and Eastern Region. As TransCanada applies the same Safety
                Management Program across all of its systems, any findings and
                corrective actions required will be applied across all of
                TransCanada’s systems and subsidiaries. The NEB will verify the
                implementation of any corrective actions with subsequent
                compliance verification activities at each subsidiary once the
                Corrective Action Plan has been approved and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s utilization of one set of policies and procedures
                for its Safety Management Program guided the implementation of
                the Board’s audit process. Interviews and document review on the
                Safety Management program were conducted at the Head Office in
                Calgary, Alberta, and site visits were conducted at select NGTL
                facilities. During these site visits, activities were evaluated
                for each Management System element through interviews with a
                number of personnel from various levels, as well as document and
                record review.

                On 19&nbsp;June&nbsp;2013, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from TransCanada in Calgary, Alberta to discuss
                the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. A schedule for
                conducting the staff interviews and site verifications was also
                developed at this meeting. Throughout the audit, daily summaries
                with action items were provided to TransCanada.
              </p>
              On 24&nbsp;October&nbsp;2013, the Board held an audit
              Pre-Close-Out meeting with TransCanada to discuss additional
              information that could be of value to the Board prior to compiling
              its draft audit report. An audit Close-Out meeting was held on
              6&nbsp;November&nbsp;2013.

                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. The
                NEB requires companies to be compliant with one hundred percent
                of the regulatory requirements of each of the management system
                sub-elements being assessed. If a company’s program is found to
                be deficient with respect to any regulatory requirement, the
                entire sub-element will be found in non-compliance. A corrective
                action plan will be required in order to demonstrate to the
                Board that appropriate actions will be taken to achieve full
                compliance.

              <h3>Element&nbsp;1.0 - Policy and Commitment</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 - Leadership and Accountability</h4>
              <p>
                The position of accountable officer was introduced into the OPR
                in April of&nbsp;2013. The Board is satisfied that TransCanada
                has appointed an accountable officer and outlined the
                responsibilities of this position in accordance with the
                regulations and submission deadlines. Subsequent NEB compliance
                activities will verify the adequacy and effectiveness of the
                process implementation. The Board finds this sub-element to be
                Compliant.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 - Policy and Commitment Statements</h4>
              <p>
                The TransCanada’s Health, Safety and Environment Management
                System identifies safety management activities,
                responsibilities, processes and the enabling tools and the Code
                of Business Ethics outlines reporting requirements. However,
                these documents do not include or incorporate a specific policy
                for the internal reporting of hazards, potential hazards,
                incidents and near-misses including the conditions under which a
                person who makes a report will be granted immunity from
                disciplinary action as required by the Board. As a result, the
                Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;2.0 - Planning</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.1 - Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment
                and Control
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established and implemented
                a Safety Management Program incorporating procedures and several
                types of tools for the identification of hazards and controls to
                mitigate those hazards. However, it was not able to demonstrate
                that it has introduced the required level of specificity for the
                establishment of a hazard inventory, the evaluation of risk or a
                systematic implementation of corresponding controls as required
                by the Board. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 - Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it is tracking, listing and
                conducting some internal notifications regarding its legal
                responsibilities as that relates to regulatory changes. However,
                it did not demonstrate that it has a complete list of legal
                requirements. It also did not demonstrate an effective process
                to ensure regulatory changes trigger necessary program changes
                or communication to all staff involved in the Safety Management
                Program. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.3 - Goals, Objectives and Targets</h4>
              <p>
                During the audit, and to advance the Board’s assessment of this
                sub-element, the Board’s auditors requested clarification from
                TransCanada via a table of concordance to confirm the
                appropriate correlation between TransCanada’s varied internal
                terminology and the regulatory requirements. This table was not,
                however, provided to Board auditors during the audit. As a
                result, the Board finds that TransCanada did not demonstrate
                compliance with respect to the requirements associated with this
                sub-element. In developing the Corrective Action Plan for this
                finding, TransCanada will have to demonstrate clearly how it is
                meeting these expectations. As a result, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.

              </h4>
              <p>
                The Board finds TransCanada’s processes and established
                hierarchy of responsibility within the Safety Management program
                to be Compliant.

                The Board determined that TransCanada’s processes for developing
                and implementing corrective, mitigative, preventive and
                protective controls associated with the hazards and risks of its
                operations to be Compliant.

              </h4>
              <p>
                The Board found that TransCanada’s processes for plans and
                procedures to identify the potential for upset or abnormal
                operating conditions, accidental releases, incidents and
                emergency situations including established, implemented and
                effective process for developing contingency plans for abnormal
                events that may occur during construction, operation,
                maintenance, abandonment or emergency situations to meet
                expectations. TransCanada demonstrated that its Safety
                Management Team plays a role in supporting the Emergency
                Management Program.  The Board finds TransCanada Compliant with
                the requirements regarding this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.3 - Management of Change</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada has developed some aspects of a management of change
                process. It has also begun implementing some elements of the
                plan as they related to pipeline integrity and operating
                procedures. The new Management of Change is scheduled to be
                fully implemented by the end&nbsp;2014. However, at the time of
                the audit, TransCanada did not demonstrate that it has an
                established and implemented a proactive process for identifying
                and managing changes that could affect safety, security or
                protection of the environment. As a result, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.

              </h4>
              <p>
                The Board found TransCanada’s processes for establishing,
                implementing effective processes for developing competency
                requirements and training programs to be Compliant with this
                sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.5 - Communication</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established a communication
                plan that identifies the appropriate stakeholders and developed
                messages relating to maintaining the safety and security of the
                pipeline and protection of the environment. Based on the
                information provided during the audit, the Board finds this
                sub-element to be Compliant.

              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.6 - Documentation and Document Control</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada has an established Electronic Document Management
                System to control documents across TransCanada operations. The
                Board is of the view that there is no process for preparing,
                reviewing, revising and controlling of safety-related
                non-procedural documentation such as standards and plans
                including contractor documentation. As a result, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.

              <p>
                The Board’s review of the inspection documentation and records
                identified some deficiencies with respect to the
                requirements.&nbsp; Specifically, the inspections performed do
                not adequately address the evaluation of effectiveness of all
                safety processes and procedures. For example, inspections do not
                evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the orientation and
                training procedures, permitting procedures, pre-job planning,
                working alone, manual material handling etc.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established an inspection
                process applicable to its Safety Management Program, the process
                did not meet the requirements associated with this
                sub-element.&nbsp; As a result, the Board views these processes
                as being Non-Compliant in meeting its expectations associated
                with this sub-element.

                Near-misses
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its process for
                reporting on hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                near-misses, and for taking corrective and preventive actions
                with respect to the Safety Management Program, was adequate to
                meet the Board’s expectations. A sampling of completed and
                outstanding safety related Incident and Issue Tracking records
                was reviewed from different regions of the pipeline system and
                all issues/incidents had appropriate corrective actions and were
                implemented in an acceptable timeframe.
              </p>
              <p>
                As TransCanada was able to demonstrate that it has a process in
                place to identify, track, analyze and resolve issues and
                incidents throughout its Incident and Issue Management Program,
                the Board views this process as being Compliant in meeting its
                expectations for this sub-element.

              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.3 - Internal Audit</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that its quality assurance program is
                implemented on a frequency that exceeds regulatory requirements.
                However, implementation of the program only measures performance
                relative to internal TransCanada requirements and does not
                include compliance relative to legal requirements. As a result,
                the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.4 - Records Management</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada has implemented a record retention process as
                outlined in the Operating Procedures Program Framework and this
                process addresses the controls of records related to TransCanada
                Operating Procedures and includes appropriate types of records
                to be retained, the retention and disposition timeframes and the
                disposal methods. However, safety related records at several
                locations indicated varying record storage and retention
                practices and interviews confirmed there were no formal
                procedures for retaining safety related records such as permits,
                minutes and contractor documentation. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.

              <h3>Element&nbsp;5.0 - Management Review</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;5.1 - Management Review</h4>
              <p>
                The Board was able to confirm that TransCanada is undertaking a
                significant number of management review activities consistent
                with the descriptions included in TransCanada’s Health Safety
                and Environment Framework document. However, the Board considers
                senior management’s involvement and performance in particular
                areas to be critical. These include evaluating and managing the
                results of audits, and the results of compliance verification
                activities conducted by regulatory agencies. The Board has made
                findings of non-compliance in other sub-elements dealing with
                the development of the scope of company audits, and the
                development and implementation of corrective action plans, which
                it views to properly fall within the care and control of senior
                management. In addition, TransCanada was unable to demonstrate a
                documented and comprehensive management review process of the
                Safety Management Program describing activities for adequately
                and effectively undertaking management reviews on a consistent
                basis and for ensuring continual improvement. Based on these
                reasons, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate effective and implemented management
                systems into their day-to-day operations. These programs include
                the tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure that
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. In particular,
                Safety Management Programs are required by the Board to ensure
                that companies have a program in place to provide ongoing safety
                processes and procedures in order to prevent accidents, injuries
                for its employees and contractors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of this audit TransCanada was required to
                demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of its Management
                Systems and Safety Management Program to the Board. The Board
                reviewed documentation and records provided by TransCanada,
                conducted interviews with TransCanada staff and performed site
                tours at selected facilities. Based on this review, the Board
                finds TransCanada has developed and implemented a Safety
                Management Program that addresses significant, identified
                hazards and risks associated with potential incidents or
                emergencies on its pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the work being conducted and the processes in
                place, the audit has also identified areas of Non-Compliance
                with NEB requirements. The Board concludes that the majority of
                the Non-Compliant findings fall into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the lack of documented, established and implemented processes
                  that correspond with the Management System requirements as
                  required by the recently updated OPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the development and implementation of effective processes
                  related to ongoing, internal evaluation of the compliance to
                  legal requirements, and the adequacy and effectiveness of its
                  Safety Management Program; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  inability to demonstrate consistent implementation and
                  integration of the OPR management system requirements to the
                  Safety Management Program.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. As per the Board’s standard audit
                practice, TransCanada must develop and submit a Corrective
                Action Plan describing its proposed methods to resolve the
                non-compliances identified by this audit and the timeline in
                which the corrective actions will be completed. TransCanada will
                be required to submit the Corrective Action Plan for approval
                within 30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report being issued by
                the Board. The Board will make its final Audit Report and
                TransCanada’s approved Corrective Action Plan public on the
                Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of TransCanada’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of TransCanada’s Safety
                Management Program and management system as a whole through
                targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
                ongoing regulatory mandate.

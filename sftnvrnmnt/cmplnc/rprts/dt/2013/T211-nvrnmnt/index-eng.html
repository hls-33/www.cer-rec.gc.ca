              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate effective and implemented Management
                Systems into their day-to-day operations. These systems include
                the tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure that
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. In the public
                interest, the Board holds companies accountable for safety and
                environmental outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s comprehensive audit of
                TransCanada’s Environmental Protection Program as it applies to
                its NEB-regulated subsidiaries and pipeline facilities. The
                audit was conducted using the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR) as amended on 21&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013. The amendment,
                among other things, now requires companies to have an effective
                and well-documented Environmental Protection Program as a key
                component of their Management Systems. The OPR was promulgated
                with no implementation grace period for federally regulated
                companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit has identified that TransCanada has developed
                and implemented an internal program to manage and control the
                environmental hazards associated with its facilities, processes
                and activities. The documents and records reviewed during this
                audit also demonstrate that TransCanada is ensuring that company
                personnel and contractors are appropriately informed and/or
                trained in Environmental Protection Program practices and
                procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s management demonstrated that the company has
                resourced the Environmental Protection Program and has involved
                itself in implementation and oversight at senior management
                levels. TransCanada has also demonstrated that it has
                established an appropriate inspection and monitoring program to
                ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of its Environmental
                Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies five Management System elements. These five
                elements are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each
                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. The
                NEB requires companies to be compliant with one hundred per cent
                of the regulatory requirements of each of the Management System
                sub-elements being assessed. If a company’s program is found to
                be deficient with respect to any regulatory requirement, the
                entire sub-element will be found in Non-Compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit also identified a number of Non-Compliant findings,
                the majority of which fall into three general categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the lack of documented, established and implemented processes
                  that correspond with the Management System requirements as
                  required by the OPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the insufficient development and implementation of effective
                  processes related to ongoing, internal evaluation of the
                  compliance to legal requirements, and the adequacy and
                  effectiveness of its Environmental Protection Program; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  the inability to demonstrate full implementation of existing
                  processes.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address the Non-Compliant findings
                identified in this audit. Within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit
                Report being issued, TransCanada must develop and submit a
                Corrective Action Plan for Board approval detailing how it
                intends to resolve Non-Compliances identified by this audit. The
                Board will assess the implementation of the corrective actions
                to confirm they are completed in an expedient manner and on a
                system-wide basis. The Board will also continue to monitor the
                overall implementation and effectiveness of TransCanada’s
                Management Systems through targeted compliance verification
                activities as a part of its ongoing regulatory mandate.

              <h2 id="s1">1.0 Audit Terminology and Definitions</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Audit:</strong> A systematic, independent and documented
                process for obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively to
                determine the extent to which audit criteria are fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Compliant:</strong> A program element meets legal
                requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed
                and implemented programs, processes and procedures that meet
                legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Corrective Action Plan:</strong> Addresses the
                Non-Compliances identified in the Audit Report and explains the
                methods and actions which will be used to &quot;correct&quot;
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Finding:</strong> The evaluation or determination of the
                adequacy of programs or elements in meeting the requirements of
                the National Energy Board Act and its associated regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Compliant:</strong> A program element does not meet
                legal requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has
                developed and implemented programs, processes and procedures
                that meet the legal requirements. A corrective action must be
                developed and implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Procedure:</strong> A documented series of steps
                followed in a regular and defined order allowing individual
                activities to be completed in an effective and safe manner. The
                procedure will also outline roles, responsibilities and
                authorities required for completing each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> A systematic series of actions or
                changes taking place in a definite order and directed towards a
                result.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Program:</strong> A documented set of processes and
                procedures to regularly accomplish a result. The program
                outlines how plans and procedures are linked, and how each one
                contributes towards the result.

              <h2 id="s3">3.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate a regulated company’s compliance with its
                regulations, the NEB undertakes Management System audits of its
                regulated companies. The NEB requires that each company
                demonstrate the adequacy and implementation of the methods the
                company has selected and employed in order to proactively
                identify and manage hazards and risks to achieve compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the audits, companies are required to submit and
                implement a Corrective Action Plan to address all findings of
                Non-Compliance. The results of the audits are considered as a
                part of the NEB’s risk-informed life cycle approach to
                compliance assurance.

              <p>
                TransCanada operates approximately 42,000&nbsp;km of federally
                regulated pipeline from British Columbia to Quebec. In order for
                the audit of TransCanada to reflect the way it runs its
                operations, the NEB audited each program separately. Therefore,
                this audit is one of a series of six program audits having been
                undertaken by the Board with respect to NEB regulated facilities
                operated within TransCanada’s organization. The audits are
                titled:
              </p>

                </li>
                <li><em>TransCanada Safety Management Program Audit;</em></li>
                <li>
                  <em>TransCanada Environmental Protection Program Audit;</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>TransCanada Emergency Management Program Audit;</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>TransCanada Third Party Crossings Program Audit; and </em>

                <li><em>TransCanada Public Awareness Program Audit.</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These audits identified that TransCanada operates its facilities
                using a common organizational and technical management structure
                for all of the facilities noted. Some findings are therefore
                similar in each audit and the individual audit reports reflect
                this.

              <h2 id="s5">5.0 Audit Objectives and Scope</h2>
              <p>
                The objective of the audit was to determine the adequacy and
                effectiveness of TransCanada’s Environmental Protection Program.
                The requirements against which TransCanada was audited are
                contained within:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The <em>National Energy Board Act</em>;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>;
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  TransCanada’s policies, programs, practices and procedures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In utilising the OPR, the Board notes its amendment on
                21&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013, which clarified the Board’s
                expectations with respect to establishing and implementing
                formal Management Systems and Environmental Protection Programs.
                These amendments were preceded by consultation between the Board
                and its regulated companies, and accordingly the OPR was not
                promulgated with an implementation grace period. As a result,
                the audit of TransCanada’s Environmental Protection Program made
                use of the OPR, as amended.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scope of the audit included TransCanada PipeLines Limited
                and its subsidiaries including specifically:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>TransCanada PipeLines Limited;</li>

                <li>Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd.; and</li>
                <li>NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These subsidiaries hold the certificates for TransCanada’s
                NEB-regulated facilities, which include the Canadian Mainline
                (operating under TransCanada PipeLines Limited), Keystone
                Pipeline (operating under TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP
                Ltd.), TQM Pipeline System (operating under TQM), Foothills
                System (operating under Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd.), and the
                Alberta System (operating under NGTL). For more TransCanada

              <h2 id="s6">6.0 Audit Process and Methodology</h2>
              <p>
                TransCanada and its subsidiaries operate their facilities using
                a common organizational and technical management structure.
                Accordingly, and in order to complete an assessment of its
                Management System in a reasonable timeframe, the Board elected
                to audit and assess a representative sample of TransCanada and
                its subsidiaries utilizing a risk-informed approach that
                included a review of previous compliance history. The Board
                reviewed and evaluated a selection of facilities within the
                representative sample based on the individual activities
                conducted at those facilities, as well as the associated hazards
                and risks. For this audit, the Board chose to use NGTL and the
                Alberta System as its representative sample.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has divided its Canadian facilities and assets into
                five operational regions. These regions are the Wildrose Region,
                Rocky Mountain Region, Central Region, Northern Ontario Region
                and Eastern Region. As TransCanada applies the same
                Environmental Protection Program across all of its systems, any
                findings and corrective actions required will be applied across
                all of TransCanada’s systems and subsidiaries. The NEB will
                verify the implementation of any corrective actions with
                subsequent compliance verification activities at each subsidiary
                once TransCanada’s Corrective Action Plan has been approved and
                implemented.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s utilization of one set of policies and procedures
                for its Environmental Protection Program also guided the
                implementation of the Board’s audit process. Interviews and
                document review on the Environmental Protection Program were
                conducted at the Head Office in Calgary, Alberta. Site visits
                were conducted at select NGTL, TransCanada Mainline and Keystone
                facilities. During these site visits, activities were evaluated
                for each Management System element through interviews with a
                number of personnel at various levels, as well as document and
                record review.

              <p>
                The audit involved Board review of TransCanada company
                documents, interviewing company representatives at all levels of
                the organization, and conducting field verification of
                Compliance with NEB requirements at selected sites.

              <p>
                On 19&nbsp;June&nbsp;2013, an opening meeting was conducted with
                representatives from TransCanada in Calgary, Alberta to discuss
                the Board’s audit objectives, scope and process. A schedule for
                conducting the staff interviews and site verifications was also
                developed at this meeting. Throughout the audit, daily summaries
                with action items were provided to TransCanada.

              <p>
                On 24&nbsp;October&nbsp;2013, the Board held an audit
                Pre-Close-Out meeting with TransCanada to discuss additional
                information that could be of value to the Board prior to
                compiling its draft audit report. An audit Close-Out meeting was
                held on 6&nbsp;November&nbsp;2013.

              <p>
                TransCanada’s Environmental Protection Program applies to all
                TransCanada corporate entities and the operation of all
                TransCanada natural gas and oil pipelines and associated
                facilities in Canada.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Environmental Protection Program oversees environmental
                considerations from both construction related projects as well
                the operational phase of their pipeline systems. Overall
                management of the Environmental Protection Program resides in
                the TransCanada head office in Calgary in addition to the
                majority of the subject matter expertise. To assist in the
                oversight of its Environmental Protection Program from an
                operation aspect, TransCanada has established regional
                environmental specialists across its pipeline system.

              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies five Management System elements. These five
                elements are further broken down into 17&nbsp;sub-elements. Each
                sub-element reflects a number of regulatory requirements. The
                NEB requires companies to be compliant with one hundred percent
                of the regulatory requirements of each of the Management System
                sub-elements being assessed. If a company’s program is found to
                be deficient with respect to any regulatory requirement, the
                entire sub-element will be found in Non-Compliance. A Corrective
                Action Plan will be required in order to demonstrate to the
                Board that appropriate actions will be taken to achieve full
                compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following summary represents a high-level overview of the
                Board’s audit findings for TransCanada’s Environmental
                Protection Program based on information provided for the audit.
                Details of how each of the audited elements impacts the
                Environmental Protection Program and a full description of the
                Board’s assessment for each of its Management System

              <h3>Element&nbsp;1.0 - Policy and Commitment</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.1 - Leadership and Accountability</h4>
              <p>
                As the position of accountable officer was introduced into the
                OPR in April of&nbsp;2013, there has not been time for a full
                planning cycle to allow for the evaluation of the substantive
                responsibilities attached to this position. Therefore, in
                determining compliance to this element, the Board is satisfied
                that TransCanada has appointed an accountable officer and
                outlined the responsibilities of this position to the Board in
                accordance with the regulations and submission deadlines. As a
                result, the Board views this process as being Compliant in
                meeting its expectations for this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;1.2 - Policy and Commitment Statements</h4>
              <p>
                The Board determined that TransCanada’s Health, Safety and
                Environment Commitment Statement provides clear policies and
                goals towards environmental protection. However, it is not clear
                from TransCanada’s Code of Business Ethics that TransCanada
                staff who report hazards, potential hazards, incidents and
                near-misses would be granted immunity from disciplinary action
                as required by the Board’s expectations. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;2.0 - Planning</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.1 - Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment
                and Control
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has developed an inventory of
                its environmental hazards related to its activities associated
                with normal operations. However, these hazards were identified
                informally through corporate knowledge and not as the result of
                a documented process. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada
                to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.2 - Legal Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it is tracking, listing and
                communicating some of its legal requirements. However,
                TransCanada did not demonstrate that it has a complete inventory
                of specific legal requirements. Therefore, TransCanada did not
                demonstrate that it has an established, implemented and
                effective process for identifying and monitoring compliance with
                all legal requirements that are applicable to the company in
                matters of safety, security and protection of the environment as
                required in the Board’s expectations. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;2.3 - Goals, Objectives and Targets</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has developed a corporate
                objective to remain Compliant with environmental regulations.
                However, it did not demonstrate that specific environmental
                protection goals, objectives and targets were developed or
                discussed at management meetings. Furthermore, linkages between
                TransCanada’s varied internal terminology and regulatory
                requirements were not confirmed. During the audit, Board
                auditors requested clarification from TransCanada via a table of
                concordance, but this table was not provided to Board auditors.
                Therefore, TransCanada did not demonstrate that it has an
                established, implemented and effective process for developing,
                and setting goals, objectives and specific targets relevant to
                the risks and hazards associated with its facilities and
                activities. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;2.4 - Organizational Structure, Roles and
                Responsibilities
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Board views TransCanada’s processes for resource evaluation
                and its established hierarchy of responsibility within the
                Environmental Protection Program as being Compliant with this
                sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;3.0 - Implementation</h3>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;3.1 - Operational Control-Normal Operations
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Board views TransCanada’s processes for developing and
                implementing corrective, mitigative, preventive and protective
                controls associated with its Environmental Protection Program as
                being Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;3.2 - Operational Control-Upset or Abnormal
                Operating Conditions
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that its Environmental
                Protection Program staff plays a role in supporting the
                Emergency Management Program by fulfilling and being trained on
                various technical roles within the Incident Command Structure
                framework. As a result, the Board views this process as being
                Compliant in meeting its expectations for this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.3 - Management of Change</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada has implemented some aspects of a Management of
                Change process. However, TransCanada did not demonstrate that it
                has established and implemented a process for proactively
                identifying and managing any change that could affect safety,
                security or protection of the environment. This includes any new
                hazard or risk, any change in design, specification or standard
                or procedure and any change in the company’s organizational
                structure or applicable legal requirements.&nbsp; As a result,
                the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this
                sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Sub-element&nbsp;3.4 - Training, Competence and Evaluation
              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada was able to demonstrate that it invested a
                significant amount of resources in developing and implementing a
                formal training process. However, it was not able to demonstrate
                that it has effectively established and implemented processes
                for developing and verifying competency requirements in order to
                ensure the protection of the environment. As a result, the Board
                finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.5 - Communication</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated appropriate, ongoing communication
                practices, procedures and activities between TransCanada and its
                external stakeholders. However, it did not demonstrate the
                communication of environmental Non-Compliances (in particular
                Board Non-Compliances) vertically and horizontally across the
                organization in order to prevent reoccurrences of the same
                issue. As a result, the Board finds TransCanada to be
                Non-Compliant with this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;3.6 - Documentation and Document Control</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established and implemented
                a process for the development, revision and management of
                operational procedures. However, it was not able to demonstrate
                that other pertinent Environmental Protection Program documents
                (design standards, manuals, etc.) being used across the
                organization were periodically reviewed and revised to ensure
                its adequacy and effectiveness. As a result, the Board finds
                TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with this sub-element.

              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated established processes for inspecting
                and monitoring its activities and facilities in order to
                evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of its Environmental
                Protection Program. However, it could not demonstrate that these
                processes are being consistently implemented as records provided
                to the Board were either not provided or incomplete. As a
                result, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element.

              </h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has a process in place to
                identify, track, analyze and resolve issues and incidents
                throughout its Incident and Issue Management Program that
                reflects the Board’s expectations for this sub-element. As a
                result, the Board views these processes as being Compliant in
                meeting its expectations for this sub-element.
              </p>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;4.3 - Internal Audit</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that its quality assurance program is
                implemented on a scale that exceeds the Board’s expectations
                with respect to frequency. However, the audits focused on
                conformance to internal requirements rather than compliance with
                statutory requirements. There was also a lack of guidance to
                enable senior management to prioritize and manage corrective and
                preventive actions for deficiencies identified in audits. As a
                result, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element.

              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it has established effective
                processes for generating, retaining, and maintaining records
                that document the implementation of its Environmental Protection
                Program, and for providing access to those who require them. As
                a result, the Board views these processes as meeting its
                expectations, and finds TransCanada to Complaint with this
                sub-element.
              </p>
              <h3>Element&nbsp;5.0 - Management Review</h3>
              <h4>Sub-element&nbsp;5.1 - Management Review</h4>
              <p>
                TransCanada demonstrated that it is undertaking a significant
                number of management review activities consistent with the
                descriptions included in its internal Health Safety &amp;
                Environment Framework document. However, TransCanada did not
                demonstrate that it has a documented and comprehensive process
                for conducting a consistent management review of the
                Environmental Protection Program and for ensuring continual
                improvement as described in the Board’s expectations. As a
                result, the Board finds TransCanada to be Non-Compliant with
                this sub-element.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate effective and implemented Management
                Systems into their day-to-day operations. These programs include
                the tools, technologies and actions needed to ensure that
                pipelines are safe and remain that way over time. Environmental
                Protection Programs enable pipeline companies to ensure
                environmental hazards are identified, mitigated and managed
                throughout the life cycle of the pipeline system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit has identified that TransCanada has developed
                and implemented an internal program to manage and control the
                environmental hazards associated with its facilities, processes
                and activities. The documents and records reviewed during this
                audit also demonstrate that TransCanada is ensuring that company
                personnel and contractors are appropriately informed and/or
                trained in environmental protection practices and procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s management demonstrated that the company has
                resourced the Environmental Protection Program and has involved
                itself in implementation and oversight at senior management
                levels. TransCanada has also demonstrated that it has
                established an appropriate inspection and monitoring program to
                ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of its Environmental
                Protection Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding this, the audit has also identified areas of
                Non-Compliance with NEB requirements. The Board concludes that a
                majority of the Non-Compliant findings fall into three general
                categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the lack of documented, established and implemented 
                  processes  that correspond with the Management System
                  requirements as required by the OPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the insufficient development and implementation of effective
                  processes related to ongoing, internal evaluation of the
                  compliance to legal requirements, and the adequacy and
                  effectiveness of its Environmental Protection Program; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  the inability to demonstrate full implementation of existing
                  processes.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that while no enforcement actions are
                immediately required to address these non-compliant findings, as
                per the Board’s standard audit practice, TransCanada must
                develop and submit a corrective action plan describing its
                proposed methods to resolve the non-compliances identified and
                the timeline in which corrective actions will be completed.
                TransCanada will be required to submit its corrective action
                plan for approval within 30&nbsp;days of the final Audit Report
                being issued by the Board. The Board will make its final Audit
                Report and TransCanada’s approved corrective action plan public
                on the Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will assess the implementation of all of TransCanada’s
                corrective actions to confirm they are completed in a timely
                manner and on a system wide basis until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of TransCanada’s Environmental
                Protection Program and management system as a whole through
                targeted compliance verification activities as a part of its
                ongoing regulatory mandate.

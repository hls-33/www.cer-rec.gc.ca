          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Westcoast senior management participates in several committees that
            oversee the development and implementation of the policies that
            frame the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Program. For the
            purposes of this audit, the Crossings Program is considered to be
            subsumed in the Safety Program. Westcoast management communicates
            the policy for EHS programs through an Operational Steering
            Committee. The EHS Policy is signed off by Spectra Energy’s
            President and Chief Executive Officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Policy was available at all sites and staff interviews confirmed
            that employees are aware of its existence. A review of the Policy
            from the 2012 purpose statement is as follows:<br />
            “To achieve our purpose we manage risk in everything we do, by
            continuously improving on
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Employee, contractor and vehicle safety;</li>
            <li>Process safety;</li>
            <li>Environmental Management;</li>
            <li>Reliability; and</li>
            <li>Cost management.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While Westcoast was able to demonstrate that its Policy is signed
            off by senior management and communicated to employees, the audit
            found that “public safety” is not mentioned in the Policy. While it
            is understood that public safety is achieved when the goals listed
            are reached, the NEB Act and associated regulations clearly separate
            the safety of the public as a requirement.

            Administrative assistants conduct the initial screening of crossing
            requests that are submitted through the One-Call system. Operations
            supplied them with criteria such as parameters for vehicle load
            versus amount of cover. For activity applications that are in closer
            proximity to the pipeline, they open a file and pass the “in
            conflict” requests to the Lands department for further evaluation.
            Depending on the level of expertise required to review the
            application based on factors such as proximity to the pipe and the
            nature of the request, the applications are addressed by either the
            Lands or Operations teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hazard identification for third party crossing activity is
            incorporated and captured in the permitting process and outlined in
            the related documentation. The Land and Crossing Administrator
            assesses the application using information and formulas provided on
            the Source (Westcoast’s internal intranet site). Based on the
            assessment, they forward on the applications that require
            engineering assessments. All crossing requests are administered with
            permits. These permits include the instructions for conducting the
            work as well as the safety and contact information. The Lands and
            Damage Prevention groups also work with the Public Awareness group
            to identify and address potentially hazardous activities, such as
            deep tillage. Once identified, the groups work on a strategy to
            address the hazard with awareness activities or alterations to
            permit templates and information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it has implemented a hazard
            identification process that is incorporated into its processing and
            administration of third party crossing applications. As well, the
            Damage Prevention and Lands groups work with the Public Awareness
            group in the identification of potentially hazardous activities.

            The company shall have a verifiable process for the identification

            protection programs. The company should have a documented procedure
            to identify and resolve non-compliances as they relate to legal
            requirements which includes updating the management and protection
            programs as required.

            Westcoast monitors legal requirements through a subscription to
            Templegate Information Services Inc. and Cyber Regs, as well as
            membership in professional organizations such as CEPA and the
            Canadian Common Ground Alliance. Westcoast’s Regulatory Affairs
            group communicates regulatory changes via email to a list of group
            leads. It is then up to the recipients on the distribution list to
            identify any changes that are relevant to their respective
            operational processes. For example, according to staff, it was the
            Regulatory Affairs office that ensured that Westcoast complied with
            the Exemption Order Respecting Crossings by Agricultural Vehicles or
            Mobile Equipment (NEB M0-21-2010). Document review also demonstrated
            that regulatory references are identified in some Standard Operating
            Procedures (SOPs).
          </p>
          <p>
            While the company was able to demonstrate that communication of
            regulatory requirements is occurring, and that personnel are
            incorporating new requirements into some of the procedures and
            templates, Westcoast did not demonstrate that there is an inventory
            of legal requirements or a formal process to verify whether the
            Damage Prevention and Crossing Programs are meeting all of the legal
            requirements.

            The company should have goals, objectives and quantifiable targets
            relevant to the risks and hazards associated with the company’s
            facilities and activities (i.e. construction, operations and
            maintenance). The objectives and targets should be measurable and
            consistent with the Policy and legal requirements and ideally
            include continual improvement and prevention initiatives, where
            appropriate.

            Westcoast sets goals at various levels of the organization. At the
            corporate level, set goals often include issues related to safety
            and operations. For example, one of this year’s corporate goals was
            for 100% of staff to complete the core safety training by 31 October
            2012. Westcoast staff goals and targets are developed, in part, to
            reflect the corporate ones such as completing safety training. Goals
            and targets for employees are established in staff development plans
            then managed and tracked through performance management and tied to
            the organization-wide Short-term Incentive Pay (STIP) program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the Lands and Damage Prevention groups, goals are established
            related to business and process improvements as well as meeting
            regulatory requirements. For example, following the issuance of NEB
            MO-21-2010, a depth of cover survey was included among staff goals
            for the year. The Lands and Damage Prevention groups also report the
            number of unauthorized activities to the Operations group to be
            included among its Key Performance Indicators. These teams work
            closely with the Public Awareness Teams in order to identify new
            potential audiences or hazardous activities. Document review
            confirmed that goals and targets are established relating to the
            Public Awareness Program staff and activity development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that there is a process for
            establishing goals, targets and objectives for its Lands and Damage
            Prevention Programs, and that related issues are monitored and
            measured, and used to form the basis of the plan going forward.
            Within the Lands and Damage Prevention groups, goals are established
            for the related programs annually and these goals contribute to
            staff performance reviews.

            The Team Leader, Public Awareness, Team Leader, Crossing
            Administration and Damage Prevention and the Manager of Lands, Field
            Operations all report to the Lands and Pipeline Safety Director. The
            third party crossing permits are managed in the Crossing
            Administration and Damage Prevention Team. The staff who manages and
            performs third party locates reports through the Manager of Lands,
            Field Operations. This team has staff in Vancouver, Fort St John and
            Prince George, BC, as well as contract workers in various locations
            around BC. The Team Leaders conduct annual reviews to discuss
            performance, goals and targets. The Team Leaders review the workload
            with the Director during their quarterly reporting.

            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it has a functioning
            structure to maintain the program as designed. With all of the third
            party contact points managed under one team, communication among the
            groups contributes to the ongoing functioning of all programs.

            Management of Change (MOC) related to Lands and Crossings is managed
            out of Vancouver, British Columbia and MOC for asset changes is
            managed at local facilities. Its current MOC program has scoped in
            Public Awareness as a group that needs to be notified and evaluated
            for potential impacts when there are changes involving the assets,
            such as databases. The MOC Descriptions of Affected Applications,
            Systems, Documentation and Processes, describes the circumstances
            for involving the Public Awareness Program in the MOC. Review of the
            documentation provided indicates that the triggers for MOC and the
            Public Awareness Program mainly involve the Geographical Information
            System (GIS). While it is understood that changes to the GIS system
            database should be managed, it is not clear what other types of
            changes at Westcoast would trigger the MOC process and when the
            Lands or Damage Prevention Teams would be notified and considered in
            that change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interviews confirmed that Westcoast is in the process of developing
            and implementing an Operations Management System (OMS). Westcoast
            indicated that it intends to incorporate the MOC process into the
            OMS. Interviews indicated that public safety measures such as damage
            prevention and lands related matters had yet to be included in the
            scope as triggers for the new MOC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there are aspects of a functioning asset- based MOC process
            in place, and improvements are planned, at the time of the audit,
            Westcoast failed to demonstrate that it has implemented a
            comprehensive MOC process that includes the appropriate triggers to
            include the Lands and Damage Prevention groups.

            The Land Services Administrator tracks training for all employees in
            the Lands and Pipeline Safety Awareness Team using a Learning
            Management System (LMS) database. The training records for the Lands
            staff are managed in LMS by administrative staff in the Vancouver
            office. Expiration dates are put on required courses for Westcoast
            staff and the system sends out email alerts three months before the
            training has expired. Interviews confirmed that employees in the
            field offices were aware of LMS and the online courses available in
            that database.
          </p>
          <p>
            All mandatory training is entered in the LMS database. Once leaders
            have met with staff to determine learning and development plans, all
            additional training is also included in the LMS. For instance, the
            Damage Prevention Team Leader requires her team to take Ground
            Disturbance level I and II training. This course is entered in the
            LMS and the training records are managed there. Other training is
            managed within the performance management and professional
            development process in Career Zone. For example, although there are
            no formal requirements for the Land Agents to have a professional
            designation, all current Land Agents are enrolled in International
            Right of Way Association (IRWA) courses in pursuit of the IRWA
            designation. While all Lands staff is subject to reviews and
            evaluations, contract land agents are not subject to the same
            reviews to ensure that they are performing in accordance with
            Westcoast standards and procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            While employees in the Damage Prevention and Lands Team are trained
            and evaluated on a regular basis, Westcoast could not demonstrate
            that there is a process in place to evaluate its contractors who
            conduct third party locates as required by CSA&nbsp;Z662-11.

            Organization wide safety related communication takes place during
            mandatory safety stand down meetings and monthly mandatory safety
            meetings which are delivered to all sites simultaneously. There are
            also less formal town hall meetings to discuss safety topics which
            include third party issues such as call before you dig issues and
            agricultural practices. Employees also receive weekly safety reports
            by email that are posted on the Source and emails from Public
            Affairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of the Damage Prevention and Lands Teams provide the Director
            with weekly reports on workload and issues related to workload.
            Communication also takes place with related teams. For example, Land
            Agents attend weekly meetings with Operations to discuss potential
            land issues prior to any Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) work.

            other related trade shows to discuss general safety practices and
            regulatory requirements for working around federally regulated
            pipelines. They also place ads with safety messages in trade
            journals and community newsletters. The external website also
            contains readily available safety and contact information for
            landowners and other third parties. Communication with potential
            crossers occurs throughout the permitting process in order to ensure
            a complete permit. The Damage Prevention and Crossing Administration
            team includes the company’s written permission as well as the
            instructions for working near the pipeline such as whether or not a
            Westcoast employee has to be onsite during the work.

          <p>
            The Lands Team communicates with landowners regarding any O&amp;M
            work that Operations has determined is required. Westcoast has
            contractors in the North East BC area to perform locates for third
            parties. To communicate with landowners regarding O&amp;M projects,
            they provide a company contact. Any landowner issues or complaints
            are managed through the issue resolution process.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            The Lands team participates in the right of way (ROW) inspections.
            Each section of the Westcoast system is inspected by helicopter
            monthly to monitor for unauthorized activity and potential
            environmental issues. In order to ensure that issues are identified,
            staff follows set criteria for the aerial inspections. In areas
            where Westcoast shares a ROW with Pembina, the companies alternate
            monthly aerial patrols and report accordingly. Interviews confirm
            that the Lands group attends the aerial ROW patrols and submits the
            reports regarding the state of signage, any unauthorized activity or
            encroachments noted, as well as the state of vegetation. Signage is
            maintained on an ongoing, as-required basis to ensure it is legible
            and visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it has processes and
            procedures in place for the surveillance and monitoring of its ROW.

          <p>
            The company shall have a process to investigate incidents or any
            non-compliance that may occur. The company shall have a process to
            mitigate any potential or actual issues arising from such incidents
            or non-compliances. Such mitigation may include appropriate timing
            and actions for addressing the issues that arise. The company shall
            demonstrate that it has established a documented procedure to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>set criteria for non-compliance;</li>
            <li>identify the occurrence of any non-compliances;</li>

          <p>
            Westcoast has developed and implemented procedures for addressing
            the reporting requirements for unauthorized activities outlined in
            the PCR. Reporting templates are maintained by the Damage Prevention
            Team and available to all employees on the Source. All unauthorized
            activities are entered in the Incident Tracking Database to be
            managed until addressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Damage Prevention Team is responsible for reporting these events
            to the Board as well as following up with the third parties. The
            Damage Prevention Team enters the unauthorized activity reports into
            the GIS database to link them to the section of ROW. The Damage
            Prevention Team also communicates with the Public Awareness Team in
            order to correlate awareness activities and unauthorized activities
            when appropriate. The Lands Team members are located throughout the
            province and can be involved when onsite follow-up and investigation
            is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it has a process to identify
            and respond to unauthorized activities, and that staff are aware of
            their roles regarding reporting and follow-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also a well-established feedback loop to analyze the
            events, and identify deficiencies and appropriate follow-up.

          <p>
            Westcoast maintains several databases related to the programs under
            the Director of Lands and Pipeline Safety. For third party crossing
            and damage prevention, related files and records are stored in the
            GIS database according to standards established by the Lands group.
            All records related to any third party crossing file are uploaded to
            GIS and available to all staff. Staff at all locations has read
            access to all of the layers of information. It is used to obtain a
            current snapshot, as well as a history of activity at a specific
            location. For instance, staff uses the GIS database to access
            records regarding O&amp;M activities, unauthorized activities, as
            well as permits granted to the same piece of property along the ROW.
            The system has several layers of data entered so it is useful for
            many teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            A review of the database entries showed that Westcoast enters all
            related permit applications, permits, correspondence, unauthorized
            activities, landowner complaints by the GIS coordinates. The result
            is that staff can obtain information as it relates to a particular
            section of its ROW.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it has implemented and
            maintained appropriate records management in accordance with the
            legal requirements.

            The company shall develop and implement a documented process to
            undertake audits of its management and protection programs and
            procedures. The audit process should identify and manage the
            training and competency requirements for staff carrying out the

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Senior management of Spectra Audit Services is located in Houston,
            Texas. However, an audit manager and several staff are located in
            Calgary, Alberta. Calgary-based audit staff perform most of the
            Westcoast internal audits, sometimes with participation by
            Houston-based audit staff. The audits against program requirements
            occur on a regular basis and vary in size and scope. Interviews and
            document review confirm that all non-compliant findings are tracked,
            assigned to staff for completion, and reported to upper management.
          </p>
          <p>
            While other operational programs are routinely reviewed, interviews
            confirmed that the Lands and Pipeline Safety Programs have not yet
            been included in an operational audit done by the audit team out of
            Houston. Also, according to staff there are no formal reviews of the
            Lands and Damage Prevention Programs to ensure that they are
            developed and maintained in accordance with the legal requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was not able to demonstrate that the requirements of the
            PCR have been scoped into any internal operational audits. Also, it
            did not demonstrate that the requirements of the PCR are included in
            its audit protocols for the audits regarding safety of the public in
            order to confirm compliance.

            Senior management should formally review the management and

            effectiveness. The review should be based on appropriate
            documentation and records including the results of the surveillance,
            monitoring and audit programs. This review should be formal and
            documented and should occur on a regular basis. The management
            review should include a review of any decisions, actions and
            commitments which relate to the improvement of the programs and the
            company’s overall performance.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            According to staff, the Public Awareness, Lands and Damage
            Prevention Teams report results to the Director of Lands and
            Pipeline Safety. These reports form the basis for the programs going
            forward and are also discussed during performance reviews.
            Interviews with Senior Management confirm that reports of
            unauthorized activity trends are discussed at a senior management
            level. These reports are synthesized into management’s overall
            safety and performance reporting. Management from head office also
            conducts mandatory safety stand down meetings which often address
            topics related to third party damage prevention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Senior management receives reports regarding the performance of the
            damage prevention related programs and includes public safety and
            damage prevention topics in its regular communications. While the
            Board acknowledges that there is communication occurring, Westcoast
            was unable to demonstrate that it has established the required
            processes that contribute to an adequate management review. As noted
            in element 2.2 of this report, Westcoast does not have a formal
            process of confirming that there is a current and complete inventory
            of legal requirements guiding the development and implementation of
            its Crossing program. Also, Westcoast’s internal audit process does
            not include an evaluation of compliance to the PCR which outline the
            requirements for addressing third party activities. Without this
            confirmation of compliance, senior management cannot verify that the
            Crossing program is operating in compliance with all of the
            requirements. As well, Westcoast’s policy and purpose statement does
            not explicitly include public safety, and so there is no clear line
            of sight from Westcoast’s policy to the Crossings Program. Therefore
            the Board is not satisfied that there are sufficient processes in
            place by senior management to allow for a formal and documented
            management review to ensure ongoing suitability of the Crossings
            Program.

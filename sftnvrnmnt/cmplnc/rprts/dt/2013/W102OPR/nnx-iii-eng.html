            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it has an adequate and
            up-to-date corporate Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy
            that meets the Board’s expectations. The Policy statement and
            accompanying documentation outline Westcoast’s management principles
            and clear program objectives. The Environmental Protection Program
            (EPP) is guided by these documents.

            the rationale for including or excluding possible risks in regard to
            its environment, safety, integrity, crossings and awareness and
            emergency management and protection programs (management and
            protection programs). The company should be able to implement
            control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Through its EPP documents and records, as well as interviews with
            staff, Westcoast was not able to demonstrate that it had met the
            Board’s requirements with respect to this sub-element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it had identified some of its
            environmental hazards and aspects; however, in reviewing the
            documents provided, it would appear that the items identified and
            managed formally were, for the most part, limited to the
            requirements stated in its provincial operating permits.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the audit, Westcoast was unable to demonstrate that an active
            inventory of environmental hazards and aspects exists nor provide a
            procedure to proactively identify and manage new environmental
            hazards and aspects as they arise. During interviews with staff, the
            company indicated that environmental hazards and aspects are also
            identified through pre-job and ground disturbance checklists,
            incidents, and by reviewing new legislative requirements. Similarly,
            company staff interviewed indicated that, as part of their annual
            business planning, an informal risk analysis based on staff
            knowledge is completed on known areas of potential environmental
            concern.
          </p>
          <p>
            While all of these sub-processes of the EPP contribute to the aspect
            identification process, they are also all reactionary and may
            preclude environmental hazards and aspects from being identified.

          <h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>
          <h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
          <h4>Expectations:</h4>
          <p>
            The company shall have a verifiable process for the identification
            and integration of legal requirements into its management and
            protection programs. The company should have a documented procedure
            to identify and resolve non-compliances as they relate to legal
            requirements that include updating the management and protection
            programs as required.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Review of Westcoast’s process for the identification and integration
            of its legal requirements indicated that the company’s processes did
            not meet the Board’s expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interviews with staff indicated that the company has contracts with
            several external providers in order to identify changes to
            legislative requirements. Reviews of these changes are completed by
            the company’s legal department and by the various subject matter
            experts. Any changes to legal requirements and their implications
            are discussed at the weekly Operations Management Team (OMT) and
            Area Management Team (AMT) meetings and, if deemed significant, are
            elevated to senior management through the Operations Steering
            Committee (OSC).
          </p>
          <p>
            Through several internal tracking mechanisms, Westcoast staff
            provided records listing its legal requirements at various levels of
            detail. For example, an inventory of provincial permit environmental
            requirements were outlined and monitored in detail, whereas other
            inventories provided either had legislative requirements that were
            excluded (e.g., Part 8 of OPR-99) or discussed only at a very high
            level. Other than ensuring that reporting deadlines are being met,
            the company did not demonstrate how these legislative requirements
            were being integrated into its EPP. It was also unclear how or if
            these legal inventories provided are maintained to ensure that they
            are current.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of particular note was the lack of description related to the NEB
            OPR-99 EPP requirements and a similar lack in expectations that
            could be used in the development and evaluation of Westcoast’s
            Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), as well as audit, inspection
            and investigation processes. As the Board’s regulations are process
            and outcome focused, a clear interpretation and description of the
            requirements in relation to Westcoast’s facilities and associated
            activities is required to ensure compliance.
          </p>

          <h3 id="s2_3">2.3 Goals, Objectives and Targets</h3>
          <h4>Expectations:</h4>
          <p>
            The company should have goals, objectives and quantifiable targets
            relevant to the risks and hazards associated with the company’s
            facilities and activities (i.e., construction, operations and
            maintenance). The objectives and targets should be measurable and
            consistent with the Policy and legal requirements and ideally
            include continual improvement and prevention initiatives, where
            appropriate.

          <p>
            Westcoast was able to demonstrate compliance with this sub-element
            through documentation and records provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Company staff provided records indicating that, on an annual basis,
            senior management sets corporate goals, objectives and targets for
            the company that are applied and measured at each management unit on
            an on-going basis. The results are collected, measured and monitored
            by senior management as a monthly operational performance metric
            referred to as the SET-West OSC Monthly Scorecard (Scorecard).
            Interviews with company senior management indicated that off-site
            meetings occur throughout the year to formally discuss performance
            to date and implement corrective actions where required. General
            Managers and EHS advisors across the Spectra corporation also meet
            annually to discuss existing goals, objectives and targets as well
            as discuss what areas should be focused on for the upcoming year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast staff indicated that senior management has identified
            seven program areas for measurement and improvement and have set
            what they would consider to be aggressive goals for improvement in
            these areas. One such area includes environmental performance and
            appears to relate back to the corporate Policy and purpose
            statements. Measures being tracked that may have environmental
            considerations include non-compliance with provincial permits,
            spills and releases, and public complaints. Through the Short-Term
            Incentive Pay (STIP) Program, Westcoast has also established
            performance measures/targets for the various teams to achieve. Of
            note, permit non-compliances are one such measure; however, NEB
            non-compliances are not included in this program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of particular note was that NEB Assurances of Voluntary Compliance
            (AVCs) are currently being tracked on the Scorecard; however, no
            targets for continual improvement have been established. Board
            Inspection Officer Orders and Board Orders are not tracked on the
            Scorecard and therefore it is unclear whether senior management is
            being made aware of such enforcement measures. As an example, a
            Board Inspection Officer Order was issued to Westcoast in September
            2012; however, there is no record of this enforcement measure being
            discussed at any of the senior management level meetings (Weekly OSC
            or Bi-Monthly Audit Review Meetings). As the Board expects that
            goals, objectives and targets be developed based on risk and
            hazards, and not the amount of non-compliances they incur, the
            company is in compliance with this sub-element. See also sub-element

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Through interviews as well as document and record review, Westcoast
            was able to demonstrate that all staff with environmental
            responsibilities have clear role and responsibility statements
            applicable to their positions within the environmental or
            organizational structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company, however, was not able to demonstrate that it had an
            organizational structure that would allow its EPP to effectively
            function. Board inspections conducted prior to both the audit and
            interviews, as well as records and documents reviewed during the
            audit, indicate that some of the findings and non-compliances noted
            in this appendix could relate to having too few frontline
            environmental staff available to support operations staff in
            ensuring compliance with the Board’s expectations. This support
            could be achieved by conducting internal inspections, providing
            training, and through process or procedural development. For
            example, it was indicated during interviews that environmental staff
            are not formally involved with the development, review or
            implementation of the various SOPs for the Westcoast system. As some
            of the SOPs have significant environmental considerations (e.g., the
            Pipeline Right-of-Way Inspection SOP), by not having environmental
            staff formally engaged, it is possible that some of the
            environmental aspects and/or issues are being overlooked. It was
            indicated that records from these inspections are not formally
            communicated with environmental staff. See also sub-element 3.4
            Communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, some of the facilities within the area of
            responsibility of the local environmental specialists have not been
            inspected on an appropriate or regular basis. Interviews with
            various staff members indicated that this was related to having too
            large of an area of responsibility for the environmental staff. As
            an example, the audit identified one environmental specialist is
            currently responsible for the entire Westcoast Transmission system
            which runs from Fort Nelson to Huntington, BC (approximately
            2000&nbsp;km of right-of-way and associated facilities). Further,
            Board inspections conducted in conjunction with this audit
            identified environmental issues that could be considered routine,
            but had remained unmitigated for a long time. An example of this is
            the Assurance of Voluntary Compliance received from the company with
            respect to oil staining. The Board inspector noted, among other
            things, significant and other small areas of staining adjacent to a
            decommissioned compressor building. It was suggested by company
            staff that this staining likely occurred while the compressor was
            active and appears to have been continually overlooked by operations
            staff. Interviews with various staff indicated that the right-of-way
            and facility inspections do not routinely include the environmental
            staff because of workload issues nor are the staff available to
            train the facility inspectors. As noted, many of the issues
            identified in the Board’s inspections could be considered routine or
            standard practice issues, had been on-going for some time and should
            have been identified by an adequate inspection program. See also
            sub-element 4.1 Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast indicated that a formal organization review of the EHS
            &amp; Operations Services groups was completed in 2012. This review
            did result in realigning the EHS from the Vice President (VP)
            Operations to a new VP, EHS &amp; Risk Management. The Board sees
            this as an improvement in the organizational structure as it will
            promote better oversight, improve impartiality and remove local
            influence in decision making and reporting of issues. However,
            review of the documentation provided on this organizational review
            indicated that this review was focused on the appropriate management
            structure and did not consider whether there were adequate resources
            for their EPP to effectively function.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Westcoast demonstrated that it has a formal process and dedicated
            staff for managing changes to its assets. However, Westcoast’s
            management of change (MOC) process, as demonstrated, is not
            considered compliant as it applies only to physical (asset) changes
            and not to changes required in practices or procedures that could
            result from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>changes to legal requirements;</li>
            <li>changes to industry standards or practices;</li>
            <li>the identification of new hazards; or</li>
            <li>results of monitoring, inspections or investigations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Further, Westcoast’s MOC process only manages changes on a reactive
            basis (i.e., changes once the need has been identified). The Board’s
            expectation is that company MOC processes be proactive and include
            requirements for the identification of changes that could affect the
            management and protection programs (e.g., Integrity, Safety,
            Environmental Protection, Emergency Management, etc.).

          <p>
            Although Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it invested a
            significant amount of resources in developing and implementing a
            formal training process, the company was not able to demonstrate
            full compliance with the Board’s training and competency
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through documentation and record review, and during interviews with
            staff, the company demonstrated that it has dedicated training staff
            that have developed a formalized training process within its
            Operations Management System. The process involves formal
            identification, assignment and monitoring of training requirements.
            The training program involves competency-based training and
            evaluation, where applicable. These formal processes and practices
            were appropriate in managing a training program to meet the Board’s
            requirements. Interviews also indicated that supervisors complete
            annual technical competency assessments of their environmental
            staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the company was not able to demonstrate compliance was with
            respect to environmental training for operations staff, contractor
            competency evaluation and the maintenance of environmental training
            for the company’s environmental professionals.
          </p>
          <p>
            During interviews throughout the organization, company staff
            identified that operations staff received training in regard to
            environmental aspects and controls as part of their on-boarding (new
            staff orientation) process. This training is required to be renewed
            every three years and is tracked annually as a STIP performance
            measure. As part of the document review process, Westcoast provided
            copies of its various SOPs for the Westcoast system that include
            environmental controls. Operations staff that were interviewed
            indicated that mentorship arrangements are established to ensure the
            appropriate training of inexperienced staff. A formal sign-off from
            senior staff would occur upon completion of each training module to
            ensure competence in that particular task. However, as there is no
            formal evaluation of senior staff to ensure their competency with
            environmental controls, and it was indicated that some senior staff
            may have been “grandfathered” from a training perspective, Westcoast
            could not demonstrate that staff remain current in their required
            training.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to the assurance of contractor competence, Westcoast
            staff indicated that this is being managed and assured by a third
            party service provider, ISNetworld (ISN) on its behalf. The
            interview indicated that ISN primarily manages safety histories,
            insurance and workman’s compensation issues of contractors.
            Westcoast was therefore unable to demonstrate how it ensures the
            competency of its contractors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, companies should also demonstrate that they have
            practices to ensure that their professional staff remain current and
            competent in their areas of expertise. Interviews conducted
            indicated that the company expectation is for staff to obtain or
            maintain professional designation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, it was stated repeatedly that the organization is supportive
            of staff attending conferences, workshop and/or other professional
            development activities; however, due to time availability, some of
            the environmental staff have not been able to participate in these
            learning opportunities.

            this appendix, results from inspections (e.g., aerial, on the

            formally shared with environmental staff. This transfer of
            information, whether positive or negative, would assist in
            confirming the environmental program is effective and could identify

            environmental effects associated with upset or abnormal operating
            conditions of its operating processes. The formal procedures,
            including emergency management, that have been developed included
            the high-risk hazards that should be addressed. Similarly, Westcoast
            was able to demonstrate that its staff were being trained and were
            implementing the procedures and practices as described in the
            documents. Further, it was noted that environmental-related
            processes and procedures included practices to be implemented if
            abnormal or upset conditions were detected or were occurring.

            Westcoast was not able to demonstrate compliance with the Board’s
            expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the audit, company staff indicated that there are a number of
            formal and informal ways that Westcoast inspects and monitors its
            right-of-way and associated facilities. These include aerial
            fly-overs, pigging station inspections, ground disturbance
            activities, senior management and other committee tours, and general
            site walk-throughs.

          <p>
            Document and record review, as well as interviews with staff,
            indicated that Westcoast had developed and implemented appropriate
            monitoring and inspection practices and procedures for ensuring the
            safe operation of its pipeline and associated facilities. However,
            as noted elsewhere in this appendix, interviews with staff, and
            document review confirmed that the company has not developed or
            implemented an appropriate process for conducting the environmental
            portion of these inspections. The audit identified that
            environmental staff are not routinely involved in the inspection of
            the pipeline system nor do they routinely participate in the
            training of staff whose role it is to complete them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, interviews with environmental staff indicated that there is
            no set frequency or formal requirement to conduct internal
            environment inspections. Some sites are elevated to a higher
            inspection frequency (quarterly) due to historical issues; however,
            no records of these inspections are documented nor is there a
            checklist for staff to use to ensure consistency.

          <p>
            The company shall have a process to investigate incidents or any
            non-compliance that may occur. The company shall have a process to
            mitigate any potential or actual issues arising from such incidents
            or non-compliances. Such mitigation may include appropriate timing
            and actions for addressing the issues that arise. The company shall

            While all records requested were readily retrieved, it was indicated
            during interviews that the company lacked a formalized process for
            email correspondence retention. The company has established that all
            unfiled emails will be deleted after three months and those that
            have been moved to a folder are deleted after two years. Individual
            staff have established their personal method in ensuring that these
            records are maintained; however, the Board is concerned that,
            without a formal filing process, certain email correspondence which
            contain compliance information may be deleted and not easily
            accessible in the event of an investigation.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            During the audit, the company demonstrated that it has two processes
            for conducting audits of its facilities. These processes were
            implemented by staff from Calgary, Alberta or in its head office in
            Houston, Texas. Interviews with the company indicated that the
            internal audits are completed to confirm program compliance and
            would not necessarily confirm legislative compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the audit, the company provided copies of internal audits
            conducted by its Houston-based EHS auditing group. Review of the
            internal audit records indicated that an appropriate process had
            been developed for conducting the audit and managing the results
            through to implementation of the corrective action plans for noted
            deficiencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The audit process did not, however, meet the requirements contained
            in OPR-99. OPR-99 requires that audits be undertaken to ensure
            compliance with relevant portions of the National Energy Board Act,
            the regulations, any terms and conditions of any certificate or
            order issued by the Board and the company’s EPP. Review of the
            company protocols indicated that the audit did not meet these
            requirements. The audit protocols and results did not contain
            itemized lists of the regulatory or certificate requirements, nor
            did they contain appropriate audit definitions of the National
            Energy Board’s outcome-based program requirements to evaluate
            against.

            Senior management should formally review the management and

            Interviews and record reviews indicate that the EPP undergoes
            regular review by Westcoast’s area management, operations management
            and senior management teams. Westcoast’s senior management also
            holds meetings on a regular basis at different field locations to
            evaluate the operations of the pipeline and associated facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Board acknowledges the amount of review of the EPP by
            Westcoast senior management, based on the non-compliances identified
            in sub-elements&nbsp;3.1 and 4.4, the Board is not satisfied that
            management review has been undertaken with a view to ensuring the
            EPP’s continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The Board
            expects senior management to ensure and demonstrate that there are
            appropriate human resources to operate its pipeline system. Further,
            the Board is of the view that senior management is responsible to
            ensure that the EPP is audited and internal inspections are
            completed on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            As referenced early in this appendix, significant effort has been
            put forth by senior management to track and measure performance
            related to permit non-compliances. This includes having this measure
            built into the company’s performance pay system (STIP). Board AVCs
            have since been added to the company scorecard; however, no targets
            have been established for which the company can measure performance.
            Board or Inspection Officer Orders are not tracked, nor could
            Westcoast demonstrate in the audit that these enforcement actions
            are discussed at the senior management level.

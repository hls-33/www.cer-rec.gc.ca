            Westcoast has an Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy which
            has been approved and adopted by Spectra Energy Transmission’s
            president and chief executive officer. This EHS Policy serves as the
            foundation for all Westcoast activities by establishing a clear
            vision of EHS performance shared by the organization. The EHS Policy
            has been defined by senior management to demonstrate Westcoast’s
            commitment to the protection of the environment, and the health and
            safety of its employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The EHS Policy is applicable throughout the EHS Management System
            (MS), which has been designed and implemented to ensure the five
            principles (Accountability, Stewardship, Standards, Performance and
            Communication) of the EHS Policy are achieved on a day-to-day basis.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Document review determined that Westcoast has an established
            EHS&nbsp;MS. In 2009, Westcoast expanded its EHS&nbsp;MS to include
            a Hazard Management Program (HMP) which includes an Occupational
            Exposure Management Program as well as a task hazard analysis
            mechanism. The HMP also includes the development of a Critical Task
            Analysis Risk Evaluation Tool, a Workplace Exposure Assessment and
            Control Lists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The HMP involves characterizing and ranking the relative risk of
            worker and/or company hazards for all Westcoast Similar Exposure
            Groups (SEG). SEGs are groups of workers that have the same general
            exposure profiles because of the similarity and frequency of the
            tasks they perform, the materials and processes with which they
            work, and the similarity in the way they perform the tasks. SEGs are
            broken down by: (1) operating area; (2) job description; and (3) job
            tasks (including job tasks that utilize contractors).
          </p>
          <p>
            A Westcoast standard is in place for each critical practice (e.g.,
            working at heights, lockout/tag out, ground disturbances, confined
            space and sour work). The Westcoast Critical Practice Standards are
            reviewed by the Health and Safety Department every three years to
            ensure supervisors and workers receive relevant job-specific
            training. According to Westcoast staff, the goal of critical
            practice standards is to allow staff to develop the ability and
            skill to see beyond the usual concerns of any given task into
            possible side effects and consequences. Westcoast has integrated
            this program training requirement for each critical practice along
            with recommended training tracked in Westcoast’s Learning Management
            System (LMS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast has developed a Self-Assessment Program. This program
            includes an updated inspection form available on the Westcoast
            intranet site (called the Source) which directs the observer to
            assess area conditions rather than assess specific hazards. A
            corrective action plan is also included with the updated form. Local
            Area Leadership delivered presentations on the program and updated
            EHS inspection forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast has developed and implemented a Violence Prevention in the
            Workplace Policy and Program. Westcoast employees receive Violence
            Prevention In the Workplace as well as EHS training when they are
            first hired and annually thereafter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast has implemented the Operational Steering Committee (OSC)
            Technical Risk Watch Report at the OSC and Area levels. The
            objectives of the OSC Technical Risk Watch Report are to identify
            and manage technical risk, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>personal safety;</li>
            <li>process safety;</li>
            <li>reliability; and</li>
            <li>regulatory risk.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal is zero loss incidents and to demonstrate mindful
            leadership principles of knowing, and managing risks to Westcoast
            operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Major Incidents Corrective Actions (MICA) Project has been
            initiated. The MICA project will review all formalized functions
            that are implemented and being followed at Westcoast. The MICA
            project’s objective is to standardize the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>job safety analysis (JSA);</li>
            <li>planning;</li>
            <li>safe work practices;</li>
            <li>PPE; and</li>
            <li>
              safe work permits. Subject matter experts from all Westcoast
              business units have been resourced to support the MICA project.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Westcoast’s Contractor EHS Management Standard provides guidance for
            the registration, selection and oversight of all contractors
            performing work for Westcoast. Westcoast contracts ISNetworld (ISN)
            to manage contractor pre-qualification. Westcoast has developed
            criteria for the pre-screening of contractors. The information
            requested from each contractor is used to evaluate general safety
            abilities. Safety information collected includes a contractor’s
            Total Injury Frequency Rate (TFR), company Health and Safety Manual,
            safety citations from a regulatory body, as well as Worker’s
            Compensation Board (WCB) rate sheets and WCB clearance letters.
            Safety manuals are reviewed by a third party, to help eliminate the
            perception of bias. ISN is not used to determine contractor training
            competency. Upon completion of the contract, the contractor's
            performance is reviewed and documented.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reviewing the components of Westcoast’s hazard identification
            assessment and control strategy for worker safety, Westcoast was not
            able to demonstrate that it has completed and documented a hazard
            identification, risk assessment and control procedure to address the
            risks created by seismic activity for its assets and infrastructure.

            programs as required.

            Westcoast has an EHS regulatory monitoring process for health and
            safety regulation changes. The EHS Regulatory Change Monitoring
            Process was implemented 29 September 2009. Westcoast contracts
            Templegate Information Services Inc. and Cyber Regs, subscription
            services for tracking legal initiatives and recent legal decisions
            (e.g., federal and provincial environmental initiatives, federal and
            provincial Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) initiatives,
            international initiatives, standards initiatives, other legal
            initiatives and recent legal decisions).
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Westcoast’s Confined Space Entry training reflects the
            provincial Work Safe BC legislation, Westcoast is federally
            regulated. The federal regulations require staff to be trained to
            CLC Part&nbsp;II confined space entry standards. The Westcoast
            EHS&nbsp;MS Manual requires the review and evaluation of contractor
            health and safety work and communication plans, developed in advance
            of work, to ensure they are appropriate to the risks of the work and
            ensure functional area integration for federal and provincial OHS
            requirements to ensure conflicts do not exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            A review of Westcoast safety training is required to ensure federal
            legislation is reflected in all safety training and identified

            The Operation Management System (OMS) includes: leadership and
            accountability programs, business planning, risk management,
            training and competency, incident management, management review and
            assurance programs. The OMS is linked to the Management of Change
            (MOC) process. The Scorecards are used to record voluntary
            regulatory instruments (Assurances of Voluntary Compliance or AVCs).
            However, it was noted that the Board Inspection Order (September
            2012) was not recorded in the Scorecards. The OMS system needs to be
            applied to all of the safety-related systems to confirm that Board
            Inspection Orders are included in the overall score to address noted
            non-compliances.

            The company should have goals, objectives and quantifiable targets
            relevant to the risks and hazards associated with the company’s
            facilities and activities (i.e., construction, operations and
            maintenance). The objectives and targets should be measurable and
            consistent with the Policy and legal requirements, and ideally
            include continual improvement and prevention initiatives, where
            appropriate.

            Goals are tangible objectives for meeting Westcoast EHS Policy and
            principles. The goals represent a shift from identifying EHS hazards
            to improving overall EHS performance by continually setting and
            reaching targets. Each member of Westcoast’s Leadership at a level
            of Director or above develops and implements an annual personal
            Safety Action Plan. Formal staff goals for Active EHS Leadership
            (Leadership Safety Action Plans), which include: People Oriented
            Culture (Employee Recordable Injury Frequency, Employee Vehicle
            Incident Reporting and Contractor Recordable Injury Frequency);
            Physical Environment (Non-Recordable Incident Reporting and
            Recordable Incident Corrective Actions); and Environmental Impacts
            (Reportable Spills), are set to a yearly and a multi-year plan
            within the Spectra Energy (Westcoast) EHS Blended Scorecard, an
            internal document used to determine individual goals and targets.
            Westcoast’s ‘Zero Incident Culture’ assigns incident reporting
            responsibility to all Westcoast employees and contractors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Employees discuss objectives with their supervisor at the beginning
            of the year, at least once during the year, and again at the end of
            the year when the past year’s performance is evaluated and
            objectives are established for the next year. Safety goals, targets
            and objectives have been identified for all staff and are included
            in individual job descriptions. Safety performance is included in
            the overall employee objectives and employees are provided
            recognition in meeting EHS performance objectives through a program
            known as Short Term Incentive Pay (STIP). The Accountability
            Management System and Performance Management goals and objectives
            are reviewed three times per year. STIP is linked to recorded
            injuries, vehicle incidents, contractor recordable incidents and
            environmental spills (considered a failure of process safety).
            Senior Management may not be eligible for Long Term Incentive Pay if
            targets are not met.
          </p>
          <p>
            The audit found that the NEB Assurances of Voluntary Compliance
            (AVCs) are currently being tracked on the Scorecard; however, no
            targets for continual improvement have been established. Board
            Inspection Officer Orders and Board Orders are not tracked on the
            Scorecard and therefore it is unclear whether senior management is
            being made aware of such enforcement measures. As an example, a
            Board Inspection Officer Order was issued to Westcoast in September
            2012; however, there is no record of this enforcement measure being
            discussed at any of the senior management level meetings (Weekly OSC
            or Bi-Monthly Audit Review Meetings).
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Board expects that goals, objectives and targets be developed
            based on risk and hazards, and not the amount of non-compliances
            they incur, the company is in compliance with this sub-element. See
            also sub-element 2.2 Legal Requirements.

            The Board verified that a management of change (MOC) procedure is in
            place which outlines the process for identifying, assessing and
            implementing procedural changes once they have been approved by the
            accountable individual (EHS&nbsp;MS Management of Change Performance
            Standard&nbsp;2.7). There is also a collaborative process in place
            to review all Standard Operating Procedures against all regulatory
            requirements and best practices for all of Westcoast. EHS is leading
            the process with the support of Senior Management and Regional
            subject matter experts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast demonstrated that it has a formal process and dedicated
            staff for managing changes to its assets. However, Westcoast’s MOC
            process, as demonstrated, is not considered compliant as it applies
            only to physical (asset) changes and not to changes required in
            practices or procedures that could result from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>changes to legal requirements;</li>
            <li>the identification of new hazards; or</li>
            <li>results of monitoring, inspections or investigations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Further, Westcoast’s MOC process only manages changes on a reactive
            basis (i.e., changes once the need has been identified). The Board
            expectation is that company MOC processes be proactive and formally
            linked to processes for the identification of changes that could
            affect the management and protection programs (e.g., Integrity
            Management, Safety, Environmental Protection, Emergency Management
            Programs, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast has initiated a MOC procedure review. December 2013 is the
            scheduled implementation of the revised MOC procedure. As the MOC
            review process is incomplete, the Board was unable to evaluate the
            results of the MOC review.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast was not able to demonstrate that a fully-implemented MOC
            program was in place to identify, document and analyze changes that
            could affect the EHS&nbsp;MS, including introduction of new risks,
            hazards or legal requirements.

            policies. Training should include emergency preparedness and
            environmental response requirements as well as the potential
            consequences of not following the requirements. The company should
            determine the required levels of competency for employees and

            Westcoast’s Training Program Charter provides guidance and support
            to meet regulatory and business training expectations. Training
            provides employees with the knowledge and skills to perform their
            role. Employee competency assessment in the application of skills is
            the responsibility of the employee’s leader or manager. The
            Accountability Management and Performance Management assessments
            determine employee competency and identify future training
            initiatives.

            Employee training records are stored in the LMS which generates
            monthly status reports for all leaders and groups, and annually
            assesses and communicates the status of the training programs and
            manuals. Employees are provided with any updates should additional
            training requirements be identified or should existing curriculums
            be changed. Westcoast also supports its safety personnel to further
            their education and training to acquire and maintain Safety

            Requirements) of this appendix that a review of Westcoast’s safety
            training is required to ensure federal legislation is reflected in
            the training and that identified conflicts are eliminated. As this
            Non-Compliance is already addressed in sub-element 2.2, the Board
            finds Westcoast’s Training Program to be Compliant, noting that

          </ul>
          <p>
            Legal and Human Resources may be consulted as necessary during the
            development or revision of an EHS standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            EHS Safety Specialists communicate draft standards to the OHSE
            Workplace Committees for review and comment in a timely manner. The
            EHS Standard Development Committee reviews all comments, updates the
            standards if necessary and provides feedback to individuals or
            committees who provided the input. The EHS Standard Development
            Committee develops an Implementation Impact Assessment for each
            proposed standard. Revised (updated) standards, including comments
            from OHSE Workplace Committees and the Implementation Impact
            Assessment, are sent to the EHS Director for review, comment, and
            communication to the Operations Management Team (OMT). Standards are
            endorsed by the OMT before review by the OHSE Oversight Committee.
            Proposed changes to EHS Standards are reviewed by the OHSE Oversight
            Committee to determine if consultation is required. New EHS
            Standards are approved by the EHS Director for implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast’s EHS Manuals do not reference OPR-99 requirements. Also,
            the audit found a number of performance standards and procedures
            that are either in draft status or out-of-date. For example, the
            Board requires that the Westcoast Construction On-site Manual be the
            same as the Westcoast Construction Manual that is filed with the
            Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board requires a review of all safety standards and procedures
            to ensure they are current and reflect revision dates and the
            requirements of OPR-99, CLC Part&nbsp;II and COHSR.

            tracked in the Incident Investigation Reporting (IIR) system).
            Westcoast indicated that the Environment Performance and Safety
            System (EPASS) tracking system are expected to be in place January
            2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            Document review confirmed that actions resulting from the
            above-listed activities are assigned and tracked to ensure all
            issues are addressed and reported. Westcoast tracks the actions
            until completion and verifies their effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast has developed and implemented a comprehensive incident
            investigation process. The incident reporting and investigation
            process includes near misses, and includes contractors in incident
            investigations when appropriate. The investigation process
            identifies root causes. Incidents are analyzed to detect patterns or
            trends to anticipate and prevent future incidents. The incidents and
            accidents are recorded and reported as per policy. Best practices
            and lessons learned are shared with internal stakeholders and
            contractors who can benefit.

            Westcoast’s Regulatory Incident Reporting Guidelines for On-Call
            Supervisors is approved and communicated to control teams and
            on-call incident supervisors. The purpose of the guidelines is to
            assist Westcoast’s On-Call Supervisors and On-Call Incident
            Supervisors in the external reporting of “regulatory reportable”
            incidents that occur in both its federally and provincially
            regulated facilities. This regulatory reporting practice was put in
            place to ensure timely notification of reportable occurrences to the
            appropriate regulatory agency regardless of where the incident
            occurs across the facilities. The Regulatory Incident Reporting
            Guidelines For On-Call Supervisors is controlled by the incident
            management program and is reviewed on an annual basis by all
            stakeholders to ensure it is current. The One-Window Reporting
            Procedures, embedded in the EHS Checklist, are reviewed on initial
            hiring and annually thereafter. Evidence of the checklist review was
            found in the LMS.

            The audit found that the NEB Assurances of Voluntary Compliance
            (AVCs) are currently being tracked on the Scorecard; however, no
            targets for continual improvement have been established. Board
            Inspection Officer Orders and Board Orders are not tracked on the
            Scorecard and therefore it is unclear whether senior management is
            being made aware of such enforcement measures. As an example, a
            Board Inspection Officer Order was issued to Westcoast in September
            2012; however, there is no record of this enforcement measure being
            discussed at any of the senior management level meetings (Weekly OSC
            or Bi-Monthly Audit Review Meetings). There is inconsistency in the
            communication, tracking and resolution of non-compliances outlined
            in Board Inspection Orders.

            appropriate types of records to be retained, retention and
            disposition timeframes and disposal methods. Copies of all records

            While all records requested were readily retrieved, it was indicated
            during interviews that the company lacked a formalized process for
            email correspondence retention. The company has established that all
            unfiled emails will be deleted after three months and those that
            have been moved to a folder are deleted after two years. Individual
            staff have established their personal method in ensuring that these
            records are maintained; however, the Board is concerned that,
            without a formal filing process, certain email correspondence which
            contain compliance information may be deleted and not easily
            accessible in the event of an investigation.

            Westcoast has an internal audit program to assess its EHS&nbsp;MS
            against its regulatory requirements. However, the audit found that
            the absence of an effective process to identify and integrate all of
            the legal operational safety requirements could lead to incomplete
            EHS audit protocols and inaccurate internal audit findings. The
            specific discipline audits conducted are performance audits, not
            compliance or technical audits. The Board was unable to confirm that
            Westcoast has conducted an internal audit that included all
            management systems in the audit scope (i.e., Integrity, Safety,
            Environment, Emergency Management, Public Awareness and Crossings).

          <h4>Expectations:</h4>
          <p>
            Senior management should formally review the management and
            protection programs for continuing suitability, adequacy and
            effectiveness. The review should be based on appropriate
            documentation and records including the results of the surveillance,
            monitoring and audit programs. This review should be formal and
            documented and should occur on a regular basis. The management
            review should include a review of any decisions, actions and
            commitments which relate to the improvement of the programs and the
            company’s overall performance.

          <h4>Assessment:</h4>
          <p>
            Westcoast’s EHS&nbsp;MS Performance Standard&nbsp;9.4, Management
            System Review establishes minimum expectations for conducting a
            Management System Review with senior management to determine whether
            changes to the EHS Policy, EHS goals and targets or other elements
            of the EHS&nbsp;MS are necessary to ensure effectiveness of the
            EHS&nbsp;MS based on EHS audit results, EHS performance, changing
            business needs and/or stakeholder inputs. The Management System
            Review is conducted at least annually, preferably in the third
            quarter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management System Reviews may be conducted more frequently when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>important new EHS regulatory or EHS issues arise;</li>
            <li>significant hazards/risks are identified; or</li>
            <li>
              previous audits/assessments have identified on-going deficiencies
              in the EHS&nbsp;MS.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although the audit found that there is a level of oversight
            provided, given the absence of rigor in the reporting and tracking
            of non-compliances, as well as the deficient audit process described
            in sub-element 4.4 of this appendix, the Board has determined that
            the level of management oversight does not meet its expectations.

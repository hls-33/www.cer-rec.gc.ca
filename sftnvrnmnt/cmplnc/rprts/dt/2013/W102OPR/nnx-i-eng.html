          <h5>Set-BC PIP</h5>
          <p>
            With respect to sub-element&nbsp;1.1 Policy and Commitment, the
            SET-BC PIP contains the management statement in Section&nbsp;1 of
            the document as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Pipeline Integrity Program (PIP) is a process for setting
            policy and expectations for all Pipeline and Field Services
            personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of our
            pipelines. Highly reliable pipelines and quality pipeline integrity
            practices are critical to the success of Pipeline and Field Services
            business. Everyone who is engaged in the operation, maintenance and
            reliability of our assets has a personal responsibility for getting
            pipeline integrity right. Line managers should follow this document
            in order to comply with Pipeline and Field Services pipeline
            integrity policies.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy and commitment statement is signed by the Vice
            President, Operations, General Manager, Field Services, and General
            Manager, Pipeline, Midstream and NGL.
          </p>
          <h5>Set-BC PEIM</h5>
          <p>
            The SET-BC PEIM, Section&nbsp;1 contains a management statement
            setting the policy and expectations for all personnel involved in
            the pressure equipment in above ground facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This management statement, signed by the Vice President SET-West
            Operations,  states:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Management shall follow this document in order to comply with
            Pipeline and Field Services (PLFS) Pressure Equipment Integrity
            Policy and the applicable regulatory requirements.”
          </p>
          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>
            Policy and commitment statements exist for the Westcoast pipeline
            system. However, as general observation, the two statements as
            written may appear to lack a strong management direction with
            current wording (i.e. the use of “should” versus “shall”).
          </p>
          <p>
            During interviews with Westcoast staff, they indicated that the
            Operations Management System (OMS) outlines the management
            commitment and the roles of Operations personnel. The OMS
            information is located on the Westcoast’s intranet site, the Source;
            however the policy and commitment document is not located on the
            Source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both management and employees contributed to the development of the
            OMS. The IMP policy and commitment fits into the hierarchy of the
            SET policy and commitments. The OMS is informally reviewed by
            management with employees but there is no formal communication plan
            for the various policy and commitment statements. The management
            system element of communication is reviewed and assessed under 3.4
            Communication in this audit evaluation table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast meets the requirements for policy and commitment in its
            IMP. Based on documents reviewed and interviews, Westcoast was able
            to demonstrate that it has policy approved and endorsed by senior
            management and the policy commits to continual improvement and is
            communicated throughout the organization and it has met the
            requirements of this audit sub-element.

            associated with these hazards. The company should be able to support
            the rationale for including or excluding possible risks in regard to
            its environment, safety, integrity, crossings and awareness and
            emergency management and protection programs (management and
            protection programs). The company shall be able to implement control
            measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.

          <h5>Set-BC PIP</h5>
          <p>
            With respect to this sub-element, Section&nbsp;3.0 Scope of the
            SET-BC PIP states that “This Program addresses the routine integrity
            activities for both operating and deactivated pipelines in the BC
            Pipeline and Field Services Division of SET-BC. The PIP considers
            all hazards that may cause significant damage or deterioration to
            the pipelines. This document is applicable to the entire SET-BC
            pipeline system with the exception of pressure vessels, associated
            pressure piping, compressors and associated equipment, and pipeline
            valves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Section&nbsp;10.0 Pipeline Risk Assessment of the SET-BC PIP
            contains a general statement: “Risk assessment principles, in
            various forms, have been the foundation of integrity management.
            Risk assessments can vary in scope or complexity and use different
            methods or techniques. For SET-BC a key role of performing a formal
            risk assessment of the pipeline system is to validate the
            effectiveness of the Pipeline Integrity Program and identify any
            deficiencies or needed changes in the integrity program.
          </p>
          <p>
            SET-BC risk assessment considers several variables and attributes
            with regards to eight threats and three consequences. These threats
            are; external corrosion, internal corrosion, manufacturing defects,
            ground movement, third party damage, incorrect operations,
            construction threat and stress corrosion cracking. The consequence
            types are; safety, economic loss, and environmental loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            SET- BC has selected the Dynamic Risk – Risk Analyst Program as the
            primary risk assessment software. This is a comprehensive tool that
            performs pipeline risk assessment calculations and analysis. This
            ability allows SET- BC to identify the primary risk drivers and plan
            mitigation accordingly.”
          </p>
          <h5>Set-BC PEIM</h5>
          <p>
            The SET-BC PEIM does not speak directly to risk assessment, but does
            reference the Risked-Based Inspection approach used for pressure
            vessels and pressure piping. Section&nbsp;14.2 Inspection Management
            Guidelines, states the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            “The PLFS Inspection Management Guidelines drive the inspection and
            RBI process. Inspection management software is used to manage
            technical data and records for pressure equipment. Inspection
            requirements and frequencies are established and maintained through
            the risk based module within this program.”
          </p>
          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>
            The statements quoted in the SET-BC PIP indicate that Westcoast
            identifies many of the hazards to its pipeline by way of its current
            monitoring and inspection programs. Westcoast provided an example of
            a documented hazard identification supporting the rationale for
            including or excluding industry recognized hazards and a documented
            risk assessment assessing the degree of risk associated with these
            hazards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Documentation reviewed as an example of the hazard identification
            and risk assessment for CS7 to CS8 on the 30” pipeline confirmed
            that a comprehensive integrity relative risk analysis was performed
            and had evaluated seven standard threats. The consequences of a
            pipeline failure as a result of these threats were also evaluated in
            the areas of impact on population, environment and business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on documents reviewed and interviews, the Company was able to
            demonstrate that it has a documented procedure to identify all
            possible hazards. Westcoast was able to demonstrate that it has
            assessed the degree of risk associated with these hazards.

            The SET-BC PIP document, Section&nbsp;2 states that Westcoast is
            committed to operating and maintaining its pipeline system in a
            responsible manner that complies with the requirements of
            CSA&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Z662 and the National Energy Board Onshore
            Pipeline Regulations. Other than the statement in Section&nbsp;2,
            there is no documented procedure for reviewing and updating
            revisions to legal requirements. However, Westcoast personnel have
            representations on regulatory committees (e.g., Canadian Standards
            Association (CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 and CSA&nbsp;B51-09) technical
            committees and the International Pressure Equipment Association
            (IPEA), so that they are informed on current and upcoming

            As with the API standards, the NACE, CGA and CAPP industry standards
            and best practices are not strictly legal requirements. However SET
            should include reference to them in its PEIM, in its PIP, and
            possibly in its Standard Operating Practices (SOP), where
            appropriate, because they contain valuable information that is
            technically relevant to its inspection, monitoring and mitigation
            programs. During interviews with some of the operations personnel,
            it was evident that they were not aware of many of these
            publications and that they could have benefited from the knowledge
            of these in the implementation of the Westcoast IMP programs
            referenced in the publications.

          <p>
            With respect to goals, objectives and continuous improvement,
            Westcoast has established five key performance indicators (KPI)
            relevant to its IMP. Section&nbsp;11: Program Performance Indicators
            of the PIP states: “In order to regularly assess the success of
            program implementation SET-BC has developed a slate of Program
            Performance Indicators which will be assessed annually:
          </p>

            <li>
              Number of geotechnical incidents that require repair or stress
              mitigation.”

          </ul>
          <h5>Set-BC PEIM</h5>

          </p>
          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>
            The Westcoast systems integrity group indicated during interviews
            that the integrity performance indicators outlined in the PIP were
            recently collected and presented to SET management. The performance
            indicators were also reviewed with the Pipeline Operations and
            Maintenance Manual (POMM) team. The POMM team was asked to consider
            what performance indicators would be useful from a regional
            perspective and to forward any suggestions or ideas to the System
            Integrity group.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the annual Information Exchange meeting with SET, the Systems
            Integrity group presented the KPI trends, which they provided as
            evidence of satisfactory implementation of the Integrity Program in
            achieving the program objectives. Westcoast also provided KPI
            scoring and tracking (SET OSC Monthly Scorecard - 2011 and 2012.pdf
            and SET-West OSC STIP Scorecard - December 2011.pdf), but these were
            related to OH&amp;S key performance indicators and will be assessed
            by the Safety Discipline in this audit.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the Draft Audit Report, Westcoast provided the OSC
            STIP Scorecard for December 2012 which included one performance
            metric related to its IMP, Cathodic Protection (CP) Effectiveness
            (Transmission). This performance metric indicated that 78 of
            78&nbsp;CP surveys were completed but that five areas were
            identified (November 2012) as not meeting the accepted CP criteria.
            It further indicated that, of the five remediation projects
            developed, none of them had been completed at the time of the
            December Scorecard issuance. This lack of immediate response is to
            be expected given the timeframe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the SET-West STIP Scorecard contains one performance metric
            for its IMP, it does not contain any KPIs for its Pressure Equipment
            Integrity Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the audit, Westcoast presented the KPI’s for corrosion
            coupons which indicated that 100% of the coupons met the target of
            less than 1 MPY, but examination of historical corrosion coupon
            results indicated that not all coupons met this key performance
            indicator target. Therefore, Westcoast has not accurately tracked or
            reported one of its KPIs for its IMP.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the Draft Audit Report, Westcoast explained that the
            discrepancy in the historical corrosion coupon results versus the
            reported KPIs was due to Westcoast having provided the Board’s
            auditors with unfiltered data (i.e., corrosion coupon data from both
            the flowing pipeline, and from launching and receiving barrels).
            Westcoast clarified in its comments that the KPI target is based
            entirely on flowing pipeline coupon data and that, until recently,
            pipeline corrosion coupon data was the only data available.
            Westcoast indicated that, within the last couple of years, it has
            begun to install coupons in the launching and receiving barrels, and
            has determined that the same KPI target is not achievable in the
            relatively stagnant barrel environment. To ensure it is able to
            measure corrosion rates on its sending and receiving barrels,
            Westcoast indicated that, over the next few years, it will be
            installing coupon holders on most of the barrels in the gathering
            systems. Westcoast further indicated that, based on its limited data
            set, it appears that a barrel coupon KPI of more than 2 MPY may be
            reasonable; however, until it has more experience with this
            application, it is not able to state a specific barrel corrosion
            coupon KPI. Westcoast committed to clarifying that the KPI
            referenced in its IMP refers only to corrosion coupons in the
            flowing pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Westcoast’s comments on the Draft Audit Report provided some
            clarification on the coupon information; however, as Westcoast is
            still in the process of determining an appropriate target for its
            KPI with respect to barrel coupons, the adequacy and effectiveness
            of this target with respect to Westcoast’s IMP could not be
            assessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In March 2012, the Board posted its

              >Pipeline Performance Measures Reporting Requirements</a
            >
            stating that operating companies are required to annually report on
            the new performance measures commencing in 2013. The requirement to
            report on the new performance measures is in addition to current
            reporting required under the Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999 and
            the Pipeline Crossing Regulations, Part&nbsp;I and Part&nbsp;II.
            Part IV of the posted document specifies the reporting requirements
            for Integrity Management. In the posted information, it was stated
            that the Board expects companies, in their management systems, to
            set out objectives and targets that are company-specific and based
            on company variables. In addition, companies are expected to strive
            for continual improvement and to adjust targets as required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the SET-BC PEIM does not have a documented Goals, Objectives
            and Targets for the Integrity Management Program for its pressure
            equipment and the SET-BC PIP has not accurately tracked or reported
            its Key Performance Indicators, Westcoast has not met the
            requirements for the audit sub-element of Goals, Objectives and
            Targets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on documents reviewed and interviews with operations staff,
            the Company was not able to demonstrate that it was in compliance
            with audit sub-element 2.3 Goals, Objectives and Targets.

            Receipt Points that aid in protecting the pipelines from over
            pressure according to CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Section&nbsp;4.18. These
            include system requirements for Pressure Control systems and for
            Over pressure Protection systems.

            With respect to the requirements of Operations Control-Normal
            Operations, Section&nbsp;16 of the SET-BC PEIM, Overpressure
            Protection and Protective Devices stated “This section reviews the
            approach for ensuring that all pressure relief devices (PRDs) are
            serviced at the required intervals, proper procedures are followed
            in removing the devices and each device is returned to the original
            or other appropriate location.”

          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>
            Westcoast provided documents and records indicating that PRDs
            serving the pipeline and facilities were regularly serviced and
            inspected on an interval of 3&nbsp;years. The service records are
            being stored in VisionsTM software, which is used to manage the
            servicing, inspection and surplus inventory records.

            </li>
            <li>
              The audit found that the incident management data analysis,
              trending and reporting process is relatively new (developed in
              2009) and is not yet mature (primary focus is on API RP 754 safety

            (gathering and transmission pipelines), facilities and equipment and
            management system disciplines. Spectra Energy should have analyzed
            these data to identify trends, systemic issues and opportunities for

          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>
            Following review of the SET-BC PIP and SET-BC PEIM, the Board made
            an AIR for the latest internal or third party audits that would
            pertain to the Integrity Management Program and the management
            system requirements.
          </p>
          <p>Westcoast’s response to the AIR was as follows:</p>
          <p>
            “It has been more than 5&nbsp;years since the last internal Pipeline
            Integrity Program review. This was done by the Duke internal audit
            team. At that time only a few minor modifications to the cathodic
            protection requirements were recommended.
          </p>
          <p>
            An integrity effectiveness review was recently carried out on all
            Spectra pipeline integrity programs by a consulting team engaged by
            the Houston corporate auditing group. This report is still being
            finalized. We were recently advised that Spectra West will
            experience an internal audit of pipeline integrity during 2012.”
          </p>
          <p>During audit interviews, the audit found that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There has not been an internal audit of Westcoast’s systems since
              2005.
            </li>
            <li>
              Westcoast has completed Assurance Reviews which do not examine
              evidence or documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Documents presented by Westcoast at the meeting did not
              demonstrate:
              <ul>
                <li>The methodology to determine appropriate frequency</li>
                <li>
                  Whether subject matter experts (SMEs) are involved in internal
                  audits
                </li>
                <li>That the audit results are incorporated into IMP.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In its comments on the Board’s Draft Audit Report, Westcoast advised
            that it has commenced an internal audit of Pipeline Integrity. This
            internal audit is still in progress and did not form part of the
            Board’s assessment of this sub-element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on documents reviewed and interviews with operations staff,
            the Company was not able to demonstrate that it was in compliance
            with the requirements of the audit element Internal Audit.

          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>
            As a result of audit interviews and document review, the audit found
            that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There is no specific section in the SET-BC PIP on Management
              Review other than the general statements previously described for
              Sections&nbsp;2 and 6.1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Management review processes and procedures (e.g., Scorecard, Key
              Performance Metrics and Short-Term Incentive Pay) that were
              provided during the audit were not linked to the performance of
              the Westcoast IMP.
            </li>
            <li>
              In response to the Draft Audit Report, Westcoast provided the
              SET-West Occupational Steering Committee Short Term Incentive Pay
              (STIP) Scorecard for December 2012 (Scorecard) and commented that
              the Scorecard included Key Performance Metrics for Integrity and
              Measurement Compliance. The single performance metric described in
              the Scorecard was Cathodic Protection Effectiveness
              (Transmission). While this Scorecard describes one performance
              metric that is reviewed by management to monitor IMP performance,
              it was not adequate to demonstrate the required link between
              current management review processes and IMP performance, or that
              Westcoast is conducting regular management review of its IMP to
              assess its continued suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are ad hoc, non-formalized management reviews occurring;
              however, there are no documented processes for these (e.g. annual
              review of the PIP and SOP’s, monthly IMP meetings, annual IMP
              workshops).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Based on documents reviewed and interviews with operations staff,
            the Company was not able to demonstrate that it was in compliance
            with the requirements of the audit element Management Review.

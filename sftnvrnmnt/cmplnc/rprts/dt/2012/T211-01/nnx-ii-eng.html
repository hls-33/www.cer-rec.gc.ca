              <h2 id="ntr">Introduction:</h2>
              <p>
                TransCanada has three Integrity Management Programs (IMPs),
                which are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Canadian Gas Pipeline Integrity Management Program
                  (CND-GAS-IMP);
                </li>
                <li>
                  Canadian Liquid Integrity Management Program (CDN-LIQ-IMP);
                  and
                </li>
                <li>Plant Integrity Management Program (Plant IMP).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These IMPs are referred to throughout this Audit Evaluation
                Table as the Gas Pipeline IMP, Liquid Pipeline IMP, and Plant
                IMP, respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                The TransCanada subsidiaries included in this audit included
                specifically:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>TransCanada PipeLines Limited;</li>
                <li>TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP Ltd.;</li>
                <li>Trans Québec &amp; Maritimes Pipeline Inc.;</li>
                <li>Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd.; and</li>
                <li>NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="bjct">Audit Objectives and Scope:</h2>
              <p>
                The scope of the audit included an assessment of whether
                TransCanada was fulfilling the requirements of:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>the NEB Act;</li>
                <li>the OPR-99;</li>
                <li>
                  <em>CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em>; and
                </li>
                <li>TransCanada’s policies, practices and procedures.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                More specifically, the audit examined nine sub-elements of the
                NEB management system requirements as they relate to
                TransCanada’s integrity management programs. These sub-elements
                were selected using the Board’s risk-informed approach to focus
                the scope of the audit on areas that have previously been shown
                to have the highest rates of non-compliance among NEB-regulated
                companies and to expedite and focus the assessment of the IMP
                technical programs in light of the allegations.

                During interviews and in documents submitted, TransCanada stated
                that it has developed procedures to identify threats (hazards),
                assess the degree of risk associated with those threats, and
                implement control measures to mitigate or eliminate the risk of
                the threats. TransCanada explained that its Engineering and
                Asset Reliability (E&amp;AR) department is accountable for
                managing the operational performance, cost and risks of
                TransCanada’s pipeline and facility assets. This includes
                developing and implementing asset strategies and integrity
                management systems to manage operating and maintenance risk.
                Within the E&amp;AR department, subject matter experts in the
                Pipe Integrity and Facilities Integrity departments are
                responsible for developing Integrity Management Programs (IMPs).
                Pipe Integrity is grouped into threat-specific teams, and
                Facilities Integrity is grouped into equipment-specific teams.
                These teams are accountable for assessing risks and developing
                annual maintenance and assessment work plans.

              <p>
                TransCanada’s threat identification process is meant to verify
                conditions that may exist that would make a line segment
                susceptible to a threat. The determination of these conditions
                varies with each threat category. TransCanada considers threats
                according to the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Time Dependent

                TransCanada’s process for threat identification was reviewed for
                all threats and, except where noted for the threat to high
                pressure station piping in gas facilities, was assessed to be
                compliant with the requirements. An example of one of the threat
                assessments for mechanical damage (dents) is provided to
                illustrate TransCanada’s process.

              </h6>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s dent program is managed according to
                TEP-ILI-DEF-CDN Analysis of Deformation In-Line Inspection (ILI)
                Data for CDN Pipelines (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006980190) and
                TEP-ITM-Mechanical Damage Threat Management Program
                (TEP-ITM-MECH, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006786487). TransCanada uses
                data from the ILI program to characterize dents in its pipeline
                system and TransCanada continues to develop this technology with
                the tool vendors. The detection and characterization of
                geometric anomalies undergoes further processing to develop
                prioritized remediation activities in specific areas, based on
                previous excavation reports from other programs and in areas
                where dents have been previously mitigated. When dents are
                excavated, TransCanada applies the methodologies of
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, ASME&nbsp;B31.8 and its own modified B31.8
                formula to determine which remediation or mitigation techniques
                may be applied. TransCanada considers the threat of mechanical
                damage from external sources as low, due to its Public Awareness
                Program and the Right of Way (ROW) patrols that it conducts.
                Additional measures are applied to areas determined to have a
                threat of mechanical damage that is higher than low (e.g.,
                population density, history of damage, increased construction
                activity).

                Section&nbsp;9 of the Gas Pipeline IMP specifies how each threat
                management program has a consistent approach whereby threat
                identification is one step in an overall threat management
                process. Pipe segments susceptible to a threat are identified
                and the rationale for including or excluding threats is
                documented within each threat management program. Risk analyses
                are completed and the results of the analyses are used to
                prioritize and plan activities to reduce or eliminate the
                probability of failure, the consequences of failure, or both.
                Selected activities for the upcoming budget cycle are captured
                annually in TransCanada’s Pipeline Maintenance Plan. Results
                obtained from the execution of the Pipeline Maintenance Plan are
                assessed and used as additional inputs into the next planning
                cycle.

                The TransCanada Facility Group is divided into several areas of
                expertise, which include Mechanical, Field SCADA, Civil
                Engineering, Design Engineering Support, Measurement
                Engineering, Controls, and Electrical. As per Section&nbsp;2.5.5
                of the Plant IMP, new construction is completed in compliance
                with the applicable codes, which address the associated hazards
                and corresponding risks. In addition, many of the potential
                operating hazards are identified and mitigated during the early
                design stage through Hazard Identification Studies (HAZID) and
                Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP) analyses. With the
                Project Turnover Memorandum, residual risks are identified and
                documented for the facility integrity group. To address ongoing
                reliability, applicable existing plans are used, or new
                integrity plans are created, to maintain the equipment
                functionality so that the identified hazards, associated designs
                and codes are managed throughout the lifecycle of the equipment.

              <p>
                TransCanada developed a new management program in
                December&nbsp;2012 for high pressure piping in gas facilities
                (e.g., meter and compressor stations, valves sites). This is
                documented in the Facility Pipe Threat Management Program
                (TEP-ITM-FPIPE-CDN, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;007379193). Before this
                new program was developed, the station piping was managed under
                TransCanada’s

                TransCanada has implemented its Asset Management System (AMS) to
                manage its operating and maintenance risk. The risk management
                element of the AMS outlines a requirement for Operations and
                Engineering to develop and maintain a risk register to capture
                risk events for all assets that TransCanada operates. The Asset
                Management System &amp; Governance (AMS&amp;G) team oversees the
                development of the register, but inputs are collected from
                engineering, field operations, commercial operations, corporate
                health and safety, and compliance departments. Risks are
                calculated by aligning the probability of events and the
                potential magnitude of consequences. The risk register is
                currently entered and maintained within a Microsoft Access
                database and is controlled by the AMS&amp;G team during its
                developmental stages to maintain integrity of the data. An
                assessment of the establishment and implementation of the risk
                assessment processes follows, based on facility categorizations.

                the Liquid Pipeline IMP. As noted previously under Threat

              <p>
                TransCanada’s risk assessment and risk management are achieved
                using either of the following two approaches:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  For pipelines where assessment or direct examination anomalies
                  have been detected, or similar conditions are inferred, the
                  specific anomalies are assessed, and control or mitigation
                  activities are planned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For pipelines where assessment data has not been collected,
                  risk assessment is performed by integrating information from
                  various sources, including: subject matter expertise; applied
                  learnings from other similar segments of pipe across the
                  TransCanada system, including historical performance; the
                  TransCanada risk algorithm Risk Assessment Using PRIME
                  (TEP-INT-PRIME, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003972569), for External
                  Corrosion and SCC threat; and, the tracking of leading
                  indicators, such as an elevation in communication to
                  stakeholders in response to a spike in the frequency of
                  unauthorized encroachments on the ROW or relevant information
                  from industry associations.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Where assessment data is available, a pre-screening is performed
                to look for urgent repair conditions. This is followed by a
                reliability based assessment to evaluate the probability of
                failure and account for measurement uncertainties. The technical
                details of the model are included in the document Risk Models
                for Corrosion Using ILI Data (TER-COR-RSK,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;005767603). With the assessment data,
                near-term and future remediation is planned, and priority is
                assigned according to population density.   Additionally,
                ongoing safety is addressed through a temporary pressure
                restriction. The criteria for determining when a pressure
                restriction is required are outlined in Analysis of MFL In-Line
                Inspection for CDN Pipelines (CDN) (TEP-INT-ILI-CDN
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006570876). The procedure for implementing
                the pressure restriction is outlined in the TOP Pipeline
                Restriction Procedure. Pressure control is addressed per the
                System Design &amp; Commercial Operations Pipeline MAOP De-rate
                Procedure (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006837355).

                is performed by executing the TransCanada risk algorithm Risk
                Assessment Using PRIME (TEP-INT-PRIME,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003972569). Subject matter experts integrate
                the PRIME data results with other relevant information to
                prioritize the pipeline inspection schedules.

                An example of risk assessment and management is provided for the
                Weather and Outside Forces (WOF) threat. This threat is managed
                according to the Weather and Outside Forces Threat Management
                Program (TEP-ITM-WOF, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;005767611). The
                approach is to conduct a Phase&nbsp;1 geotechnical study along
                all of the company pipeline assets. Areas of elevated concern
                are identified and then reviewed further with Phase&nbsp;2 and
                Phase&nbsp;3 studies. The collected information is used to
                determine the actual risk to the pipeline asset, and then
                mitigation, control or monitoring programs are planned, based on
                the results. TransCanada’s risk assessment and risk management
                process for the threat of WOF was assessed to be adequate.

              <p>
                In managing the integrity of non-pipe facilities, TransCanada
                identified a number of potential integrity threats, including
                equipment failure, inability to operate as expected,
                obsolescence, and environmental and safety concerns.
                Consequences of facility threats and potential failures include
                public safety impact, loss of life, customer/business impact,
                regulatory impact, and environmental impact. Risk assessments
                are performed on the potential threats and consequences to
                identify potential impacts as well as corrective and preventive
                actions. When activities are required to manage the risk, the
                details on conducting these activities are then documented in
                TransCanada’s equipment-specific integrity plans. Each
                equipment-specific integrity plan is developed with input from
                the regions, equipment manufacturers, Issue and Incident
                Tracking (IIT), other operators, Pipeline System Operations, and
                the previous year’s integrity plans. The equipment-specific
                integrity plans reference the relevant TransCanada Operating
                Procedures (TOPs) that were developed to manage threats and
                mitigate risks to the reliable operation of facility equipment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specific equipment integrity plans that address the risk
                requirements have been written for many equipment types.

                Threat identification and risk assessment activities are
                aggregated annually as part of the pipeline and facilities
                maintenance program budget approval process. The Pipeline and
                Facilities Maintenance Programs (PMP) for&nbsp;2013, which are
                the output of the aggregated threat identification risk
                assessment, were finalized in September&nbsp;2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                Records indicated that for pipelines and facilities, work is
                planned and risk assessments are conducted with consideration
                given to the consequences of safety, health, the environment and
                individual risk. Consequences are considered during
                prioritization of remediation, prevention, control and
                mitigation activities, and also in repair criteria.
              </p>
              <p>
                For gas pipelines, mitigation and repair activities requiring
                excavation of pipeline assets are conducted under the TOP
                Excavation Procedure (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003672343). The
                procedure references consultation with a TransCanada
                Environmental Specialist, and requires all work to be performed
                in compliance with the Environmental Field Procedures Guide
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003671954).
              </p>
              <p>
                For liquid pipelines, risk assessments take into consideration
                the consequences of a potential release. For example, potential
                consequences that are considered are oil releases into what
                TransCanada refers to as &quot;highly sensitive receptors&quot;.
                These are defined by TransCanada as specific areas where a
                release from a pipeline could have significant consequences on
                public health, the environment or the economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the risk associated with third party damage, TransCanada has
                pipeline class location and urban development programs to
                evaluate the issue relating to protecting the public and the
                pipeline as population growth encroaches on pipelines (Pipeline

                Upon completion of a threat identification and risk assessment,
                the individual threat teams develop a threat-specific Pipeline
                Maintenance Plan (PMP). Asset-based program planners assemble
                the threat specific sections of the PMP into a single, asset
                specific, PMP. During audit interviews and through documents
                reviewed, the Board confirmed that threat identification for the
                liquid pipeline has been performed primarily by the liquid
                integrity team, with adequate support from the threat-specific
                subject matter experts as required.

                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;2.1, Hazard
                Identification, Risk Assessment and Control, requires a company
                to have a procedure to identify all possible hazards, to assess
                the degree of risk associated with these hazards, and to
                implement control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has implemented a system to identify and manage its
                operating and maintenance risk. Risks are calculated by
                incorporating the probability of events and the potential
                magnitude of the consequences. Records indicate that for
                pipelines and facilities, work is planned and risk-assessments
                are conducted with consideration given to safety, health, and
                the environment. TransCanada’s process for threat identification
                was reviewed for all threats and was assessed to be compliant
                with the requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified only one area of non-compliance in the
                sub-element of hazard identification, risk assessment and gas
                control. TransCanada developed a new management program for high
                pressure piping in facilities. This new program has been
                assessed and is adequate in terms of its content, but has not
                yet been fully implemented throughout all of TransCanada’s
                facilities.

                addition, approximately 80&nbsp;integrity specialists are
                located in regional offices across the Canadian pipeline system.
                These individuals are complemented by Field Technicians who
                execute integrity related activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hierarchy of authority for the IMPs within TransCanada
                extends from an Executive Vice President, to Vice President, to
                Director, to Manager, to Program Lead/Manager levels. Under the
                Vice President of Engineering and Asset Reliability, one
                Director is responsible for pipe integrity and another Director
                is responsible for facilities (plant) integrity. The authorities
                and associated responsibilities are detailed in the respective
                IMP documents, specifically:
              </p>

                <li>Gas Pipeline IMP, Section&nbsp;3 and Appendix&nbsp;A;</li>
                <li>
                  Liquid Pipeline IMP, Section&nbsp;2 and Appendix&nbsp;A; and

              </ul>
              <p>
                The audit determined that, for the Gas and Liquid Pipeline IMPs,
                roles and responsibilities are defined and documented for the
                key positions. These two IMPs also describe the accountabilities
                and responsibilities of the relevant TransCanada organizational
                units, arranged by Threats. The roles and responsibilities for
                each organizational unit are further detailed in the TransCanada
                Engineering Procedures (TEPs) for each Threat, as follows:

              <p>
                Based on documentation reviewed and interviews with personnel,
                TransCanada’s organizational structure, roles and
                responsibilities for the Gas and Liquid Pipeline IMPs are
                compliant with the requirements for this sub-element. The
                organizational structures relevant to these two IMPs are well
                defined, with adequate dedicated resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit determined that the roles and responsibilities for the
                Plant IMP are not as well defined. In Section&nbsp;2.2 of the
                Plant IMP (Lines of Responsibility and Development of IMP/Risk
                Mitigation Process), only high level positions (e.g., Executive
                Vice President, Vice President, Director) are identified with
                respect to the Plant IMP. The functional key positions for the
                Plant IMP are not specified. The organizational chart in
                Appendix&nbsp;C of the Plant IMP is considerably less detailed
                than the organizational charts provided in Appendix&nbsp;A of
                both the Gas Pipeline IMP and the Liquid Pipeline IMP.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada was in the process of revising its
                Plant IMP. The Facility Integrity and Reliability Management
                Program (FIRM) (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;007803540) were approved by
                TransCanada management in July&nbsp;2013. Section&nbsp;2.2
                (Roles and Responsibilities) of the FIRM more explicitly details
                the functions and processes of the FIRM Program, departmental
                interactions and the organizational structure. The roles and
                responsibilities for pressure vessels, over-pressure protection,
                relief valves and tanks were referenced in the appropriate TEPs,
                TransCanada Engineering Specifications (TESs), TransCanada
                Operating Procedures (TOPs) and TransCanada Engineering
                Directives (TEDs). The FIRM references Section&nbsp;6 of
                TransCanada’s Quality Assurance Manual (QMS)
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003722000) that identifies the roles and
                responsibilities for pressure vessels, heating boilers and ASME
                pressure relief vessels across the organization. TransCanada’s
                revised FIRM addresses the requirements of roles and
                responsibilities that were lacking in the Plant IMP.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the organizational structure related to
                TransCanada’s IMPs, the audit assessed the roles and
                responsibilities of integrity personnel as they relate to
                construction projects. This information was required because the
                IMPs are under the main organizational structure of Operations
                and Engineering (O&amp;E), while construction activities are
                under the main organizational structure of Major Projects. In
                light of this separate organizational structure, the audit
                assessed whether sharing of information on integrity related
                issues, incidents and learnings identified is occurring. Sharing
                of information related to issues identified during the
                operational life of pipelines and facilities (by the IMP
                personnel) is important because it could require changes to the
                design and/or construction of future pipelines and facilities
                (by the Major Projects personnel). Conversely, sharing of
                information related to issues identified during construction is
                important because it could have an impact on the subsequent IMPs
                for both pipelines and facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                During audit interviews, TransCanada explained how its Capital
                Projects Management System requires that functional engagement
                and support between O&amp;E and Major Projects occur, and that
                the O&amp;E Functional Engagement and Support document describes
                the engagement accountabilities for the Project Manager, Project
                Engineering Manager and the Integration Manager. The documents
                and records examined confirmed adequate communication between
                the O&amp;E integrity personnel and Major Projects personnel.

                Summary: Organizational Structure, Roles and Responsibilities
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;3.1, Organizational
                Structure, Roles and Responsibilities, requires a company to
                have an organizational structure that allows its management and
                protection programs to effectively function. It also requires
                companies to have clear roles and responsibilities, which may
                include responsibilities for the implementation of these
                programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has approximately 310&nbsp;employees performing work
                related to its integrity management programs across its Canadian
                pipeline system. This is complemented by approximately 80 field
                technicians who execute integrity-related activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit determined that for gas and liquid pipeline IMPs,
                roles and responsibilities are well-defined and have adequate,
                dedicated resources. The audit also assessed TransCanada’s
                revised plant IMP, now known as the Facility, Integrity and
                Reliability Management Program (FIRM), and found that it
                addresses the roles and responsibilities that were lacking in
                the previous version.

              <p>
                During interviews and in documents submitted, TransCanada stated
                that it has a documented training program for employees and
                internal contractors related to its Integrity Management
                Programs (IMPs). TransCanada indicated that training
                requirements for external contractors are specified within its
                service contracts that are verified through inspections and
                supervision by TransCanada personnel.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada uses the following methods to manage the training
                and qualification of employees, and in some instances internal
                contractors:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Learning Management System (LMS);</li>
                <li>Active Management;</li>
                <li>Practice of Engineering (POE); and</li>

              <h6 id="s3_3_3_1_1"><em>Learning Management System</em></h6>
              <p>
                The LMS is a web-based tool used to manage the training and
                competency evaluation for TransCanada employees and internal
                contractors. LMS is also used to document the results of
                technical tasks evaluated through three competency evaluation
                methods (Manager Review, Discuss and Describe, and Jobsite
                Observation), which are discussed below. Any worker who has not
                been deemed competent or qualified for a particular task is
                prohibited from independently performing that task.
              </p>
              <h6 id="s3_3_3_1_2"><em>Field Role Technical Competency</em></h6>
              <p>
                In&nbsp;2011, TransCanada introduced its Field Role Task
                Evaluation Project to improve the quality of the learning,
                development and competency evaluation programs related to
                field-based work. The competency evaluation method and training
                requirements for field technical tasks utilizes a model
                developed by the Canadian Gas Association and has been adapted
                for TransCanada’s use. For field role evaluations, interviews or
                jobsite task observations or simulations are required to
                demonstrate competency. TransCanada uses three methods of
                competency evaluation:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Manager Review - Applies to low risk level task evaluations.
                  Under this method of evaluation, the manager, in consultation
                  with a Qualified Technician, will approve task competency of
                  the employee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Discuss and Describe - Applies to medium risk level task
                  evaluations. Under this method of evaluation, the manager will
                  approve task competency of an employee based on a successful
                  interview evaluation conducted by a qualified evaluator.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Jobsite Observation - Applies to high risk level task
                  evaluations. Under this method of evaluation, the manager will
                  approve task competency of the employee based on successful
                  jobsite task simulation or performance in the presence of a
                  qualified evaluator.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6 id="s3_3_3_1_3"><em>Active Management</em></h6>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s leadership is responsible for ensuring that its
                employees and internal contractors are properly trained and
                competent to perform their assigned tasks. Managers complete
                this by actively assigning and monitoring work, providing
                feedback and reviewing staff competency on an ongoing basis.

                checkers. The Engineer-in-Charge is accountable for ensuring
                that personnel carrying out engineering work are qualified and
                competent to do so for the jurisdiction in which the engineering
                and construction are occurring.

              <p>
                During the audit interviews and document review, TransCanada
                stated that it monitors and manages employee development and
                training through its Performance Management Process (PMP), which
                is used to establish annual performance expectations and
                document the development and training plan of each employee. The
                PMP identifies employee development requirements, including
                training. Adjustments are made to an employee’s development plan
                to meet evolving job requirements, as required. Performance
                management, specifically related to pipe integrity, is
                documented in TEP-INT-COMP Pipe Integrity Hiring, Training and
                Competency Evaluation Procedure (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;007379172),
                that outlines the methodology used to identify and communicate
                training requirements and evaluation of competency. Records of
                training and competency, which were reviewed during the audit,
                are provided in Element&nbsp;4.1 Inspection, Measurement and
                Monitoring, as they applied to TransCanada’s programs.

              <p>
                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;3.3, Training,
                Competence and Evaluation, requires a company to have a
                documented training program for employees and contractors
                related to the company’s management and protection programs.
                Training program should include program-specific policies,
                emergency preparedness, environmental response and information
                on the potential consequences of not responding appropriately.
                Training must also evaluate the competency to ensure knowledge
                requirements have been met.

                During interviews and in documents submitted, TransCanada stated
                that it establishes and maintains processes to develop,
                implement and communicate surveillance and condition monitoring,
                and preventive, protective, mitigative, and remedial measures to
                address identified risks and threats.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once TransCanada has completed its risk analysis and threat
                identification, integrity actions are selected to control and
                manage identified and potential threats. The selected actions
                are documented in TransCanada’s annual Pipe and Facility
                Maintenance Plans (Maintenance Plans). Following implementation
                of the Maintenance Plans, the results are analyzed as part of
                TransCanada’s improvement cycle. The audit confirmed that the
                processes for the development of the Maintenance Plans are
                documented in TransCanada’s Integrity Management Programs
                (IMPs). The relevant sections of the IMPs are:

              <h5 id="s3_6_3_4">Protective Measures</h5>
              <p>
                Physical protective measures are intended to guard the pipeline
                and facilities equipment against damage and failure. Coatings
                are an example of protective measures, as they are intended to
                separate the pipe from sources of corrosion. The consensus in
                industry is that corrosion prevention is most effective when a
                high integrity coating is used in conjunction with cathodic
                protection. The Board reviewed TransCanada’s Corrosion
                Prevention Program (TEP-CP-PRGM, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006786483,
                TES-CP-CR Cathodic Protection Criteria Specification
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;00378793, and TES-CP-SS Cathodic Protection
                Survey Specification EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003670956) detailing the
                characteristics of its program to mitigate corrosion on
                protected structures using cathodic protection and assessed it
                to be adequate.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s3_6_3_5">Mitigative Measures</h5>
              <p>
                Mitigation methods are intended to reduce failure probability or
                failure consequences, and include methods such as pressure
                reduction, pipe material upgrades, slabbing over pipelines,
                increased backfill, equipment upgrades, pipeline rerouting,
                corrosion inhibitor injection, secondary containment and pig
                cleaning runs. The methods considered for risk reduction and
                threat control depend on the threat type. During the audit, the
                Board noted that TransCanada’s IMPs, as well as the Threat
                Management Programs, included adequate mitigative options to
                address potential threats and risks. For example, preventive and
                mitigative measures are detailed in Section&nbsp;9 of the Liquid
                Pipeline IMP.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s3_6_3_6">Remedial Measures</h5>
              <p>
                Remediation is completed to correct known issues, such as
                pipeline defects and excessive stresses due to geotechnical
                concerns (e.g. ground movement). Data inputs, such as defect
                assessments, hydrostatic testing, monitoring measurements, and
                indirect examination results are analyzed to identify areas
                requiring further investigation and/or repairs. During the
                audit, the Board noted that TransCanada’s Threat Management
                Programs and IMPs reference specific procedures for gathering
                additional data, analyzing monitoring and assessment results,
                and assessed them as being adequate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit examined examples of TransCanada’s procedures for
                analyzing in-line inspection results, where imperfections are
                evaluated to determine threats to the integrity of the pipeline.
                Special consideration is given to features such as dents, girth
                welds or seam welds that might be associated with other
                conditions. The following TransCanada procedures detail the
                approaches to analyze in-line inspection results:
              </p>
              <ul>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Activities such as direct evaluation and hydrostatic testing may
                be required to further characterize suspected and identified
                features. Methods of defect repair include recoating, pipe
                cut-outs and strain reliefs, as well as installation of sleeves,
                composite reinforcement wraps and clamps. Assessments and
                anticipated remedial measures are then included in TransCanada’s
                Maintenance Plans.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s3_6_3_7">Defect Assessment and Repair Procedures</h5>
              <p>
                For investigation of known or suspected features,
                non-destructive testing methods may be used, and might require
                pipeline exposure. A temporary reduction in operating pressure
                or other safety measures may be implemented to ensure that
                safety is maintained. Analysis of the data gathered in
                consideration of the design, material, construction, operating
                and maintenance history and expected operating conditions of the
                pipeline determines appropriate remediation and repair methods
                necessary to return the pipeline to full service. During the
                audit, the Board reviewed TransCanada’s procedures that are
                relevant to these activities:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  TOP Pipeline Restriction Procedure

                  TOP Pipeline Defect Assessment and Repair Procedures
                  (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003674615);
                </li>
                <li>
                  TOP Maximum Pressure for Pipelines With Known or Suspected
                  Integrity Concerns (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003671945); and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Assessment of Features in Pipelines (TEP-INT-FASS,

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board also reviewed records of TransCanada’s voluntary
                pressure restrictions that were in place during pipe exposure,
                defect assessment and repair and noted that TransCanada had
                followed its required procedures.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s3_6_3_8">Hydrotest Procedures for Defect Testing</h5>
              <p>
                Pressure testing is a method that produces a pass/fail result
                for defects contained in the pipeline test segment. Defects
                detected through pressure test failures are remediated by
                removal/replacement of the affected pipe segment. Hydrostatic
                Test Specification for Integrity Testing of Existing Pipelines
                (TES-HYDRO-HT4, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003697288) describes the
                procedure for pressure testing an existing pipeline to validate
                its suitability for continued operation at a previously
                qualified maximum operating pressure. During the audit, the
                Board reviewed TransCanada’s hydrotest procedure and assessed it
                as being adequate.

                Approving, Documenting and Communicating the Maintenance Plans
              </h5>
              <p>
                Maintenance Plans for the remedial activities described
                previously are presented to TransCanada management for review
                and approval. For Pipe Integrity, information on the Maintenance
                Plan is communicated as per Pipe Integrity Communication
                Procedure (TEP-INT-COMM, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006980248). The Vice
                President of Engineering and Asset Reliability approves the
                Maintenance Plans for Pipe Integrity and Facilities Integrity.
                Preventive maintenance work is communicated, documented and
                tracked in Avantis, which is a maintenance management system
                that is used by TransCanada.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s3_6_3_10">Maintenance Plan Implementation</h5>
              <p>
                Maintenance Plans are implemented by integrity personnel,
                central planning personnel, regional staff, and project managers
                of Pipeline Maintenance Projects, as appropriate. A program
                schedule is developed based on the urgency of risk reduction,
                operational efficiencies, resource and material availability and
                access. Repair or mitigation of known conditions may be
                scheduled independently of other activities if an urgent action
                is required. If a planned activity cannot be completed within
                the established timeframe, justification for the deferral and an
                explanation of why the change will not jeopardize integrity are
                documented through either a variance (System Improvement
                Decision Summary Variance Approval,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003909431) or a management of change

                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006425143), as appropriate. A temporary
                reduction in operating pressure or other appropriate actions may
                be required. Section&nbsp;12 of the Gas Pipeline IMP,
                Section&nbsp;7 of the Liquid Pipeline IMP, and Sections&nbsp;4
                and&nbsp;5 of the Plant IMP address implementation of the

              <h5 id="s3_6_3_11">Conducting Maintenance Plans</h5>
              <p>
                TransCanada stated that all surveillance and condition
                monitoring, as well as preventive, protective, mitigative and
                remedial activities, are conducted, managed and monitored in a
                manner that is intended to minimize environmental and safety
                risks. The Health, Safety and Environment (HS&amp;E) Management
                System (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003721961) contains more specific
                information on how these risks are managed. HS&amp;E was not in
                the scope of the audit and was therefore not assessed during
                this IMP audit.

                Evaluations of the effectiveness of Maintenance Plans are
                completed periodically by TransCanada’s Integrity Program
                Managers, Threat Program Managers, and Integrity Plan owners in
                consideration of the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>past and current assessment results;</li>

                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;3.6, Operational
                Control - Normal Operations, requires a company to establish and
                maintain a process to develop, implement and communicate
                measures meant to mitigate, prevent and protect against the
                hazards identified in sub-sections&nbsp;2.0 and&nbsp;3.0. This
                includes measures to proactively reduce or eliminate risks and
                hazards at their source.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit determined that TransCanada’s threat management
                programs provide a listing of appropriate integrity measures for
                managing identified risks and threats. Some of these threats
                include but are not limited to: pipeline corrosion; construction
                and manufacturing; weather and outside forces; and mechanical
                damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada was found to manage these risk and threats through
                in the following ways:

                  Preventative measures intended to eliminate or prevent the
                  presence of threats such as improved material selection,
                  public awareness activities and signage;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Physical protective measures intended to protect
                  infrastructure from damage and failure such as pipeline

                </li>
                <li>
                  Mitigation measures to reduce the probability of failure and
                  related consequences such as pipeline rerouting, pressure

                During interviews and in documents submitted, TransCanada stated
                that it has the operational controls and procedures that are to
                be followed to identify the potential for operational upset or
                abnormal operating conditions, and it has developed the plans
                and procedures to prevent and mitigate the impacts of these
                upset or abnormal operating events. TransCanada also submitted
                procedures that would be implemented in response to pipeline and
                facilities upset or abnormal operating conditions, including
                accidental releases, incidents or emergency situations.
                TransCanada’s emergency response plan (ERP) was not within the
                scope of this audit and was therefore not assessed during this
                IMP audit.

                The Keystone Pipeline is remotely monitored and controlled from
                TransCanada’s Calgary based Oil Control Centre (OCC). Pipeline
                controllers at the OCC are responsible for the overall operation
                of the pipeline 24&nbsp;hours a day, 365&nbsp;days a year.
                Pipeline controllers monitor critical data points along the
                pipeline and are able to issue supervisory commands such as pump
                start/stop and valve open/close commands using a computerized
                Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. To
                address service reliability, the OCC has fully redundant SCADA
                and leak detection systems. In the event of a SCADA or leak
                detection system failure, a hot standby system will immediately
                take over. If both the OCC primary and standby systems become
                unavailable due to a catastrophic event, a secondary Back-Up
                Control Centre contains full duplicate primary and secondary
                SCADA and leak detection systems. CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Annex&nbsp;M
                (Informative), Guidance for System Control, Monitoring and
                Protection of Liquid Pipelines, provides non-mandatory guidance
                for the use of SCADA. TransCanada’s use of a SCADA system for
                the Keystone Pipeline conforms to this non-mandatory guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Keystone Pipeline is operated in accordance with its written
                operating procedures for normal, abnormal and emergency
                operations. TransCanada stated that the procedures comply with
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.5.2, Pipeline Emergencies. OCC
                procedures are documented and available to the OCC controllers
                via an internal OCC website. The OCC procedures include normal
                operations, abnormal/emergency operations, leak detection
                operations and incident management. The OCC emergency procedures
                were outside the scope of this IMP audit and were not formally

                TransCanada’s gas pipeline operations are remotely monitored and
                controlled from the Calgary Gas Control (GC) Centre. Pipeline
                controllers are responsible for the overall operation of the

                TransCanada’s gas pipeline system is operated in accordance with
                written operating procedures for normal, abnormal and emergency
                operations. TransCanada stated that the procedures comply with
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.5.2, Pipeline Emergencies. Gas
                Control consists of two processes, the Monitor and Control
                Process (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003835728) and the Emergency
                Preparedness and Response Process
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003835729). The Monitor and Control Process
                describes the methodology used to ensure that the 24-hour
                operation of the pipeline system is carried out under controlled
                conditions. The Emergency Preparedness and Response (ERP)
                Process describes the methodology used to ensure programs,
                processes and plans are in place to ensure controlled responses
                to emergency situations. While TransCanada provided information
                on its emergency preparedness and response program, its ERP
                program was not formally assessed in this IMP audit.

              <p>
                During the audit interviews, TransCanada stated that its pump
                stations are equipped with an ESD system that is designed to
                automatically isolate the station from the pipeline upon the
                occurrence of abnormal conditions. An ESD event will result in
                the immediate shutdown of all pumps, both the mainline pumps as
                well as sump re-injection pumps. Once the pumps have shut down,
                the station mainline bypass valve opens and station suction and
                discharge side valves close. The station valves are interlocked
                so that the station suction and discharge side valves do not
                close until the station mainline bypass valve is fully open.
                Once a pump station is in emergency shutdown, it is locked out
                to the OCC until the incident is investigated and cleared by a
                facility technician. An &quot;Isolate&quot; command is also
                available to the OCC and is intended for non-emergency isolation
                at the pump station. This will result in the station bypass
                valve opening and the side valves closing, but will not lock out
                the facility to the OCC. Similar ESD systems are in place at oil
                receipt facilities.

                On 6-9&nbsp;June,&nbsp;2011, NEB staff conducted an inspection
                of Keystone’s Portage La Prairie, Rapid City, Moosomin and
                Richardson pump stations located in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
                The inspection revealed that the pump stations on the Keystone
                system are not equipped with an alternate source of power
                capable of operating each station’s ESD system and NEB staff

                action plan to address a non-compliance to the OPR-99
                sub-section&nbsp;12(a). TransCanada had been found non-complaint
                with the OPR-99 sub-section&nbsp;12(<em>a</em>) because it did
                not have an alternate source of power capable of operating its

              <p>
                Pump station suction and discharge pressures are controlled via
                a combination of pump speed control and pressure control valve
                modulation. The majority of pump stations are fitted with
                variable frequency drives to control pump speed, and all pump
                stations are fitted with a pressure control valve on the
                discharge side of the pump station. Upon loss of the control
                system, all pumps at that station will trip and SCADA will drive
                the upstream pump station to safe discharge pressure settings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pump station suction and discharge pressures are monitored by
                the local facility control system and the SCADA system for
                over-pressure conditions. If suction pressures exceed safe
                limits, all pumps at all stations upstream of the station with
                the high suction pressure will be immediately shut down. If
                discharge pressures exceed safe limits, all pumps at that
                station will be immediately shut down. If the SCADA system
                detects a blocked flow path (such as a valve closure) anywhere
                on the pipeline, then all pumps at all stations upstream of the

                TransCanada’s Gas Control Over-Pressure Procedure
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003723302) references six levels of
                protection to prevent pipeline over-pressure. Four levels of
                protection take place at compressor station locations and
                protect against over-pressure conditions that are initiated by
                the compressor station only. The fifth and sixth levels of
                protection, which augment the compressor station controls,
                protect against other sources of pipeline over-pressure. If an
                over-pressure condition occurs, a station’s programmable logic
                controllers (PLCs) has the ability to slow down the operating
                parameters of the unit, shut down the unit completely, or
                relieve the pressure via unit or station relief valves.
                TransCanada stated that typically, over-pressure protection is

                The NEB has reviewed TransCanada’s past incident history and
                identified over-pressure incidents on the NGTL system. Through
                an Audit Information Request and audit interviews with
                TransCanada, TransCanada was asked to demonstrate how the NGTL
                approach of relying on its customers and NGTL’s General Terms
                and Agreement (GTA) meets the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;4.18 and the OPR-99 sections&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;53(1).
                In addition, NGTL was asked whether it had implemented the
                preventative actions highlighted in the NEB’s Safety Advisory
                (NEB&nbsp;SA99-1), which referenced the requirements of
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;4.18.1.2, on OPP at Receipt
                Points, issued in September&nbsp;1999.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada stated that, as a result of its over-pressure
                incidents, it had initiated a review of how its customers meet
                the GTA. TransCanada stated that in December&nbsp;2010 it
                implemented a procedure for new meter stations that verifies
                that the customer’s OPP meets CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 requirements.
                TransCanada stated that it has reviewed its customers’
                philosophies concerning how they meet the GTA for 30 receipt
                meter stations and that it is currently developing a plan to
                verify compliance to OPP requirements on approximately
                1100&nbsp;additional receipt meter stations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, TransCanada indicated that in February&nbsp;2012, it
                had communicated the following OPP Plan of Action to its
                customers:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  TransCanada will re-initiate verification of its OPP
                  requirements with NGTL customers in April&nbsp;2013.
                </li>
                <li>
                  NGTL stakeholders (including customers) will be informed at
                  that time that in order to be compliant with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                  the OPR-99 and NEB Safety Advisories, NGTL will require
                  information from all Interconnecting Operators at receipt
                  meter stations regarding the status of their OPP Systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Failure to provide adequate information regarding the status
                  of the Interconnecting Operator’s OPP System may ultimately
                  result in either the shut-in of the receipt stations, or
                  installation at the customer’s cost of OPP systems at the NGTL
                  receipt stations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A risk-based methodology is used to determine the meter
                  station information required to allow both TransCanada and its
                  customers to prioritize the meter stations under initial
                  review in&nbsp;2013. The balance of the meter station
                  information will be required and reviewed by the end
                  of&nbsp;2014.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Currently, meter stations with one or more of the following
                  characteristics are prioritized to provide OPP information:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The meter station has an automated block valve;</li>
                    <li>
                      The meter station has had a prior over-pressure event; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The meter station has one or more producer tie-ins where
                      there are a number of unclear areas on how to ensure OPP.
                      In such cases OPP information will be required from all of
                      the applicable upstream operators.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on the history of over-pressure incidents on the NGTL
                system, the fact that TransCanada only recently initiated a Plan
                of Action to verify compliance with the OPP requirements of
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;4.18, and the fact that the Plan
                of Action has not been fully implemented, TransCanada is not in
                compliance with this audit sub-element.

                Overhaul Maintenance for Oil Pipelines Procedure
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;007603025), and in accordance with
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.9.5.3. TransCanada is currently
                assembling the supporting evidentiary data as required by
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.9.5.3(b) to assess and justify
                an appropriate alternate pressure-relief system inspection and

                The audit identified that settings for mechanical relief valves,
                as well as pressure relief set-points coded into the control
                system, are managed according to TransCanada’s document

              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada stated that it overhauls
                conventional and pilot-operated pressure relief valves at three
                or five-year intervals, in accordance with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,

              </p>
              <p>
                The audit determined that TransCanada is moving to a five-year
                inspection and maintenance interval for its pressure-relief
                inspection and maintenance program, as it assesses the
                requirements for each site under its internal audit process
                according to the TOP Pressure Relief Valve Audit Procedure
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003954090). TransCanada’s Pressure Equipment
                Quality Management System (QMS) and CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;10.9.5.3(b) both require TransCanada to review the
                equipment to justify extension of inspection intervals.
                TransCanada stated that, to date, no incidents have listed the
                longer pressure-relief inspection and maintenance interval as a
                contributing factor, and no increase in relief valve incidents
                have occurred since the move to the longer interval was
                initiated. Based on the evidentiary data and documentation as
                required by CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.9.5.3(b),
                TransCanada’s rationale for the increased inspection interval is
                in compliance with requirements for pressure-relief valve
                inspection and maintenance.

              <h5 id="s3_7_3_7_1"><em>Oil Operations</em></h5>
              <p>
                The audit identified that TransCanada’s leak detection
                methodology on oil systems is performed via a computerized Leak
                Detection system that alerts the Oil Control Centre (OCC)
                controller of any suspected leak event, so that the controller
                can take appropriate action to shut down and isolate the
                pipeline system. In addition, aerial patrols are performed 26
                times a year (TOP Aerial Pipeline Patrol,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003672387). If a leak is identified during an
                aerial patrol, the OCC is notified to immediately shut down and
                isolate the system. CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;11.18, Leak
                Detection, requires that
                <em

                  systems. Leak detection devices and procedures, where used,
                  shall be capable of providing early detection of leaks. Where
                  appropriate, line balance methods may be used.&quot;</em
                >
                TransCanada’s leak detection system for its oil operations is in
                compliance with the CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 requirements.

              <h5 id="s3_7_3_7_2"><em>Gas Operations</em></h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada stated that if a leak is detected
                or suspected on a gas pipeline, the guidance provided under the
                Pressure Control of Leaking Pipelines
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003841207) is followed to manage the
                confirmed or suspected leak. Leak detection on gas pipeline
                systems is also performed via regularly scheduled aerial and
                ground based patrols in accordance with the Natural Gas Leak
                Detection Procedure (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003676669) and the
                Pipeline Integrity Leak Detection and Evaluation Procedure
                (TEP-INT-LEAK, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;007379105). These procedures
                describe the requirements to perform natural gas leak detection
                activities. CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;11.18, Leak Detection,
                requires that

              <h5 id="s3_7_3_8">Gas Quality</h5>
              <p>
                As mentioned in the audit sub-element&nbsp;4.1 Inspection,
                Measurement and Monitoring, TransCanada has identified key
                personnel, such as field technicians and gas controllers, who
                are trained to identify and manage gas quality off-specification
                Tariff conditions. The governance and systematic approach to
                managing gas quality are outlined in the Gas Quality Procedure
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003671916) and the H<sub>2</sub>S Risk
                Mitigation Procedure (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003999947). At
                locations where sour potential or other contaminants are of
                concern, additional instrumentation and automated equipment is
                employed with shut-in capability. In the event that a sour gas
                slug is introduced to the pipeline system, the Alberta and
                Foothills System H<sub>2</sub>S Contamination Procedure
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003723279) provides procedures and
                guidelines for Gas Control to manage the H<sub>2</sub>S
                contamination event. Records of TransCanada’s gas quality
                monitoring program were examined in conjunction with the
                assessment of the Internal Corrosion Threat Management Program
                (Ref_2_2012 IC Susceptible Lines.xlsx). The programs that
                TransCanada has developed and implemented to manage gas quality
                are in compliance with the requirements of the OPR-99,
                section&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>e</em>) and&nbsp;(<em>f</em>).

              <h5 id="s3_7_3_9">Fire and High Gas Concentration Detection</h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada stated that all stations are
                equipped with sensors to continuously monitor for both fire (gas
                and oil facilities) and high gas concentrations (gas facilities
                only), as per CSA&nbsp;Z662-11. Clause&nbsp;4.14.2.7 states that
                <em
                  >&quot;compressor buildings shall have suitable systems for
                  the detection of fire and hazardous atmospheres&quot;</em

                and Clause&nbsp;4.14.3.5 states that
                <em
                  >&quot;pump buildings shall have suitable systems for the
                  detection of fire and hazardous atmosphere&quot;</em
                >. TransCanada stated that, as directed by its Fire Detection
                Equipment Inspection Procedure (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;005018693),
                the fire and gas detection equipment are tested and calibrated
                on prescribed maintenance schedules, typically annually or
                bi-annually, depending on the type of detection equipment. Fire
                and gas detection equipment are on an annual inspection and
                maintenance interval. Catalytic gas detectors have a known
                susceptibility to gas &quot;poisoning&quot; over time, which may
                reduce their ability to detect gas. Although catalytic gas
                detectors are not typically exposed to gas during normal
                operations, bi-annual inspections are prescribed by TransCanada
                as a preventive measure.

                In terms of the applicable regulatory requirements for an
                inspection schedule, CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 remains silent on the
                inspection and maintenance interval requirements as does the
                American Petroleum Institute (API) and the National Research
                Council Canada (National Fire Code of Canada, 2010). In general
                terms, the OPR-99 section&nbsp;36(<em>b</em>), states that
                &quot;A company shall periodically test instruments and
                equipment at the pipeline stations to verify their proper and
                safe operation.&quot;<sup

                >
                TransCanada’s inspection and maintenance program frequencies for
                its fire and gas monitoring equipment are therefore assessed to
                be compliant with these requirements.

              <h5 id="s3_7_3_10">Alarm Call-Out System</h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada identified its gas control and oil
                control personnel who monitor the pipeline system and
                acknowledge all alarms that come in through the SCADA system.
                The alarms are grouped in &quot;bundles&quot; that allow the
                operator to identify from which sub-system the alarm originates.
                The operator then notifies the appropriate field personnel to
                respond to and investigate the alarm. Gas Control direction is
                provided under the Alarm and Event Management Procedure
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003821127). Oil Control direction is
                provided via various procedures available on the OCC web page.
                TransCanada’s alarm call-out system relates to its emergency
                preparedness and response program, which was not included in the
                scope of this audit and therefore not formally assessed.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s3_7_3_11">Shutdown Devices and Systems</h5>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada stated that each compressor and
                pump station contains instrumentation and controls which include
                pressure transmitters, pressure switches, mainline valve
                pressure switches, blow-off valve high-pressure switches, level
                switches and mainline pressure and temperature transmitters. To
                ensure the equipment is configured and functions correctly,
                guidance is provided under the Control and Monitoring Inspection
                Procedure (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003834760). CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;10.9, Operation and Maintenance of Facilities and
                Equipment, and more specifically, sub-clause&nbsp;10.9.1,
                Compressor and Pump Stations, states that
                <em
                  >&quot;gas compressor and pump units shall be started,
                  operated, and shut down in accordance with procedures
                  established by the operating company&quot;</em
                >. TransCanada’s shutdown devices and systems are in compliance
                with the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s3_7_3_12">Valve Operation</h5>
              <p>
                TransCanada stated that remotely located mainline valves on gas
                pipelines are equipped with low-pressure shut-off devices which,
                when a low-pressure condition is observed, will automatically
                close the valve isolating the pipeline section. Remote mainline
                valves on the Keystone Pipeline are electrically actuated and
                can be closed and opened, as required, via remote command from
                the OCC.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following procedures provide guidance to ensure that
                pipeline valves (oil and gas) operate as required during normal,

              <p>
                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;3.7, Operational
                Control - Upset or Abnormal Operating Conditions, requires a
                company to establish and maintain procedures to identify
                potential upset or abnormal operating conditions, accidental
                releases, incidents and emergency situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has implemented a number of processes and procedures
                to identify potential upset or abnormal operating conditions.
                TransCanada’s pipeline infrastructure is monitored remotely
                24&nbsp;hours a day, 365&nbsp;days a year using a Supervisory
                Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and is backed up by
                an onsite standby system. In the event that both of these
                systems fail due to a catastrophic event, a secondary control
                centre at a different location contains full duplicate primary
                and secondary back-up systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit also found that TransCanada’s pressure-limiting and
                relieving systems, leak detection, gas quality, alarm call-out,
                shutdown devices and valve operation systems were all adequate
                and compliant with the OPR-99 and CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                While over-pressure protection for TransCanada’s oil pipeline
                systems was found to be adequate, the Board has determined the
                NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd (NGTL) system is not conducting
                sufficient inspections or audits of its customer installations
                to ensure that the system is operated in compliance with the
                OPR-99 and CSA-Z662-11 requirements. Based on that system’s
                history of over-pressure incidents and the fact that TransCanada
                has not fully implemented its plan of action to verify
                compliance with requirements, the company is not in compliance
                with the OPR-99 and CSA-Z662-11 requirements and is therefore
                not in compliance with this audit sub-element.

              <p>
                During interviews and in documents submitted, TransCanada
                indicated that it has developed and implemented surveillance and
                monitoring programs to address the hazards and risks to its
                pipeline systems. TransCanada’s Engineering and Asset
                Reliability (E&amp;AR) department is accountable for identifying
                the relevant programs and for ensuring adherence of these
                programs to applicable regulations. Subsequent trending and
                evaluation of the programs provide input to ensure continued
                effectiveness of the Integrity Management Programs (IMPs).
              </p>
              <p>
                It was noted that TransCanada’s processes for monitoring and
                analyzing hazards are identified within the Quality Management,
                Quality Assurance and Management Review sections of
                TransCanada’s IMPs.

              <h6 id="s4_1_3_2_1"><em>Gas Quality Monitoring</em></h6>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada identified personnel, such as
                field technicians and gas controllers, who are trained to
                identify and manage gas quality off-specification conditions.
                The governance and systematic approach to managing gas quality
                are outlined in the Gas Quality Procedure
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003671916). At locations where sour
                potential is of concern, additional instrumentation, sour
                bottles and automated equipment are employed to ensure that
                off-specification gas (&gt;16&nbsp;ppm&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>S) does
                not enter the mainline or reach a sales location.
              </p>
              <p>Testing methods used to manage the gas quality can include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>manual water and hydrocarbon dew points;</li>
                <li>
                  gas samples (carbon dioxide, oxygen, and heating value);
                </li>
                <li>
                  hydrogen sulphide and total sulphur screening via gas samples
                  and on-line instrumentation;
                </li>
                <li>
                  objectionable material detection via dew point monitoring;
                </li>
                <li>orifice plate inspection;</li>
                <li>H<sub>2</sub>S gas sniffer analysis; and</li>
                <li>scrubber and meter run inspections.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are currently 292 receipt meter stations with
                H<sub>2</sub>S protection on the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.
                (NGTL) system. The TransCanada philosophy for sour meter station
                design is to monitor, control, contain, and reject a customer’s
                gas if off-specification gas is detected. In addition, all
                receipt and delivery meter stations are screened monthly via gas
                samples for H<sub>2</sub>S and total sulphur levels, and sweet
                stations are tested monthly through H<sub>2</sub>S gas sniffer
                tubes. Several mainline H<sub>2</sub>S analyzers are also
                installed throughout the NGTL system to detect potential
                H<sub>2</sub>S slugs that may have entered the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified that all TransCanada meter stations and
                compressor stations contain gas scrubber equipment. Any
                recovered liquids are measured on a regular basis. Excessive
                liquid recovery prompts the applicable customer to rectify the
                problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Non-sour off-specification conditions are managed directly with
                the customers and may include shutting in the customer until the
                off-specification condition is rectified. As outlined in the
                TransCanada Operating Procedure (TOP) Meter Station General
                Maintenance Gas Transmission (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003834481), the
                typical visitation schedule at TransCanada meter stations is
                monthly unless otherwise specified. TransCanada stated that the
                program is considered to be effective as there are no known
                internal corrosion defects caused by off-specification gas
                conditions. The absence of significant defects caused by
                internal corrosion was confirmed during the audit of the
                Internal Corrosion Threat Management Program.

                With respect to specific requirements for gas quality
                specifications and monitoring, CSA&nbsp;Z661-11 remains silent.
                The requirements for gas quality fall under identification of

              <p>
                Sediment and water (S&amp;W) is a measure of the residual
                unwanted impurities (water and particulate matter) that are
                contained in crude oil, which is applicable to the Keystone
                Pipeline. TransCanada stated that every oil batch is tested for
                compliance with an S&amp;W maximum of 0.5% of volume as per
                Article 4.2(ii) of the Keystone Petroleum Tariff agreements. In
                addition to the manual testing used for custody transfer, the
                Hardisty terminal is equipped with an online water cut analyzer
                to continuously measure the receipt water cut, to ensure that
                off-spec product does not enter the pipeline undetected. Beyond
                efforts to minimize S&amp;W within the product stream, samples
                of crude and sediment (sludge) were collected from early
                cleaning runs across the Keystone Pipeline system in order to
                assess its corrosivity. TransCanada identified that the exposure
                tests using these samples validated that, in the absence of
                sludge, and exposed to pipeline crude only, the corrosion rate
                was negligible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Information reviewed identified that the Keystone Pipeline
                system was designed to minimize the potential for sediment
                accumulation by having a nominal flow rate that generates a
                turbulent flow regime (maintains water and sediment suspended
                and entrained in the crude). Typically, sediment deposition is
                unavoidable during situations such as line fill and initial
                start-up. Accordingly, cleaning tools were run the entire length
                of the system twice after initial start-up. As well, a cleaning
                tool is also run prior to each in-line inspection (ILI) run. By
                early&nbsp;2013 all ILI metal loss runs on the Keystone Pipeline
                system in Canada will be completed. Re-inspection is currently
                scheduled on a five-year interval. The ILI data is specifically
                reviewed for indicators of the initiation and presence of
                internal corrosion. TransCanada stated that none of the ILI data
                to date has exhibited evidence of internal, under-sediment
                corrosion. This was confirmed during the audit of the Internal
                Corrosion Threat Management Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another consideration in the design of the Keystone Pipeline was
                the minimization of dead legs, with normal flow through the
                barrels as one manifestation of this approach. Corrosion
                monitoring will be performed to confirm ongoing applicability of
                initial exposure tests during scheduled facility inspections, as
                per Keystone Facility Piping Non Destructive Inspection
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006790574).

              <p>
                In its February&nbsp;2013 response to an Audit Information
                Request, TransCanada indicated that the crude oil it carries in
                the Keystone Pipeline does not constitute sour service. During
                the audit, TransCanada could not demonstrate that the crude oil
                it carries in the Keystone Pipeline did not constitute sour
                service (as defined by CSA&nbsp;Z662-11), since it had not
                conducted any testing to verify the partial pressure of the
                H<sub>2</sub>S at the bubble point absolute pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subsequently, in April&nbsp;2013, TransCanada committed to
                implement a sampling program to verify the H<sub>2</sub>S
                content of all the products it carries on the Keystone Pipeline.
                In June&nbsp;2013, TransCanada indicated that it had tested all
                of its regularly shipped commodities using the standard method
                Universal Oil Products (UOP) 163-10, which is a potentiometric
                titration method, to verify the H<sub>2</sub>S content of the
                crude oil. All of the commodity tests produced a modeled partial
                H<sub>2</sub>S pressure less than 0.3&nbsp;kPa and therefore
                confirmed the non-sour nature of these products. TransCanada’s
                report stated that given the conservative nature of the test,
                additional testing of these products is not intended at this
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the fact that TransCanada has not monitored the
                H<sub>2</sub>S content of the different batches of products it
                carries on the Keystone Pipeline, and based on the fact that
                TransCanada’s planned practice is not to monitor the
                H<sub>2</sub>S content of the different batches of products it
                carries, or will carry in the future, on the Keystone Pipeline,
                TransCanada is not in compliance with the requirements of this
                audit sub-element and CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;3.2.

              <p>
                TransCanada’s documentation indicated that the risk assessment
                and risk management of the external corrosion threat are
                achieved using either of the following two approaches:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  For pipelines where an in-line inspection (ILI) has been
                  completed, the specific anomalies are assessed, and control or
                  mitigation activities are planned based on a defect management
                  approach.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For pipelines where ILI has not been completed, risk
                  mitigation activities are determined based on TransCanada’s
                  risk assessment results (PRIME), subject matter expertise, and
                  applied learnings from other similar segments of pipe across
                  the TransCanada system, including historical performance.

              <p>
                In terms of the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) system, it is
                mostly un-piggable (approximately 25% of the NGTL system has
                been in-line inspected). TransCanada’s 2013 results from PRIME
                for the NGTL System indicated that 234&nbsp;pipeline segments
                exceeded TransCanada’s stated risk tolerance. The PRIME
                technical documentation, Section&nbsp;4, Consequence Models,
                contains TransCanada’s Societal Risk Acceptance Curve (FN). The
                Unacceptable Region of the FN curve is where the Societal Risk
                does not meet TransCanada’s Individual or Societal Risk criteria
                and these segments are prioritized for risk-reduction activities
                in the current year’s program.
              </p>
              <p>
                For NGTL’s un-piggable segments, mitigation programs should
                normally be applied to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
                Documentation submitted by TransCanada indicated that not all of
                the pipeline segments in the NGTL system exceeding TransCanada’s
                risk tolerance had mitigation plans for&nbsp;2013. According to
                documents reviewed, 160 of the 234&nbsp;pipeline segments of the
                NGTL system exceeding TransCanada’s risk tolerances and had no
                mitigation plans for&nbsp;2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada was asked to justify the absence
                of mitigation plans for these 160&nbsp;pipeline segments. In
                response, TransCanada provided modified risk assessment results
                indicating that these segments were now acceptable to
                TransCanada’s risk criteria. TransCanada explained that its
                modified risk assessment process includes information gathered
                after inspecting (ILI or direct examination) nearby pipelines in
                similar condition. The nearby pipeline conditions are now
                factored in the probability component of the risk assessment,
                with the result being that all but one of the 160&nbsp;pipeline
                segments had acceptable risk results. TransCanada indicated that
                there are no further mitigation plans for any of the
                160&nbsp;segments, except for the one segment that still
                exceeded TransCanada’s risk tolerance with the new risk
                assessment process and for which TransCanada had added a
                mitigation plan for&nbsp;2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada did not provide evidence proving the validity of its
                new risk assessment methodology of using nearby or parallel
                pipeline information as an adequate way to monitor the integrity
                of its pipeline segments. The Board notes that this methodology
                is not an industry recognized method for determining the
                integrity of a pipeline, as opposed to recognized methods such
                as ILI, hydrotesting or the NACE External Corrosion Direct
                Assessment (ECDA) Process. Whether corrosion occurs or not, or
                is severe or not corrosive, is specific to the local conditions
                of the pipeline and the pipeline’s interaction with its
                surrounding environment. Several factors such as manufacturing
                process, construction practices, cathodic protection (CP)
                levels, soil type and composition, moisture levels, mechanical
                damage (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>,
                3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;parties or pipe/soil movements) could affect
                the condition of the pipe coating, all of which could affect the
                susceptibility of the segments to external corrosion. Nearby
                pipeline conditions can give an indication of the potential
                corrosivity of an area and conditions of a pipeline, but it is
                not information that can be relied on to effectively demonstrate
                the integrity of a pipeline. As such, the Board is of the
                opinion that nearby or parallel pipeline information cannot be
                used directly in the risk assessment process.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s monitoring programs for external corrosion on
                these un-piggable pipeline segments is limited to the
                <em>Corrosion Control Surveys</em> section covered later in this
                section. While these programs are common industry practices,
                monitoring CP systems alone is not a recognized practice for
                thoroughly assessing the effectiveness of the CP system, which
                is typically done with pipe-to-soil close interval surveys.
                Also, for pipelines coated with shielding coatings such as PE
                Tape, which is the coating on many of TransCanada’s un-piggable
                segments, CP can be ineffective at preventing corrosion under a
                disbonded coating condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Relying on nearby or parallel pipeline information and CP
                monitoring as described in the
                <em>Corrosion Control Surveys</em> section below is not an
                adequate monitoring method of the external corrosion threat of
                the un-piggable or non-hydrotested pipelines on the NGTL system.
                Therefore, TransCanada is assessed to be in non-compliance with
                this audit element and CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;3.2.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the NGTL un-piggable pipeline systems have been
                characterized by TransCanada as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For small diameter pipelines (&lt;20&quot;):

                <li>
                  For large diameter pipelines (&gt;20&quot;):

                In terms of its current activities and forward plans to address
                un-piggable pipelines, the Board notes that TransCanada has
                provided the following information:

              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada’s information indicated that the
                TransCanada Pipe Integrity group is responsible for managing and
                administering the corrosion control programs for pipeline, pump
                station and terminal facilities. CP readings are performed by
                Regional field personnel either at site or via remote
                monitoring. The requirement for corrosion control monitoring, as
                outlined in CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;9, is detailed in
                TransCanada Operating Procedures (TOPs) Cathodic Protection
                Rectifier Inspection (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;004258831), Cathodic
                Protection Survey Inspection (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;004258833), and
                Cathodic Protection Rectifier and Bond Reading Inspection
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;004258832).
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure the proper operation of its CP system, TransCanada
                inspects all impressed current facilities twelve times in a
                calendar year, not to exceed an interval of 6 weeks. Annual
                rectifier inspections are conducted, which involves reading AC
                inputs, calculating rectifier efficiency, conducting visual
                inspections and performing maintenance cleaning. Test lead
                surveys are performed annually to ensure all facilities are
                receiving adequate cathodic protection levels. In addition to
                monitoring CP facilities, CP isolation surveys are also
                undertaken on an annual basis to ensure the applicable
                facilities are not interfering with the normal operation of the
                CP system.
              </p>
              <p>
                When in-line inspection (ILI) data is unavailable, or to further
                monitor areas of potential concern, close interval surveys (CIS)
                are used to investigate performance of the cathodic protection
                system and to assess for external corrosion concerns. CIS
                surveys augment the annual test lead surveys by investigating CP
                protection levels between test leads. The requirement for these
                surveys is based on an engineering evaluation of the area in
                question. The criteria used to prioritize CIS requirements
                include previous CP history, Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) ILI
                results, type of coating, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and
                corrosion risk assessment results. TransCanada’s corrosion
                control survey methodology with respect to CP is assessed as
                compliant with the requirements of this audit sub-element.

                In the Unites States, the US Department of Transportation
                Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
                sets out the pipeline patrol requirements in the Code of Federal
                Regulations (CFR), Part&nbsp;192 - Transportation of Natural and
                Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards
                (49&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;192) in section&nbsp;192.705 and Part 195 -
                Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline
                (49&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;195) in section&nbsp;195.412. The United
                States regulations are mentioned because TransCanada has
                developed its pipeline patrol program to meet the most
                prescriptive requirements, which in terms of ROW patrol
                frequencies, are those set out in the 49 CFR 192 and 195.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, TransCanada indicated that it implements its
                pipeline patrols to meet at in accordance with the requirements
                of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1 Pipeline Patrolling.
                Aerial patrols are completed to look for construction activity,
                vegetation, signage, erosion, geotechnical concerns,
                encroachments, leaks, and water crossings. Patrol frequencies
                are outlined in the TOPs Aerial Pipeline Patrol
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003672387) and Pipeline Ground Based Patrols
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003875137). All natural gas pipelines are to
                be patrolled a minimum of two times per year. Liquid pipelines
                are to be patrolled 26 times per year. Additional patrols are to
                be completed at increased frequencies as warranted, based on a
                review of historic observations, levels of activity along the
                ROW, known integrity concerns, or as may be directed by the
                applicable regulator. Aerial patrols are to be executed with the
                use of helicopter or fixed wing aircraft as per the aircraft
                operating company assigned to complete the patrol. Aerial leak
                detection for natural gas pipeline systems is a component of the
                overall leak detection strategy, as are observations from
                landowners, contractors and employees working near the pipeline.
                Aerial leak detection is to be performed at least annually on
                natural gas pipeline systems, as described in Pipe Integrity
                Leak Detection and Evaluation (TEP-LEAK-INT,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;007379105). Aerial leak detection on gas
                pipeline systems is to be performed with the use of helicopters.
                Supplemental ground based leak patrols are to be initiated as
                per the TOP Pipeline Ground Based Patrols
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003875137) either when aerial patrol
                frequency does not meet the minimum regulatory requirements, or
                where anomalies identified during aerial leak detection require
                ground based confirmation.

                class location, highway and railroad crossings, levels of
                activity, integrity concerns and pipeline commodity. While
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.1 uses the term
                &quot;periodically&quot; and the OPR-99, section&nbsp;39 remains
                silent on the patrol frequency, TransCanada’s patrol frequencies
                are assessed to be in compliance with the intent of the standard
                and the regulation with respect to pipeline patrol frequency.

                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clauses&nbsp;10.6.1.1 and&nbsp;10.6.1.2. The
                Board examined a random aerial patrol record requested for an
                incident (OB9_Aerial Patrol Reported_DOC_IIT#233782) related to
                a sink hole at&nbsp;10-27-34-5W4 (Keystone Pipeline ROW)
                reported 23&nbsp;April&nbsp;2012 and noted that the record met
                the requirements for monitoring and reporting. TransCanada’s
                pipeline patrol TOPs have been developed to address the most
                stringent, prescriptive pipeline patrol requirements and have
                been assessed to be in compliance with the standard and
                regulation.

                for liquid facilities are designed to ensure that critical
                equipment is functioning as intended. Mechanical, electrical,
                civil and environmental components are to be inspected at
                intervals as described in these documents.

              <p>
                At liquid facilities, the Keystone Facility Piping Non
                Destructive Inspection (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006790574) Task
                Package is used. The purpose of this Non Destructive inspection
                package is to determine the condition of pressure piping and
                associated fittings, including the coating and insulation, and
                is designed to ensure fitness for service and proactively
                identify applicable maintenance requirements. TransCanada was
                assessed to be in compliance for its inspection program of its
                liquid facilities.

                As described in the following evaluation of TransCanada’s
                inspection program for high pressure station piping for its gas
                facilities, TransCanada’s previous facility pipe integrity
                program was managed under the Integrity Management Process for
                Pipelines (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003892900). Chapter&nbsp;7 of this
                document, Facility Pipe Integrity, contained sections which

                The Board is of the view that these generic background
                descriptions do not provide the level of specificity required
                for the implementation of an adequate and effective gas facility
                pipe inspection program. Therefore, as the following evaluation
                has concluded, TransCanada’s gas facility inspection program is
                not in compliance with the requirements of this audit element
                and with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;3.2.

                The audit identified that TransCanada utilizes different methods
                to monitor its facility piping integrity. The methods include
                regular site visits, annual CP surveys, visual inspection, and
                preventative maintenance activities such as valve and valve
                operator inspections. Visual inspection is performed at
                facilities during planned facility inspections, facility
                pipeline projects, and regular site visits. Hazardous or
                abnormal conditions, such as leaks or frost heaved piping, are
                to be checked for during site visits. Issues identified are to
                be communicated through the company Incident and Issue Tracking
                (IIT) system for follow-up. In regions where atmospheric
                corrosion is more of a concern due to a more humid environment,
                such as the Eastern region, a riser assessment program was
                recently implemented to assess external corrosion on the risers
                at the air-to-soil interfaces and other locations where
                atmospheric corrosion also could be present, such as between
                supports the piping. As part of the audit verification process,
                NEB staff conducted an inspection on 6&nbsp;June&nbsp;2013 of
                the riser assessment program in Quebec that demonstrated the
                implementation of this program and no non-compliances were
                identified during the inspection.

              <p>
                TransCanada indicated that only a limited number of excavations
                with the primary purpose of performing a direct examination of
                the integrity of the station piping have been done so far, but
                that some opportunistic excavations (due to maintenance or
                modifications for example) have been used to assess the
                condition of the buried station piping at some locations.
                TransCanada provided records of these opportunistic facility
                piping inspections, which included:

                TransCanada stated that it has assessed the risk of external
                corrosion as being low for its station piping, taking into
                consideration the fact that the station piping is operating at a
                lower stress level than the main line pipe, that there are no
                unresolved CP issues at its stations, and because it has never
                had a rupture and was not aware of any leak on the pipe body at
                any of its stations.
              </p>
              <p>
                As previously described, TransCanada’s station piping was
                managed under the

                  >Integrity Management Process for Pipelines -
                  Revision&nbsp;2</em
                >
                process. Review of Sections&nbsp;7.3 and&nbsp;7.4 of this
                process indicates that the integrity monitoring program was
                focused on the above ground piping and limited to CP monitoring,
                leak surveys and opportunistic excavations for standard
                monitoring of the below ground piping. Review of these sections
                also indicated that only if issues with CP or external corrosion
                were identified would inspection techniques such as ILI, direct
                assessment or leak testing be used. Therefore, a proactive or
                adequate monitoring program was not in place for the integrity
                of the station piping prior to the new Facility Pipe Threat
                Management Program, which was approved by TransCanada management
                for use in December&nbsp;2012, has not yet been fully
                implemented throughout TransCanada’s gas facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified that, at the time of the audit activities,
                TransCanada has not conducted adequate direct assessments,
                hydrotests or ILI programs to assess the potential for external
                corrosion of its below-ground station piping. With the exception
                of the riser assessment program in the Eastern region, where the
                station risers are exposed for approximately 50 cm, there has
                not been a formal system-wide assessment for potential external
                corrosion of its below-ground or air-to-soil interface station
                piping. Where there is no riser program in place, the integrity
                monitoring for the below-ground or air-to-soil interface station
                piping is limited to CP pipe-to-soil potential and rectifier
                monitoring and a limited number of opportunistic excavations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although TransCanada stated that, to its knowledge, it has not
                yet identified any external corrosion issues on its below-ground
                station piping, the methods used by TransCanada are not adequate
                to demonstrate the appropriate integrity management of the
                station piping and TransCanada is therefore determined to be
                non-compliant with the requirements of this audit element and
                with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;3.2.

                pressure vessel inspections are carried out in accordance with
                the Quality Assurance Manual (QAM) for the Integrity Management
                of Pressure Equipment Including Repairs and Alterations
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003722000). This procedure is based on the
                API&nbsp;510 Pressure Vessel Inspection Code, Alberta inspection
                standards and industry practice. The inspection of pressure
                vessels follows the TOP Pressure Vessel External and Internal
                Inspection (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003694710), under the direction
                of TransCanada’s Chief Inspector for pressure equipment.
                Pressure vessel inspections are documented and the vessels are
                certified for continued service by the Chief Inspector. The
                Pressure Vessel Integrity Plan (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003763099) is
                reviewed periodically by Facilities Engineering to review risks
                and to direct future inspection programs. Heating boiler
                inspections are carried out in accordance with Part&nbsp;5 of
                the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations by the
                provincial jurisdictional authority or by an insurance company
                authorized by the provincial jurisdictional authority.
                Occasionally in Alberta (only), heating boiler inspections are
                carried out by the Chief Inspector, as authorized by the
                provincial jurisdictional authority.

                Based on audit interviews and documents reviewed, the Board
                noted that geotechnical hazards, such as susceptible landslide
                locations, are identified in a Phase&nbsp;1 Geo-Hazards
                Assessment, as described in the Weather and Outside Forces (WOF)
                Threat Management Program (TEP-ITM-WOF,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;005767611). As per Section&nbsp;5, Roles,
                Responsibilities and Qualifications of the WOF procedure, higher
                risk sites are further assessed by TransCanada senior
                geotechnical engineers (E4-5 classification and evidenced by
                records requested during the audit and provided by TransCanada).
                Appropriate actions (e.g., regular inspection and monitoring,
                slope remediation) are taken based on the results of the
                assessment. Geotechnical and river crossing monitoring
                activities are supplemented by TransCanada’s Aerial Pipeline
                Patrol program and by field personnel observations.
                TransCanada’s IIT system is used to track issues related to
                geotechnical remediation and monitoring programs for follow-up
                and resolution.

                  potential for ground movement. A subsequent Phase&nbsp;II
                  study was completed in May&nbsp;2000 to assess the site
                  conditions. The findings were documented in a technical
                  memorandum titled &quot;Assessment of Slope Movement
                  Potential, Site Visit Report&quot;. The Phase&nbsp;III

                During the audit, it was observed that TransCanada’s WOF program
                did identify areas of geological sensitivity, but this
                information did not appear to influence the scope and/or
                frequency of the geological hazard patrol program. TransCanada
                responded to this audit observation by stating that
                &quot;TransCanada determines the scope and typical frequency of
                ROW patrol based on class locations, history of the lines, and
                other factors. Additional patrols are initiated in response to
                unforeseen geotechnical and meteorological events. TEP-ITM-WOF
                Section&nbsp;8.4 Step&nbsp;35 specifies that an aerial or ground
                survey shall be performed when investigating significant
                meteorological events; Section&nbsp;8.4 Step&nbsp;27 specifies
                that an aerial or ground survey shall be performed to
                investigate areas where earthquake magnitudes exceed 0.2&nbsp;g
                peak ground acceleration. Identifying geotechnical threats is a
                part of the ROW patrol, but usually not a main factor that
                dictates the frequency of the patrol, because geotechnical
                threats, once identified, are dealt with separately in its own
                systematic way. Once an area of geological sensitivity is
                identified and verified through ground investigation, we install
                monitoring equipment and perform regular ground inspections.
                There are sites of active ground movement (Simonette River
                crossing for instance) where we have inspection and monitoring
                up to three times a year, in addition to regular aerial ROW
                patrol. Our experience so far has demonstrated that the regular
                scheduled aerial patrols supplemented by additional ground
                inspections/monitoring at sensitive areas have been effective in
                identifying WOF related hazards before they become threats to
                the integrity of our pipelines.&quot;

                that require inspection and monitoring programs. During the
                audit interviews, TransCanada indicated that periodic
                inspections are conducted at stream crossing locations of
                concern for adequacy of cover, accumulation of debris, and other
                conditions that may affect the safety or integrity of the
                crossing. Underwater depth of cover surveys are performed at
                selected stream crossing locations based on size of stream bed,
                visibility during aerial patrols, results of previous surveys,
                potential for mechanical damage, and severity of identified
                consequences. Minimum stream crossing cover specifications and
                stream crossing survey procedures are found in the TOP Pipeline
                Underwater Inspections (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003671756).
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit interviews, the Board noted that TransCanada’s
                geological hazards classification summary refers to geotechnical
                threats and erosion threats, but the WOF program does not cover
                soil erosion and/or flooding threats. The Board requested that
                TransCanada address this concern. TransCanada’s response was as
                follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                &quot;The Geological Hazards Classification Summary in the TQM
                Phase&nbsp;I Geo-hazard Assessment reports refers to slope
                stability and erosion as two main geotechnical threats that
                could impact pipelines on the TQM system. They are addressed in
                the
                <em
                  >TEP-ITM-WOF Weather and Outside Forces Management Program</em
                >
                somewhat differently due to nature of the threats with respect
                to integrity. Slope stability impacts pipe integrity in a direct
                way, so actions dealing with slope movement are clearly defined
                in the TEP. Soil erosion itself is not an integrity threat,
                until it leads to pipe exposure. As such, TransCanada does not
                address soil erosion in the TEP-ITM-WOF. Rather the procedures
                in dealing with pipe exposure are outlined and documented in
                Steps&nbsp;40 to&nbsp;49 (page&nbsp;20 to&nbsp;22) of the
                TEP-ITM-WOF.

                The document, TEP-ITM-WOF Weather and Outside Forces Management
                Program contains the following references to flooding:

              <ol>
                <li>
                  The definition of a &quot;weather and outside force integrity
                  event&quot;, (page&nbsp;9), defines floods as among the events
                  that may impact the integrity of the pipeline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Section&nbsp;6.1.5 describes water flow events, including
                  floods that could lead to pipe exposures and therefore
                  increase the potential for mechanical damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Section&nbsp;8.2, step&nbsp;8 instructs the reader to identify
                  areas of exposed pipe or having the potential to become
                  exposed. Flooding is directly mentioned in that step.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Section&nbsp;8.4, steps&nbsp;28 to&nbsp;33 are applied
                  &quot;when investigating significant flooding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Section&nbsp;8.4 Step&nbsp;35 instructs the reader to perform
                  and aerial or ground survey when investigating significant
                  meteorological events.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The potential threat of stream erosion, which could lead to pipe
                exposure, is managed through regular underwater survey in major
                stream crossings. The TEP-ITM-WOF Section&nbsp;8.2, step&nbsp;8
                states &quot;Identify exposed pipe locations and areas of
                potential exposure from underwater surveys. The underwater
                surveys are performed as described in TOP Pipeline Underwater
                Inspections, (EDMS&nbsp;003671756). During the audit, the Board
                reviewed TransCanada’s water crossing monitoring procedures and
                assessed them to be in compliance with the requirements.

                Summary: Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;4.1, Inspection,
                Measurement and Monitoring, requires a company to develop and
                implement surveillance and monitoring programs including
                contract work being performed on behalf of the company. These
                programs are expected to include measures for evaluating the
                management and protection programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents and records reviewed, the audit determined
                that TransCanada has developed and implemented a number of
                effective inspection, measurement and monitoring programs. This
                includes but is not limited to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sediment and water monitoring and mitigation programs to
                  prevent and reduce internal corrosion on the Keystone pipeline
                  system;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Conducting both aerial and ground-based pipeline patrols in
                  accordance with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 requirements with additional
                  patrols as warranted or as directed by the regulator;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Development of monitoring programs to evaluate specific
                  geotechnical hazards in each operating region; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Regular inspection and monitoring of sensitive areas including
                  river crossings and susceptible landslide locations.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Other sections of this sub-element were identified as
                non-complaint with regulatory requirements due to inadequate or
                incomplete program implementation. This included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  TransCanada’s position that ongoing monitoring of all shipped
                  commodities for sour crude on the Keystone pipeline is not
                  required since recent testing confirmed the current non-sour
                  nature of these products;
                </li>
                <li>
                  TransCanada’s inability to produce sufficient evidence proving
                  the adequacy of its ongoing integrity management programs for
                  corrosion on unpiggable sections of the NGTL system; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  background descriptions for the facility pipe inspection
                  program that were too generic and did not provide the level of
                  specificity required for adequate, effective and consistent
                  implementation.

              <p>
                During interviews and in documents submitted, TransCanada
                indicated that it has an Incident Management System (InMS),
                which is a set of management tools and processes used to
                investigate incidents or any non-compliance. Within the InMS,
                TransCanada has the Incident and Issue Management Program
                (InMP), which utilizes the following tools:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An Incident and Issue Tracking (IIT) system, which is an
                  electronic database tool used to report and track the
                  investigation of an incident, a near-hit or an identified
                  non-compliance. The criteria for incidents, near-hits and
                  non-compliances are listed on the company’s IIT incident
                  summary sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Classification Guide, which is a document defining the
                  incident and issue event types reportable in the IIT system.
                  These are a detailed breakdown of the event types into four
                  levels of severity (Minor, Serious, Major and Critical).

                TransCanada’s Incident Management System, with its criteria for
                incident classification and investigation were assessed to be in
                compliance with the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,

              <p>
                TransCanada provided information on the six main steps in its
                InMP, as follows:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Response: All TransCanada employees and its contractors are
                  expected to participate in the InMP. They are responsible for
                  recognizing that an incident or issue has occurred and for
                  alerting the appropriate personnel in the event of an incident
                  occurrence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notification: Once the response has taken place, an employee
                  is to enter the incident into the IIT system, which is
                  responsible for the notification of applicable personnel and
                  regulatory agencies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Investigation: All incidents and issues are to be reviewed.
                  The level of rigor of investigation of each incident is
                  dependent on the severity of the incident. Once investigation
                  findings have been determined, appropriate corrective and
                  preventive actions are to be identified and implemented to
                  minimize or avoid future incidents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Documentation and Implementation: Documented recommendations
                  are updated into IIT and/or incorporated into TransCanada’s
                  Integrity Management Programs (IMPs), as appropriate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Follow-up: Once the recommendations have been implemented,
                  follow-up is to take place to ensure the recommendations were
                  successful in addressing the incident or issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sharing of Learnings: The final step of the InMP is to share
                  the learnings with TransCanada’s employees, contractors and
                  external parties, with the goal of preventing a future
                  undesirable consequence from occurring.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;3.1, Safety and Loss Management

                  management system, and the mechanisms for taking corrective
                  and preventive measures in the event of
                  nonconformance&quot;</em
                >. In addition, CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;10.3.6, Pipeline

                  incidents due to similar causes shall be identified and
                  implemented&quot;</em
                >. TransCanada’s procedures for incident management were
                assessed to be in compliance with the requirements, but as
                discussed under the topic of Incident Reporting, TransCanada’s
                incident reports lack detail with respect to preventive actions,
                follow-up and sharing of learnings. TransCanada has committed to
                working with the Board to improve the level of detail in its
                DIRs.

              <p>
                During the course of this audit and in response to an Audit
                Information Request, TransCanada provided evidence of its
                analysis of six incident types:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>overpressure of pipelines and/or facilities piping;</li>
                <li>pump station leaks;</li>
                <li>other station releases;</li>
                <li>pipe body leaks and pipe body ruptures; and</li>
                <li>uninterruptable power supply (UPS) battery incidents.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The purpose of the interviews and document reviews relating to
                these incident types was to assess whether TransCanada had
                effectively implemented its IMS processes and procedures to
                identify the incident root cause(s), implement adequate and
                effective corrective and preventive action(s), and adequately
                and effectively followed its InMP processes and procedures for
                follow-up and sharing of learnings from the incidents,
                particularly for incidents related to TransCanada’s IMPs. As
                discussed under the topic of Incident Reporting, TransCanada’s
                incident reports lack detail with respect to preventive actions,
                follow-up and sharing of learnings. TransCanada has committed to
                working with the Board to improve the level of detail in its
                DIRs.

              <p>
                TransCanada also submitted documents (Integrity Threat
                Management Scorecards) to demonstrate that it had compiled and
                analyzed key performance indicator (KPI) and incident data. The
                Scorecards submitted and reviewed were:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Internal Corrosion;</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, TransCanada submitted the document &quot;Gas
                Release-Leak (Canada) 2007-2012 Chart Q4r1.xls&quot; that
                compiled the gas releases reportable to the Board from&nbsp;2007
                to&nbsp;2012. TransCanada presented these figures as evidence of
                its process to analyze and trend incidents and their root
                causes. The document submitted contained histogram
                representations of the trends and/or causal factors relating to
                the gas releases as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Figure&nbsp;1: Gas Leak and Release Trends;</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s Scorecards contained information on the individual
                threat management programs, including: goals and objectives;
                failure statistics (incident rates x 10&sup3; per&nbsp;km.yr)
                due to each threat; in-service leaks and ruptures; and
                histograms and pie charts of threat related data. The Scorecards
                were assessed to be in compliance with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;10.3.6, Pipeline system incident investigations.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s4_2_3_5">Non-Compliance Process</h5>
              <p>
                TransCanada stated that it has a systematic approach to
                addressing non-compliances. Non-compliances at the IMP level,
                and non-compliances with regulations and codes, are addressed
                and tracked through its IIT system. Corrective actions,
                including completion dates and follow-up, are assigned to
                specific individuals in the IIT system. The status of IIT
                incidents and issues, and action items, are reviewed by
                management monthly. In addition to day-to-day monitoring,
                non-conformances are identified through the following: audit
                findings (external and internal); process reviews, including
                TransCanada’s Operating Procedures (TOPs); and incident
                investigations (failures, near-hits).
              </p>
              <h6 id="s4_2_3_5_1"><em>Pipelines (Oil and Gas)</em></h6>
              <p>
                For its pipeline systems (gas and liquids), TransCanada stated
                that corrective and preventive actions identified through
                internal audit findings are consolidated in an action log. The
                audit log lists identified actions to address the deficiencies,
                responsible individuals, completion dates and status. The status
                of corrective or preventative actions is included in the
                CDN-LIQ-IMP<em> Annual Review and Improvement Report</em>.
                Process Reviews of procedures are conducted annually, as
                described in the
                <em>Pipe Integrity Process Review Procedure</em>.
              </p>
              <h6 id="s4_2_3_5_2"><em>Facilities</em></h6>
              <p>
                For its facilities, TransCanada stated that corrective actions
                are also identified, investigated, evaluated and prioritized,
                based on the engineering discipline and equipment type, using
                other systems such as the TransCanada Operating Procedures
                (TOPs), Avantis (TransCanada’s work management system) and
                health monitoring motor trending. Other tools, such as a
                Decision Support System (DSS), health monitoring, and pressure
                vessel and tank investigations, are used to complete trending
                analyses to determine if further actions are required for
                systemic issues and if these actions need to be tracked in a
                corrective log with monthly review by all stakeholders. Actions
                are then implemented in the General Plan Maintenance Capital
                (GPMC) program or the Preventive Maintenance (PM) program, which
                determines whether the risk is tolerated, terminated or
                transferred.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada stated that it ensures that corrective actions are
                implemented and followed up as part of the management review
                process. Management review includes monitoring the status of
                corrective and preventive actions in IIT monthly, and reviewing
                program performance measures to determine the effectiveness of
                the overall program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Assessment of TransCanada’s InMS and InMP determined that within
                its internal processes and procedures, TransCanada has
                demonstrated compliance with the requirements of this audit
                element for its facilities. As discussed in the following text,
                TransCanada’s incident reporting, in the form of Detailed
                Incident Reports (DIRs) submitted to the Board, lacks detail
                with respect to preventive actions, follow-up and sharing of
                learnings.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s4_2_3_6">Incident Reporting</h5>
              <p>
                In a meeting held&nbsp;7 March&nbsp;2013 to discuss
                TransCanada’s DIRs, it was communicated to TransCanada that: the
                DIR corrective actions were assessed to be generally adequate;
                preventive actions tended to address local issues only; and
                incident follow-up and sharing of learnings were generally
                inadequate. TransCanada stated that the timeframe of submitting
                its DIRs to the Board and its internal incident investigation
                processes accounted for the discrepancies in the level of
                detail. That is, its DIRs are written and submitted more
                immediately following an incident, whereas its internal incident
                processes are generally conducted in detail some months later.
                To address the issue, TransCanada committed to working with the
                Board to improve the level of detail in its DIRs, and both the
                Board and TransCanada have committed to improving their
                communications with respect to TransCanada meeting the Board’s
                expectations for incidents investigation and reporting.
              </p>
              <h5 id="s4_2_3_7">Reporting of Non-Compliances</h5>
              <p>
                TransCanada was asked to provide its policies and procedures for
                the internal reporting of non-compliances. TransCanada stated
                that there are many available outlets for employees to bring
                concerns forward to TransCanada’s management. These included the
                Incident and Issue Tracking (IIT) system; Ethics Help line;
                informal and formal reports to technical managers,
                non-conformance reports (NCRs); and the TransCanada Code of
                Business Ethics policy and procedures. TransCanada stated that
                employees are trained on these procedures during the onboarding
                process and through the annual employee Code of Business Ethics
                policy training and certification.  TransCanada’s internal Human
                Resources website provides employees with a list of the
                Compliance Coordinators for different areas of the company and a
                link to this document was, and continues to be, accessible to
                employees in the &quot;Raise the Concern&quot; section of the
                website. TransCanada stated that its management encourages open
                and honest discussion of all areas of concern and promotes an
                environment where safety is the paramount goal. TransCanada
                provided the following documentation to support its internal
                reporting of non-compliances:
              </p>
              <ul>

              <h4 id="s4_2_4">Summary: Corrective and Preventive Actions</h4>
              <p>
                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;4.2, Corrective and
                Preventive Actions, requires a company to have a process to
                investigate incidents or any non-compliance that may occur,
                including a process to mitigate any potential or actual impacts
                arising from the non-compliances. The company is also required
                to develop procedures to analyze incident data in order to
                identify deficiencies and opportunities for proactive
                improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the course of this audit, TransCanada provided evidence
                of its analysis of possible incident types. The company also
                demonstrated it had compiled and analyzed key performance
                indicator data in order to assess trends and establish root
                causes of incidents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that TransCanada’s internal non-compliance and
                incident reporting processes were adequate but could be more
                detailed in the areas of preventative action and information
                sharing across the company. TransCanada has committed to
                improving the level of detail in these items.

              <p>
                During interviews and in documents submitted, TransCanada stated
                that the mandate of TransCanada’s internal audit department
                (Internal Audit) is to act as an independent assessor, reporting
                on the company’s system of internal controls, governance and
                risk management processes. Internal Audit reports functionally
                to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and
                administratively to the Chief Compliance Officer. Internal Audit
                is authorized to perform internal audits, including those
                involving Integrity Management Programs (IMPs). For
                TransCanada’s IMPs, Internal Audit follows a maximum interval
                between audits of three years.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following IMP documents state the requirements of
                TransCanada’s internal audit program:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gas Pipeline IMP, Section&nbsp;4.10;</li>
                <li>Liquid Pipeline IMP, Section&nbsp;11.3.5; and</li>
                <li>Plant IMP, Section&nbsp;2.5.2.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On a one to three-year basis, all procedural documents are
                reviewed for effectiveness by document owners and other
                shareholders. With respect to the IMPs, the engineering
                procedures are reviewed annually following the Pipe Integrity
                Process Review Procedure (TEP-INT-PR,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006522487). The effectiveness of the process
                and management system elements within each document is reviewed
                to identify non-compliances/non-conformances and/or areas
                requiring improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Internal audits are conducted by TransCanada personnel that are
                independent of the areas to be audited, consistent with
                Annex&nbsp;N &quot;Guidelines for pipeline system integrity
                management programs&quot; of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, specifically
                Clause&nbsp;N.15.4(d). In this respect, IMP audits are completed
                by the Quality Management and Engineering Standards group or a
                third-party auditor. The Quality Manager is responsible for
                ensuring that employees are competent to complete internal
                office audits through documented skills, certifications,
                training or education. As a minimum, the Lead Auditor is
                qualified to the ISO Internal Auditor training,
                CSA&nbsp;Internal Auditor training or equivalent. The competency
                of third-party auditors is managed through the vendor
                qualification process, which includes requirements for
                documentation addressing the third-party auditor training and
                certification.

                On a quarterly basis, TransCanada conducts field-based Targeted
                Compliance Audits that are performed at multiple locations
                within the Canadian Pipeline Operations Regions. The results are
                consolidated in a single report, which identifies systemic
                issues related to the topic assessed during the audit.
                Field-based audits are conducted by Canadian Pipeline Operations
                Compliance (CPO Compliance) team members comprised of a Senior
                Compliance Specialist and three Field Compliance Specialists.
                All team members attend internal training courses and receive
                certification from a training course conducted by an external
                third party. It is the responsibility of the CPO Compliance
                Manager to ensure employees are competent to complete
                field-based audits through documented skills, certifications,
                training or education. The process for completing audits is
                documented in TransCanada Operating Procedure (TOP) Compliance
                Assurance Program (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;005364423) and the
                associated TOP Targeted Audit (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006281982).

                The Quality Management and Engineering Standards internal audit
                processes and procedures requires the person accountable for the
                program that has been audited to resolve all findings. Audit
                findings are tracked in action logs or the Incident and Issue
                Tracking (IITs) database. Issues related to each audit are
                identified, and corrective and preventive actions,
                accountabilities, and timelines are recommended by the CPO
                Compliance audit team. Site-specific findings that are not
                considered to be systemic in nature are provided to the specific
                area manager to address. The finalized audit report is provided
                to the Vice President, Canadian Pipeline Operations, the
                regional leadership teams (Directors and Managers) and leaders
                of other departments who have been assigned specific actions to
                address identified deficiencies, and on whom the audit may have
                an impact. The Senior Compliance Specialist is responsible for
                monitoring the progress of audit resolutions and for escalating
                issues when deemed necessary. The status of completion of the
                actions is also tracked in the monthly CPO Compliance Scorecard,
                which is issued to and reviewed by the Vice President, Canadian
                Pipeline Operations, and the Directors.

                <em>1. Independent Third Party Non-Destructive Examination</em>
              </h6>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s internal audit concluded that there had been
                instances where TransCanada did not ensure that qualified, third
                party non-destructive examination (NDE) vendors were hired under
                the direct supervision of TransCanada (and not by the pipeline,
                facility or fabrication contractor), resulting in a lack of
                independence. This was a non-compliance with the OPR-99,
                section&nbsp;54(1), which states:
                <em
                  >&quot;When a company constructs a pipeline, the company or an
                  agent independent of any construction contractor retained by
                  the company shall inspect the construction to ensure that it
                  meets the requirements of these Regulations and complies with
                  the terms and conditions of any certificate or order issued by
                  the Board.&quot;</em
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada’s internal audit noted that a process was being
                implemented to ensure independent NDE inspections. During the
                NEB audit interviews, TransCanada confirmed that new processes
                were in place to ensure that NDE vendors were hired by
                TransCanada directly. NEB auditors requested that TransCanada
                demonstrate that it had a plan in place to examine past NDE
                results in order to validate whether these non-independent
                inspections would constitute a future integrity hazard.
                TransCanada responded as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                <em
                  >&quot;For fabrication of piping assemblies between
                  May&nbsp;2004 and August&nbsp;2011, TransCanada used
                  fabrication shops with certified Quality Management Systems.
                  The fabrication facilities were responsible for hiring
                  qualified third party NDE contractors to complete the
                  inspections. TransCanada hired a third party inspector to
                  oversee the work produced by the fabrication shop and the NDE
                  contractor. The TransCanada inspector was responsible for
                  ensuring the fabrication shops met the specification and
                  procedure requirements for materials, welding, non-destructive
                  examination, pressure testing and coating. The inspector was
                  responsible for checking the radiographic film to ensure the
                  level of quality was met and that all welds were inspected.
                  The fabrication of piping assemblies was completed in
                  accordance with the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662 and the
                  piping assemblies were completed using TransCanada’s welding
                  specification (TEP-NDT-ADT, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;003797402),
                  which requires 100% NDE of welds. The TransCanada
                  specifications for NDE required that all radiographic film
                  interpretation be completed by a Canadian Government Standards
                  Board (CGSB) Level II technician. TransCanada stated that the
                  fabricated assemblies in question were all subjected to a high
                  pressure hydrostatic test before going into service and are
                  not considered an integrity hazard.&quot;</em
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada completed a review of the projects on which
                fabrication of piping assemblies was completed for the time
                frame of&nbsp;2004 to&nbsp;2011 and determined that there are
                approximately 50 meter stations and 7 pipeline projects where
                fabricated pipeline assemblies were installed under NEB
                jurisdiction without independent third party NDE. To address the
                issue, TransCanada proposed an audit of the projects using its
                NDE procedure TEP-NDT-ADT, Clauses&nbsp;7.2.2 to&nbsp;7.2.4
                (inclusive), which specifies a 15% progressive audit of the
                radiographs involved. The Board reviewed TransCanada’s proposed
                audit criteria to determine whether it would provide adequate
                examination of the welds that had occurred in the past projects.
                The Board determined that TransCanada’s proposed audit procedure
                (15% of the welds) did not meet the requirements of the OPR-99,
                section&nbsp;17.<sup><a href="#ftn5back" id="ftn5">[5]</a></sup>
                TransCanada subsequently revised its audit criteria to include
                100% of the subject welds and is therefore now in compliance
                with the OPR-99, section&nbsp;17 requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure that TransCanada will provide qualified, third party
                non-destructive examination (NDE) contractors that are hired
                under the direct supervision of TransCanada, and not by the
                pipeline, facility or fabrication contractor, TransCanada stated
                that it has developed new Master Service Agreement (MSA)
                contracts with its approved NDE contractors, under which
                TransCanada is solely responsible for hiring the NDE personnel.
                TransCanada stated that it had also developed revised Work
                Authorization contract documents for work not covered by the
                MSAs, which specifically state that the NDE contractors will be
                hired directly by TransCanada. As a result of its internal
                audit, TransCanada also developed a procedure
                (TEP-NDE-INSP-SHOP, Fabrication Shop Non-Destructive Examination
                Inspection Procedure, EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;006684544) outlining
                the requirements for conducting NDE in fabrication shops. This
                procedure had an effective date of October&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2011
                and the procedure stated under Clause&nbsp;1 that:
                <em
                  >&quot;TransCanada will hire: (1) A Fabricator to construct
                  assemblies; (2) An NDE contractor to conduct non-destructive
                  examinations of the welds; and (3) A Fabrication Inspector to
                  inspect the results prepared by the NDE contractor.&quot;</em
                >
              </p>

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that had been instances where TransCanada did
                not ensure that qualified, third party non-destructive
                examination (NDE) vendors were hired under its direct
                supervision. Therefore, TransCanada had been non-compliant with
                the OPR-99, section&nbsp;54(1). However, the Board also
                concluded that the measures taken by TransCanada to ensure
                independent third-party NDE inspections, as well as
                TransCanada’s commitment to undertake an audit of 100% of the
                previously affected welds, adequately addresses the issue of
                independent third-party NDE.

                TransCanada’s internal audit concluded that, in the past,
                TransCanada was non-compliant with CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;7.10.2 (Visual Inspection), and specifically
                sub-clause&nbsp;7.10.2.1, which states that:

                  non-destructive inspection, in accordance with documented
                  procedures approved by the company. Such procedures shall
                  include requirements for extent and frequency of visual
                  inspection, personnel qualification and visual acuity, maximum
                  viewing distance and angle, lighting conditions, evaluation
                  tools, and reporting.&quot;</em

              <p>
                TransCanada’s internal audit noted that TransCanada’s management
                agreed to follow up on this issue. TransCanada’s Materials
                Engineering met with Construction Services management, welders
                and foremen to discuss the issue of inspection/audit procedures
                for maintenance welding to ensure compliance with the
                requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;7.10.2.1.
                TransCanada stated that its personnel completed a full review of
                the welding and NDE specifications and procedures applicable to
                their responsibilities. A qualified technical specialist
                provided welder training and witnessed the qualification test
                welds. In addition, a revised method for tracking welder
                qualifications was implemented. TransCanada’s Construction
                Services department created and filled the position of a
                Construction Services Manager responsible for Equipment, Quality
                Assurance/Quality Control, Welding and Fabrication. The
                Materials Engineering Department met with the Construction
                Services Manager to discuss the actions that had been
                implemented up to the date of the internal audit, as well as the
                implementation of further recommendations on training and the
                overall inspection requirements with respect to welder
                supervision and inspection.

                As a result of the NEB audit interviews, TransCanada provided
                its engineering procedure, TEP-NDT-VT Visual Examination
                (EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;007381161) and examples of welder inspection

                TransCanada’s internal audit concluded that a variance to the
                American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Section&nbsp;V
                - Non-destructive Examination had occurred in that, in one
                instance, the NDE of a pressure vessel was known to be
                insufficient due to the NDE inspector being unable to inspect
                the full weld beneath a plate attached to a nozzle. The NDE
                inspection report did not meet code as it incorrectly indicated
                full inspection had occurred. Had the NDE inspection report
                indicated that the complete weld inspection had not occurred due
                to restricted access, the report would have met the requirements

                Compressor Station project. This project was taken out of
                service by TransCanada’s Engineering Department in
                September&nbsp;2011. A complete review of the design drawings,
                fabrication welding procedures and NDE inspection procedures was
                completed by TransCanada through September, October and
                November&nbsp;2011. An internal report was competed on this
                review and, in particular, the questions raised regarding the
                NDE for the nozzle weld. The review determined the NDE of the
                small diameter nozzles was completed, but the NDE technician
                referenced the incorrect procedure and did not indicate the
                restricted inspection area in the report. This was addressed
                with the third party NDE company and resolved. The pressure
                vessel was released for installation in November&nbsp;2011 and
                the pressure vessel was included in the field pressure testing
                program for the station piping at the Gold Creek Compressor
                Station. The report also recommended changes to the process for
                procurement and third party inspection of pressure vessels.
                TransCanada’s Materials Engineering department has revised the
                third party surveillance checklist used for pressure vessels and
                has worked directly with the third party inspection company to
                provide the third party inspectors with training on the
                specification requirements and expectations on reporting.

                Clause&nbsp;7.8, Arc and Gas welding - Qualification of Welders,
                due to welding being performed by an unqualified welder.
                TransCanada stated that the lack of welder qualification was
                discovered by a TransCanada inspection and documents
                coordinator, who ordered corrective action to be taken, which
                consisted of removal of the welds in question. TransCanada
                required that all of the welds in question be redone by a

                was done under TransCanada’s permit to practice and by
                professional engineers registered in Alberta. To ensure
                TransCanada engineers and technologists were clear in their
                roles and responsibilities, TransCanada management implemented a
                review of the Engineering requirements in the Practice of
                Engineering specification (TES-ENG-POE, TransCanada Practice of
                Engineering (POE) EMDS # 003672108, revised in Nov.&nbsp;2011).
                The Practice of Engineering specification includes guidance on
                the requirements for both internal TransCanada and third party
                engineering (Sections&nbsp;5.1 and&nbsp;5.2 respectively).

              <p>
                In&nbsp;2012, TransCanada management also implemented mandatory
                training on TransCanada’s Practice of Engineering and
                TransCanada’s Professional Engineering Management Plan for
                engineers and technologists within the company. This training is
                currently being added into the TransCanada Learning Management
                System (LMS) as a requirement for Engineers to take every 3
                years. TransCanada’s Practice of Engineering outlines
                authentication requirements for engineering documents produced
                by or for TransCanada. TransCanada’s Professional Engineering
                Management Plan outlines principle information regarding the
                management of engineering within TransCanada. TransCanada
                procedures related to projects have design reviews by technical
                and engineering resources that are designed to occur at the 30%,
                60% and 90% design stages. When the work is completed by
                external engineering companies, the final designs are

                TransCanada’s internal audit investigated an allegation that
                using back-beveled transition welds is prone to higher incidence
                of failure than using counter-bore and taper welds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The internal audit concluded that the failure incident reference
                was made to historical welding practices that were acceptable at
                that time. TransCanada stated that the use of taper (back
                beveling) is a common practice within the pipeline industry.
                Clause&nbsp;7, Joining, of CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, provides guidance
                on the recommended designs of unequal wall thickness weld
                joints. Figure&nbsp;7.1,

                internal, and unequal external diameters.
              </p>
              <p>
                The joining requirements in CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 were compared to
                TransCanada’s specification for transitioning of weld joints
                with unequal wall thickness pipe (TEP-MECH-TRAN, Selection of
                Transition Pieces and Joining Methods,
                EDMS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;000006256). This internal specification
                provides guidance on determining when to use the back bevel
                design or the counter-bored and taper design. TransCanada
                currently implements this specification when the wall thickness
                difference of two adjoining pieces of pipeline is greater than
                1.0&nbsp;mm (TEP-MECH-TRAN, Figure&nbsp;2(a) through
                Figure&nbsp;2(d) of Section&nbsp;4.0). TransCanada’s joining
                specification meets the requirements of Clause&nbsp;7 of
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11. TransCanada also manages the risk of weld
                joint cracking through control of welding parameters such as
                preheat, welding heat input and pipe movement during welding
                and, in addition, Section&nbsp;2.0.3 of the TransCanada
                specification states that
                <em
                  >&quot;the transition weld shall not be located in the
                  immediate region of high bending moments (such as may be
                  generated by filed overbends, sidebends or sagbends). The
                  transition weld shall be located at a minimum distance of 3D
                  from the end of the bend to the transition. Unless it can be
                  demonstrated that a lesser distance will not adversely affect

                TransCanada’s internal audit investigated an allegation that the
                use of Automatic Ultrasonic Testing (AUT) is more sensitive in
                picking up defects than radiographic inspection. TransCanada’s
                internal audit stated that CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 and the OPR-99 allow
                for the use of radiography or ultrasonic methods to examine
                girth welds. TransCanada uses either AUT or radiography (RT) for
                the non-destructive examination of butt welds on pipeline
                construction. Both of these non-destructive techniques have been
                used in pipeline construction for many years and the
                requirements for their use are included in CSA&nbsp;Z662-11,
                Clause&nbsp;7.10.4 Non-destructive inspection. TransCanada uses
                radiography for butt welds on Nominal Pipe Size
                (NPS)&nbsp;2&quot; to NPS&nbsp;48&quot; pipe to pipe joints or
                pipe to component joints. The AUT method is applied to
                NPS&nbsp;20&quot; to NPS&nbsp;48&quot; pipe to pipe mainline and
                tie-in welds on pipelines projects where the wall thickness is
                6.4&nbsp;mm and greater. The minimum diameter limit is applied
                to the projects due to the wall thicknesses being less than
                6.4&nbsp;mm and the inspection system’s physical size as it sits
                on the pipe. TransCanada’s specification used for automatic
                ultrasonic inspection is TES-NDT-UT1, Mechanized Ultrasonic
                Examination of Pipeline Girth Welds

              <p>
                The Board concluded that TransCanada is in compliance with the
                requirements of the OPR-99, section&nbsp;55(1)(<em>b</em>) and
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, Clause&nbsp;3.1.2(h)(iii). The Board also
                concluded that TransCanada has the processes and procedures in
                place to address the requirements of a formal audit and
                inspection program.

              <p>
                The Management System Audit Element&nbsp;4.4, Internal Audit,
                requires a company to develop and implement a documented process
                for auditing its management and protection programs and
                procedures. The audit process is expected to include and manage
                training and competency requirements for staff carrying out the
                audits and be conducted on a regular basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Internal audits of TransCanada’s IMPs are conducted by personnel
                that are independent of the areas to be audited or by a
                contracted third party. Quarterly field-based compliance audits
                are conducted at multiple locations across Canada. All audit
                findings are tracked and are required to be resolved. Findings
                are also categorized as either site-specific or systemic and
                responsibility for these is assigned accordingly. The progress
                of resolving audit findings is monitored and escalated where
                necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                With regards to the internal audit of TransCanada’s
                investigation stemming for concerns raised by a complainant, the
                Board finds the company’s internal audit procedures effectively
                identified and assigned resolution of any regulatory
                non-compliances.

                At the beginning of each year, the SGC sets direction through
                goals and objectives, along with overall KPIs for the IMPs.
                These common goals and objectives cascade down through the
                organization from the SGC to the individual employee. At each
                successive level of the organization, more specific goals,
                objectives and KPIs are monitored and reviewed to evaluate
                TransCanada’s various programs, including the IMPs, for
                continued suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. At the SGC
                level, monthly management review meetings are held to discuss
                the KPI areas of asset reliability, safety, compliance, risk and
                cost. Regular updates through the chain of command are provided
                though weekly reporting and a monthly review of all outstanding
                incidents and issues.

                Responsibility for review and revision of the IMPs extends from

                The IMPs and supporting documentation are revised on a regular
                basis to capture any significant improvement opportunities.
                Modification to the IMPs and their associated supporting
                procedures and processes is typically driven by lessons learned,

                and Manager level, more detailed KPIs are tracked for the IMP
                and associated procedures as part of the IMPs. During the audit,
                TransCanada provided documentation (TransCanada KPIs -
                Performance Measures, December&nbsp;2012) on its IMP related
                KPIs. In general, in the 500+ KPIs provided, there were numerous
                listings of what are considered to be pipeline attributes rather
                than KPIs. For example, pipeline system length, outer diameter,
                wall thickness, material grade, design class, coating type and
                pipe manufacturer. These are simply fixed attributes of the
                pipeline system and provide no useful information for tracking
                performance. Additionally, of the extensive list of KPIs
                provided, only a few have provided direct input into the
                individual threat management scorecards.

                  February&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2010) as an example of its IMP review
                  report. Essentially, the 16&nbsp;page document, of which
                  6&nbsp;pages contained the actual review, was a high level
                  process review rather than a zero-based compliance and
                  effectiveness review of TransCanada’s IMPs. Within the

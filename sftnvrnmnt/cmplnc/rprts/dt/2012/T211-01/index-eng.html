              <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
              <p>
                The safety of Canadians and protection of the environment is
                paramount for the National Energy Board (Board or NEB) when
                considering the performance of its regulated companies. The NEB
                requires regulated companies to anticipate, prevent, mitigate
                and manage any hazards and risks associated with their
                operations. The Board holds these companies accountable for
                safety and environmental outcomes in the public interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                The NEB uses a risk-informed approach to identifying which
                regulated companies, facilities and activities require
                regulatory oversight, and which compliance tool is appropriate.
                Management Systems audits are an effective tool to proactively
                detect and correct a company’s non-compliances before these
                non-compliances have any opportunity to grow and potentially
                impact public safety or environmental protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report documents the Board’s focused audit of TransCanada’s
                Integrity Management Programs (IMPs) as they apply to its
                NEB-regulated pipeline facilities. The Board had previously
                scheduled an audit of TransCanada’s Integrity Management
                Programs to start in the second quarter of&nbsp;2013. As a
                result of allegations of regulatory non-compliance brought to
                the Board by a then employee of TransCanada (complainant), the
                Board advanced the timing of its audit and integrated an
                assessment of the allegations within the scope and technical
                protocols developed for the audit. The Integrity Management
                Program audit was conducted between November&nbsp;2012 and
                August&nbsp;2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of this audit, the Board conducted a detailed
                assessment of NEB management system requirements as they relate
                to TransCanada’s integrity management programs. TransCanada was
                required to demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of its
                IMPs as well as its compliance with NEB requirements through
                interviews with company personnel, and the provision of adequate
                supporting documentation and records.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies Management System elements. These elements are
                further broken down into sub-elements. Each sub-element reflects
                a number of regulatory requirements. The NEB requires companies
                to be fully compliant with one hundred percent of the regulatory
                requirements of a sub-element being assessed. If a company’s
                program is found to be deficient with respect to any regulatory
                requirement, the entire sub-element will be found Non-Compliant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board is of the view that the processes presently used by
                TransCanada have identified the majority, and most significant,
                of its hazards and risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board finds TransCanada to be compliant in five sub-elements
                of the audit, those being Organizational Structure, Roles and
                Responsibilities; Training, Competence and Evaluation;
                Operational Control-Normal Operations; Corrective and Preventive
                Actions; and Internal Audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board  finds TransCanada to be non-compliant in four
                sub-elements of the audit, those being Hazard Identification,
                Risk Assessment and Control;  Operational Control-Upset or
                Abnormal Operating Conditions; Inspection, Measurement and
                Monitoring; and Management Review.
              </p>
              <p>
                With regards to concerns presented to the Board by the
                complainant, the audit has confirmed that in response to these
                allegations, TransCanada has developed and implemented a program
                of actions with the goal of correcting and preventing similar
                occurrences. The Board notes that a number of the allegations of
                regulatory non-compliance were identified and addressed by
                TransCanada only after the complainant’s allegations were made
                and were not proactively identified by the company’s management
                system. Details of the Board’s assessment for each complainant
                allegation are contained in Element&nbsp;4.4, Internal Audit, in
                <a

                of this Final Audit Report.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will make the Final Audit Report public and will post
                it to the Board’s external website. TransCanada will be required
                to submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to address the
                Non-Compliant findings identified through this audit, for
                approval, within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being
                issued by the Board. TransCanada’s CAP will also be made public.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will continue to monitor and assess all of
                TransCanada’s corrective actions until they are fully
                implemented. The Board will also continue to monitor the overall
                implementation and effectiveness of TransCanada’s IMPs and
                management system through targeted compliance verification
                activities as a part of its on-going regulatory mandate.

              <h2 id="s2">2.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
              <p>
                The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security,
                environmental protection, and efficient energy infrastructure
                and markets in the Canadian public interest within the mandate
                set by Parliament in the regulation of pipelines, energy
                development and trade.
              </p>
              <p>
                The NEB takes a proactive approach to management of hazards and
                risks. The NEB’s compliance verification activities allow it to
                identify potential issues with regulated companies and, if
                necessary, address them with appropriate enforcement measures.
                Actions include conducting compliance verification activities
                such as inspections, compliance meetings, emergency exercises,
                investigations, and audits such as this one.
              </p>
              <p>
                The NEB requires that each company be able to demonstrate the
                adequacy and implementation of the methods they have selected
                and employed in ordered to proactively identify and manage
                hazards and risks to achieve compliance. To evaluate compliance,
                the NEB undertakes audits of its regulated companies. Following
                the audits, companies are required to submit and implement a
                Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to address and mitigate
                non-compliances identified. The results of the audits are
                considered as a part of the NEB’s risk-informed life cycle
                approach to compliance assurance.
              </p>
              <p>
                A risk-informed approach enables the NEB to further assess and
                understand risks to public or worker safety and the environment
                as a result of pipeline operations. It also allows for public
                resources to be utilized in the most productive and responsible
                way possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit was conducted following its Audit Protocol,
                which identifies Management System elements. These elements are
                further broken down into sub-elements. Each sub-element reflects
                a number of regulatory requirements. The NEB requires companies
                to be fully compliant with one hundred percent of the regulatory
                requirements of a sub-element being assessed. If a company’s
                program is found to be deficient with respect to any regulatory
                requirement, the entire sub-element will be found Non-Compliant.

              <p>
                Since November of&nbsp;2012, NEB auditors and inspectors have
                visited field facilities and TransCanada’s head office auditing
                the adequacy and effectiveness of TransCanada`s integrity
                management programs in order to assess its compliance with the
                <em>National Energy Board Act</em
                ><sup><a href="#ftn1back" id="ftn1">[1]</a></sup>
                (NEB&nbsp;Act), other regulations and industry standards such as
                the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). The targeted audit was
                thorough and included all of TransCanada’s NEB-regulated
                subsidiaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit constituted a focused assessment of TransCanada’s
                IMPs as they apply to its NEB-regulated pipeline facilities. The
                audit scope addressed the following management system
                sub-elements as they relate to TransCanada’s IMPs:

              <p>
                On 1&nbsp;May&nbsp;2012, the Board received a submission from a
                complainant outlining allegations of regulatory non-compliance
                against TransCanada. The Board initiated actions to investigate
                and confirm there were no immediate threats to public safety or
                the environment stemming from these allegations. In light of the
                concerns being brought forward, the Board advanced the timing of
                a TransCanada audit previously scheduled to begin in the
                2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;2013 and integrated an
                assessment of the allegations within the scope and technical
                protocol developed for that audit.

              <p>
                The scope of the audit included an assessment of whether
                TransCanada was fulfilling the requirements set out in:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>the NEB Act;</li>

                <li>
                  CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em>; and
                </li>
                <li>TransCanada’s policies, practices and procedures.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                More specifically, the audit examined nine sub-elements of the
                NEB management system requirements as they relate to
                TransCanada’s integrity management programs. These sub-elements
                were selected using the Board’s risk-informed approach to focus
                the scope of the audit on areas that have previously been shown
                to have the highest rates of non-compliance among NEB-regulated
                companies and to expedite and focus the assessment of the IMP
                technical programs in light of the allegations.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to assess compliance with the sub-elements, TransCanada
                was required to demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of
                its IMPs as well as its compliance with the requirements listed
                above through interviews with company personnel and the
                provision of adequate supporting documentation and records.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted, the audit protocol was modified to specifically
                evaluate the allegations of regulatory non-compliance brought to
                the Board by the complainant. This included, but was not limited
                to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  confirmation that TransCanada’s practices around welding
                  inspections and non-destructive  examination meet NEB
                  requirements to be performed by a certified, third party
                  reporting directly to TransCanada, independent of the
                  contractors performing the work;

                </li>
                <li>
                  evaluation of the specific remediation measures that have been

              <p>
                On 8&nbsp;November&nbsp;2012, an opening meeting was conducted
                in Calgary, Alberta with representatives from TransCanada to
                discuss the Board’s audit objectives, scope and the process, and
                to develop a schedule for conducting the staff interviews and
                site verifications. The interviews at TransCanada’s head office
                and field verifications were carried out between
                November&nbsp;2012 and July&nbsp;2013. At the end of each day,
                daily summaries with action items were provided to TransCanada.
                On 27&nbsp;August&nbsp;2013, an Audit close-out meeting was
                conducted at the NEB office, where the results of the audit,
                including an outline of the draft audit non-compliances, were
                reviewed with TransCanada.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since that time, the Board has been reviewing and assessing the
                information collected during the audit including written
                submissions, transcripts of interviews with company personnel,
                and the provision of adequate supporting documentation.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The Management System Audit Sub-Element&nbsp;2.1, Hazard
                Identification, Risk Assessment and Control, refers to the
                regulations that require a company to have procedures to
                identify all possible hazards, to assess the degree of risk
                associated with the hazas and to implement control measures to
                minimize or eliminate risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has implemented a system to identify and manage its
                operating and maintenance risk. Risks are calculated by
                incorporating the probability of events and the potential
                magnitude of the consequences. Records indicate that for
                pipelines and facilities, work is planned and risk-assessments
                are conducted with consideration given to safety, health, and
                the environment. TransCanada’s process for threat identification
                was reviewed for all threats and was assessed to be compliant
                with the requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified only one area of non-compliance in the
                sub-element of hazard identification, risk assessment and
                control. TransCanada developed a new management program for high
                pressure piping in gas facilities. This new program has been
                assessed and is adequate in terms of its content, but has not
                yet been fully implemented throughout all of TransCanada’s
                facilities.

                pipeline system. This is complemented by approximately
                80&nbsp;field technicians who execute integrity-related
                activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit determined that for gas and liquid pipeline IMPs,
                roles and responsibilities are well-defined and have adequate,
                dedicated resources. The audit also assessed TransCanada’s
                revised plant IMP, now known as the Facility, Integrity and
                Reliability Management Program (FIRM), and found that it
                addresses the roles and responsibilities that were lacking in
                the previous version.

                The Management System Audit Sub-Element&nbsp;3.3, Training,
                Competence and Evaluation, refers to the regulations that
                require a company to have a documented training program for
                employees and contractors related to the company’s management
                and protection programs. Training programs are expected to
                include program-specific policies, emergency preparedness,
                environmental response and information on the potential
                consequences of not responding appropriately. Training must also
                evaluate the competency to ensure knowledge requirements have
                been met.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents and records reviewed, the audit determined
                that TransCanada has developed effective methods to manage the

              <p>
                The Management System Audit Sub-Element&nbsp;3.7, Operational
                Control - Upset or Abnormal Operating Conditions, refers to the
                regulations that require a company to establish and maintain
                procedures to identify potential upset or abnormal operating
                conditions, accidental releases, incidents and emergency
                situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada has implemented a number of processes and procedures
                to identify potential upset or abnormal operating conditions.
                TransCanada’s pipeline infrastructure is monitored remotely
                24&nbsp;hours a day, 365&nbsp;days a year using a Supervisory
                Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and is backed up by
                an onsite standby system. In the event that both of these
                systems fail due to a catastrophic event, a secondary control
                centre at a different location contains full duplicate primary
                and secondary back-up systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                This audit also determined that TransCanada’s pressure-limiting
                and relieving systems, leak detection, gas quality, alarm
                call-out, shutdown devices and valve operation systems were all
                adequate and compliant with the OPR-99 and CSA-Z662-11
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                While over-pressure protection for TransCanada’s oil pipeline
                systems was found to be adequate, the Board has determined the
                NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd (NGTL) system is not conducting
                sufficient inspections or audits of its customer installations
                to ensure that the system is operated in compliance with the
                OPR-99 and CSA-Z662-11 requirements. Based on that system’s
                history of over-pressure incidents and the fact that TransCanada
                has not fully implemented its plan of action to verify
                compliance with requirements, the company is not in compliance
                with the OPR-99 and CSA-Z662-11 requirements and is therefore
                not in compliance with this audit sub-element.

                The Management System Audit Sub-Element&nbsp;4.1, Inspection,
                Measurement and Monitoring, refers to the regulations that
                require a company to develop and implement surveillance and
                monitoring programs including contract work being performed on
                behalf of the company. These programs are expected to include
                measures for evaluating a company’s management and protection
                programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents and records reviewed, the audit determined
                that TransCanada has developed and implemented a number of

              <ul>
                <li>
                  TransCanada’s position that ongoing monitoring of all shipped
                  commodities for sour crude on the Keystone pipeline is not
                  required since recent testing confirmed the current non-sour
                  nature of these products;
                </li>
                <li>
                  TransCanada’s inability to produce sufficient evidence proving
                  the adequacy of its ongoing integrity management programs for
                  corrosion on unpiggable sections of the NGTL system; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  background descriptions for the facility pipe inspection

                company to have a process to investigate incidents or any
                non-compliance that may occur, including a process to mitigate
                any potential or actual impacts arising from the
                non-compliances. The company is also required to develop
                procedures to analyze incident data in order to identify
                deficiencies and opportunities for proactive improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the course of this audit, TransCanada provided evidence
                of its analysis of possible incident types. The company also
                demonstrated it had compiled and analyzed key performance
                indicator data in order to assess trends and establish root
                causes of incidents.
              </p>
              <p>
                When issues or incidents are identified, the Board noted that
                TransCanada’s internal non-compliance and incident reporting
                processes were adequate but could be more detailed in the areas
                of preventative action and information sharing across the
                company. TransCanada has committed to improving the level of
                detail in these items.

                develop and implement a documented process for auditing its
                management and protection programs and procedures. The audit
                process is expected to include and manage training and
                competency requirements for staff carrying out the audits and be

              </p>
              <p>
                Internal audits of TransCanada’s IMPs are conducted by personnel

                On 1&nbsp;May&nbsp;2012, the Board received a submission from a
                complainant outlining allegations of regulatory non-compliance
                against TransCanada’s integrity management practices. These
                concerns were brought to the Board’s attention after the
                complainant had voiced similar concerns through TransCanada’s
                internal mechanisms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board had previously scheduled an audit of TransCanada’s
                Integrity Management Programs to start in the second quarter
                of&nbsp;2013. As a result of allegations of regulatory
                non-compliance brought to the Board by a then employee of
                TransCanada (complainant), the Board advanced the timing of its
                audit and integrated an assessment of the allegations within the
                scope and technical protocols developed for the audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s IMP audit conducted a detailed assessment of

                and preventative actions taken by TransCanada to address the
                allegations. Details of the Board’s verification for each
                complainant allegation are contained in the audit
                sub-element&nbsp;4.4, Internal Audit, in
                <a

                of this Audit Report. The Board’s audit has confirmed that the
                company has developed and implemented actions to correct and
                prevent similar occurrences for those issues confirmed to be
                valid. The Board’s audit also identified that some of the
                complainant’s allegations did not reflect issues of
                non-compliance with the regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board assessed relevant company procedures along with
                records of any corrective and preventative actions taken to
                address the allegations. The Board also assessed TransCanada’s
                internal investigation relating to its compliance with technical
                standards and procedures and notes that many of the allegations
                of regulatory non-compliance identified by the complainant were
                confirmed by TransCanada’s internal audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board’s audit has confirmed that as of the close of this
                audit, TransCanada has developed and implemented actions to
                correct and prevent similar occurrences for confirmed
                non-compliances identified by the complainant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board finds that TransCanada’s practices and procedures to
                deal with reporting of employee concerns at the time of the
                audit were not effectively implemented, supporting the Board’s
                Non-Compliant finding with the audit sub-element&nbsp;5.1
                Management Review.

              <p>
                NEB-regulated companies must demonstrate a proactive commitment
                to continual improvement in safety, security, and environmental
                protection. Pipeline companies under the Board’s regulation are
                required to incorporate integrity management programs into their
                day-to-day operations. These programs include the tools,
                technologies and actions needed to ensure that pipelines are
                safe and remain that way over time. Integrity management
                programs enable pipeline companies to predict and prevent
                failures.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that TransCanada is compliant in
                five&nbsp;sub-elements of this audit including:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled ">
                <li>
                  3.1 Organizational Structure, Roles and Responsibilities;

              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board has determined that TransCanada is non-compliant in
                four&nbsp;sub-elements of the audit including:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled ">
                <li>2.1 Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control;</li>
                <li>
                  3.7 Operational Control-Upset or Abnormal Operating
                  Conditions;
                </li>
                <li>4.1 Inspection, Measurement and Monitoring; and</li>
                <li>5.1 Management Review.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board is of the view that the processes presently used by
                TransCanada have identified the majority, and most significant,
                of its hazards and risks. Notwithstanding this, the audit
                identified that the non-compliant findings are related to the
                following contributing factors:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  recognition of all potential hazards and integrating them into
                  the program sub-elements that have been found to be
                  non-compliant, and
                </li>
                <li>
                  issues related to TransCanada’s internal management practices.
                  Examples of these include: over-reliance on lagging
                  indicators; inadequate consideration of NEB safety advisories
                  notifying where hazardous conditions existed and regulatory
                  requirements were not being met; and ineffective
                  implementation of internal practices to address the
                  complainant’s issues prior to Board notification.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                With respect to the Board’s investigation of the complainant’s
                allegations of regulatory non-compliance against TransCanada
                integrity management practices, the Board’s assessment has
                confirmed that TransCanada has now developed and implemented
                actions to correct and prevent similar occurrences for the
                confirmed issues. The NEB recognizes that even with a solid
                regulatory framework, it cannot be everywhere at every moment.
                That is why the Board encourages concerned individuals to voice
                their safety concerns with companies internally and, when
                necessary, to bring them to the attention of the Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board is also investigating certain steel pipe and fittings
                installed on the Keystone Pipeline with the potential to exhibit
                lower than specified yield strength. This investigation remains
                ongoing. Resolution of the investigation and any required
                remedial actions will be determined outside the audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                An effective and well-implemented Integrity Management Program
                is only part of the overall requirement for NEB-regulated
                companies. As of the time this audit report is released,
                separate and concurrent audits of TransCanada’s Safety,
                Environmental Protection, Emergency Management, Crossings and
                Public Awareness programs remain ongoing. The Board will make
                this Final Audit Report public and it will be posted on the
                Board’s website.
              </p>
              <p>
                TransCanada will be required to submit a CAP for Board approval
                within 30&nbsp;days of the Final Audit Report being issued,
                detailing how the company will address findings of
                non-compliance identified in this audit. The Board will conduct
                further compliance verification activities to confirm that the
                improvements outlined in the CAP are being proactively
                implemented in an expedient manner and on a system-wide basis.

                the NEB issued an updated Management System and Protection
                Program Audit Protocol. As this audit was ongoing at that time,
                it was continued under the former Audit Protocol, which is

                10&nbsp;April&nbsp;2013, the OPR-99 was amended and renamed the
                <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>
                (OPR). As this audit was ongoing at that time, it was continued
                under the OPR-99 and all references in this audit report are to
                the OPR-99 unless otherwise noted. Development of IMPs is also
                required under the OPR and any Non-Compliant finding in this
                audit under OPR-99 would also be a Non-Compliant finding under
                the OPR. TransCanada was also audited to the requirements of
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-11, <em>Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems</em>. These
                requirements remained unchanged during the audit.

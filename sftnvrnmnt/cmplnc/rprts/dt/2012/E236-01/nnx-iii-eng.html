                EBPC representatives indicated that Emera Inc., its parent
                company, has developed its own environmental management system
                which applies to all its companies. Further, EBPC identified
                that it had reviewed the Operator’s policy to ensure consistency
                with its own. The Operator’s Policy and Charter provides
                adequate direction and commitment to environmental protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                The policy was available at all workplaces and on the Operator’s
                primary intranet site and interviews confirmed that employees
                understood the policy and its application in their work.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Agreement
                between EBPC and its Operator, the Operator is implementing and
                maintaining the Environmental Protection program (EPP).
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews and document review indicated that the Operator is
                aware of the majority of the environmental hazards and aspects
                which could be associated with Brunswick Pipeline facilities. At
                the time of the audit, the Operator relied primarily on hazards
                identified for the project application and construction
                activities as opposed to an analysis of the hazard associated
                with or introduced by operations activities. The Operator also
                identified that it relies on its staff to proactively identify
                environmental hazards and aspects during pre-job analysis and
                contract development processes. A third source of hazard
                identification for operations were its measurement and
                monitoring activities (inspections and aerial patrols). Hazards
                identified through patrols were integrated into the Safety
                Evaluation Process and are applied to all environment, health
                and safety (EHS) processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator’s continued reliance on hazard information acquired
                during the application phase is an acceptable practice. Given
                the facilities are only a few years old, the present processes
                are adequate and use of information developed during the
                application and construction process is a prudent practice.
                However, the incorporation of the pre-existing and newly
                identified hazards should be more formally managed and
                documented. More specifically, confirmation of continued
                adequacy of data and methodologies should be done and formal
                links or requirements to application data should be incorporated
                into existing processes. If this integration of new and existing
                information is not done, the Operator risks not being in
                compliance in the future. In order to ensure and confirm the
                ongoing suitability of the processes, the construction processes
                should be reviewed, revised and formally adopted for the
                operation phase.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, the Operator provided evidence that it was
                updating its EHS procedures. This update included a formalized
                Operations Controls Table which systematically reviewed the
                regulated activities and identified potential controls for each
                issue or hazard. This process, while not being complete or
                implemented at the time of the audit, was viewed as appropriate
                to meeting the majority of the Board’s requirements for this
                element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore the Board recommends that the Operator ensure the
                complete the implementation of the Operations Control Table into
                the hazard identification processes to ensure environmental
                aspects for its operations and maintenance activities are
                appropriately addressed in procedures.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews with EBPC staff indicated that, while its staff
                monitors general NEB requirements, it relies on the Operator to
                develop and implement a process to identify and manage
                compliance issues and facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews with the Operator’s representatives indicated that it
                did not have a process for the formal and systematic
                identification of all of the applicable legislative and
                regulatory requirements which apply to the facilities. Lack of a
                demonstrated process does not necessarily identify lack of
                compliance; however, a formal process allows for a clear
                demonstration and assurance of compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews indicated that Operator staff are generally aware of
                legal requirements and apply them as required. Presently, the
                Operator’s staff remains current with company expectations
                through involvement with industry organizations and legal
                subscriptions.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the Operator was unable to provide appropriate legal lists
                as described above, staff indicated that, as part of the
                Operator’s internal HSE audit processes, legal lists are
                developed for inclusion in the audit protocols applicable to
                individual audits and therefore act as a form of legal review.
                The Operator provided an example of a legal list developed for
                implementation of other NEB regulated facilities’ audits.
                Examination of these documents indicated that they were not
                exhaustive of all required legislation and some applicable
                regulatory requirements were not included.
              </p>
              <p>
                As further demonstration of its compliance, the company provided
                the NEB with additional information following the issuance of
                the draft audit report which asserted that the procedures and
                commitments contained within its construction and operations
                environmental protection plan (EPP) included the necessary
                environmental compliance requirements. Further, this information
                had been vetted through the NEB approval process as a measure of
                its compliance. The Board notes that, while the EBPC EPP was
                reviewed for compliance during the application process, as part
                of its environmental protection program requirements, the
                company must develop and implement documented processes to
                actively monitor and integrate legal requirements on an on-going
                basis in order to ensure continued compliance.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company should have goals,

                and prevention initiatives, where appropriate.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPP. The
                Operator’s EHS policy contains generalized goals and objectives
                for its EHS management system (EHS MS). The policy contained
                action plans and objectives set out by the Operator’s Operations
                Committee, EHS Committee, as well as management and individual
                staff’s personal safety action plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                The membership of the Operations Committee and the EHS Committee
                consists of Vice Presidents of the various divisions. The
                committee provides reports and updates to the Operator’s senior
                management for review. As part of the implementation of the EHS
                programs, EHS goals, targets and objectives have been identified
                for all staff and are included in individual job descriptions.
                Employees are measured and are recognized for meeting EHS
                performance objectives as part of the “Short Term Incentive
                Programs”.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board identified that goals, objectives and targets, while
                managed appropriately, only marginally meet the present minimum
                requirements to be compliant and could be improved to address
                issues more relevant to EBPC operations and could better reflect
                measurable improvement of effectiveness of technical programs.
                It was noted that the goals focussed on broader regional issues
                such as improvements to compression related issues and issues
                more focussed on the North East (NE) United States (U.S.)
                facilities where the majority of the Operator’s activities are.
                Presently there are no compression facilities in Canada;
                therefore, the goals do not fully reflect the Brunswick Pipeline
                facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goals, targets and objectives are considered only marginally
                compliant in that they exist but are so general that they do not
                accurately reflect the technical programs and were not
                considered to apply specifically to Brunswick Pipeline
                operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, the Board recommends that the Operator demonstrate an
                ongoing process for monitoring goals, targets and objectives
                relevant to its Canadian facilities and programs to promote
                continual improvement requirements.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPP. The
                Operator has established an EHS Management Team with specific
                accountability for the EPP. Copies of job descriptions were
                reviewed to confirm that specific EHS responsibilities and
                accountabilities had been included. The development of an
                appropriate structure and roles and responsibilities for field
                activities was also verified. By examining organization charts,
                it was identified that the lines of reporting for EHS issues are
                clearly outlined, and include reporting routes which includes
                the Vice President, Operations NE Transmission; Manager,
                NE-Health &amp; Safety; EHS Support Specialist. Overall
                accountability for EHS issues is maintained by the Spectra EHS
                Committee (EHSC) which is comprised of senior EBPC personnel as
                well as representatives from the Operator’s Board of Directors.
                The Operator was able to demonstrate through documentation that
                this committee is functioning as planned. Quarterly records of
                reviews conducted by this committee were reviewed as part of
                this audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was noted that the organization and implementation of
                environmental procedures and practices at the field lies with
                the EHS Support Specialist with assistance of the regional
                Lands, Emergency Planning and Public Awareness Coordinators and
                the Operations Technicians. However, the audit was unable to
                verify that a formal, current job description existed for the
                EHS Support Specialist which included clearly articulated
                responsibilities and authorities. Based on staff interviews, it
                was clear that in practice the responsibilities were well
                understood. As well, document review of field staff job
                descriptions indicated that environmental roles and
                responsibilities were not fully documented. Interviews with
                Operator regional staff confirmed that the structure in practice
                was appropriate and reporting relationships were clear. However,
                job descriptions should be formalized and the various needs
                including training, reporting structure, etc. be more formally
                managed.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the document review and interviews, the audit also
                identified that the expectations of the EHS Support Specialist
                appeared to be significant for one person to manage and sustain.
                It was noted that the EHS management workload involved review
                and development of new practices and procedures and included
                oversight of activities involving contract management and
                on-sight activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator did not demonstrate that it had formally identified
                and defined environmental responsibilities for the EHS Support
                Specialist and regional technical staff that have key roles in
                the implementation of the EPP. As well, it is recommended that
                the Operator review the resourcing of EHS oversight to ensure
                that environmental protection can be maintained.

              <p>
                The Board noted that a Management of Change (MOC) process is in
                place which outlines the process to be followed for identifying,
                assessing and implementing changes once they have been approved
                by the responsible individuals (EHS MS Management of Change
                Performance Standard&nbsp;2.7). The Board also noted that there
                is currently a collaborative process to review all Standard
                Operating Practices (SOPs) against all applicable regulatory
                requirements and best practices (Canadian and U.S.). The EHS
                group is leading this process with support of senior management,
                and regional subject matter experts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the existing efforts being put in place for MOC, it
                could not be verified that the Operator had a fully compliant
                and implemented MOC procedure for the EHS program that included
                proactive, formal identification of required changes and
                analysis of the effects that the changes may have on related
                processes. The audit identified that the present MOC process is
                only partially implemented by various corporate technical area s
                (e.g. Safety, Environment, Engineering and Construction). Review
                of the Operator’s internal audit documentation for similar
                facilities identified issues with the implementation of the MOC
                and included plans for a corrective action.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator could not demonstrate an adequate MOC was a fully
                implemented process for the Brunswick Pipeline facilities and
                activities.

                environmental response requirements as well as the potential
                consequences of not following the requirements. The company
                should determine the required levels of competency for employees
                and contractors. Training shall evaluate competency to ensure
                desired knowledge requirements have been met. Training programs
                should include record management procedures. The training
                program should include methods to ensure staff remains current
                in their required training. The program should include
                requirements and standards for addressing any identified
                non-compliances to the training requirement.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                According to the O&amp;M agreement between EBPC and the
                Operator, the Operator is responsible for training of employees
                with EPP roles and responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator maintains records of all training required and
                completed by all workers. A training matrix applies to employees
                assigned to operating and maintaining the EBPC pipeline
                including the environmental responsibilities. This matrix
                consists of a list of core training courses and the frequency
                with which they are required. Administrative procedures in place
                notify employees of any updates to this matrix should additional
                training requirements be identified or should existing curricula
                be changed. Document review confirmed that the Human Resources
                Orientation checklist includes an EHS component and completion
                of the various components requires manager’s sign off.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator’s environmental training matrix was reviewed and it
                was found to be primarily focused on frontline staff (Operations
                Technicians) and that it did not include refreshment
                requirements for senior staff with environmentally related
                roles. It was also noted that here were no training or
                competency requirements for the Operator’s professional staff
                (EHS Support Specialist). This gap was considered significant as
                the majority of the environmentally related activities are
                coordinated or undertaken in this senior position.
              </p>
              <p>
                This element was evaluated as non-compliant due to the need to
                develop and implement on-going training requirements for all
                staff with environmental responsibilities.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPP.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it employs many
                methods for communicating environmental requirements with its
                internal and external stakeholders. Communication of EHS
                information takes place during safety stand down meetings;
                quarterly employee meetings and safety updates; daily tailgate
                meetings; daily and weekly safety reports; NE Region Health and
                Safety Newsletters; monthly safety and communications meetings;
                monthly reports to EHS Corporate group; contract management
                activities, pre-job meetings, its intranet sites; etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator could not demonstrate that it has an overarching
                communication plan that formally identifies and outlines the
                distribution of various types of information to appropriate
                parties. While interviews confirmed communication is occurring
                throughout technical networks and through the means identified
                above, without a formal communication plan, the Operator cannot
                ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties are
                receiving the appropriate information in a timely fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board noted that Emera Inc.’s internal environmental
                management system requirements outlines requirements for this
                plan, which, if implemented as designed and in conjunction with
                the Operator’s plan should result in a fully compliant
                communication plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the EPP communication plan was not implemented at the time of
                the audit, the Operator is found to be non-compliant.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company should have

                protection programs- where warranted. The documentation should
                be reviewed and revised at regular and planned intervals.
                Documents should be revised immediately where changes are
                required as a result of legal requirements or where failure to
                make immediate changes may result in negative consequences. The
                company should have procedures within its management and
                protection programs to control documentation and data as it
                relates to the risks identified in element&nbsp;2.0.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Document review confirmed that the Operator has implemented a
                comprehensive document management system which includes
                controlling and tracking all documents.  As well, the audit
                identified evidence that the documents are to undergo continual
                reviews and improvement which should include on-going
                monitoring, evaluation and updating of documents when required.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the existence of document management practices, the
                audit noted that the Operator is continuing to use the EPP
                developed during the application process for direction in
                undertaking operational environmental activities. Even though
                this pipeline is in operations this practice was viewed as
                appropriate at this time, given the length of time that this
                line has been operating and considering that the right-of- way
                (RoW) is still technically in a post-construction phase from an
                environmental perspective.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the Board recommends that the Operator  develop and
                implement a process to regularly review, adopt and document
                those practices required for the operation and maintenance of
                the facilities to ensure that it continues to be fit-for-purpose
                and incorporates all legal requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that EBPC has filed additional information with
                respect to this issue as part of its comments on the NEB Draft
                Audit Report. In its comments EBPC indicated that its EPP will
                be revised only as submitted to the Board as per its undertaking
                during its application. The Board notes that it expects
                companies to maintain dynamic programs which identify, evaluate
                and control hazards on an ongoing basis. EBPC should therefore
                ensure that its programs are updated on a regular and
                appropriate basis to meet the Board’s expectations regardless of
                its filings with the Board.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPP. Further,
                the Operator provided working documentation for the revision of
                EHS management processes and procedures which included a formal
                EHS Operations Control Table. The Operator uses this table to
                document and manage the issues which require the implementation
                of a control to minimize its effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted in Element&nbsp;2.1 and&nbsp;2.2 above, the Operator
                has not demonstrated that it has compliant processes for
                identifying all of its legal requirements and environmental
                aspects and risks. As legal requirements and environmental risks
                are integral in normal operating conditions, the Operator could
                not demonstrate that they had identified all controls required
                to be developed to assure protection of the environment.As well,
                as noted in Documentation and Document Control
                (Element&nbsp;3.5), the Operator was utilizing documents
                developed for construction activities as the primary procedures
                for the operation of the facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the Operator was unable to provide an adequate hazard
                identification process and document control procedures, it could
                not demonstrate that its procedures were adequately addressing
                all hazards. The Operator was unable to demonstrate whether it
                was anticipating and controlling its environmental risks
                appropriately.

                From an environmental perspective, because of the product
                (sweet, dry gas) and the minimal above ground facilities,
                environmental impacts related to upsets would be limited to the
                effects of the failure of slopes at either upland or watercourse
                crossings, the effects of loss of integrity at water course
                crossings, the release of small volumes of operationally related
                wastes or Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System
                managed products, or an unintended release of product into the
                atmosphere. Control of these issues would consist of application
                of normal operating procedures and practices (see
                Element&nbsp;3.6). No specific evaluation of this element was
                made as it relates to the EPP.

              <p>
                As part of its post-construction activities, the Operator was
                able to demonstrate that it reviews and evaluates the
                environmental success of the mitigation program applied during
                the construction of its facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Operator has procedures for various duties, the
                Board noted that staff were performing additional undocumented
                inspection activities as part of their everyday activities.  For
                instance, staff identified that when performing routine
                maintenance they were required to evaluate the environmental
                condition of the worksite. This evaluation is not documented in
                the procedure nor is it clear how the results are captured. In
                another similar example, the technical staff identified that
                they perform a full on-ground inspection of the RoW annually
                which was also not fully documented or appropriately recorded.
                While the Board concluded that both inspection activities are
                good and necessary practices, they exist outside the procedure
                and therefore could be accidentally discontinued.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recommends that the Operator ensure the thorough and
                formal documentation of activities that record environmental
                issues, requirements and inspection activities into its report
                requirements.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall develop and

                shall be conducted on a regular basis.

              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPP which
                includes internal auditing of the various programs. As a result
                of the relative newness of the facilities a full audit
                applicable to its operations environmental programs had not been
                completed at the time of the audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to assess the intended audit practice and program, the
                Board evaluated the requirements of the Operators’ audit process
                through the review of documents and records from internal audits
                conducted on the operator’s other NEB regulated facilities. It
                was confirmed that the Operator has an internal audit program
                developed and implemented as directed by management. The
                Operator indicated that it develops its audit specific content
                based on identified regulatory requirements and management
                system principles. There is mandatory follow-up and close-out of
                findings that are reported by internal third parties with
                company senior management holding responsible managers and staff
                accountable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The review of the program indicated that, the internal audit
                program was well documented and being appropriately implemented
                and managed. However, the program was not meeting the
                requirements of OPR-99 as it did not include an assessment of
                the adequacy of the EPP in meeting the requirements of
                Section&nbsp;48 of OPR-99 nor was the Operator able to
                demonstrate a formal and comprehensive identification and
                evaluation of all of EBPC’s regulatory requirements. Instead,
                the system relies on an informal, self identification of
                requirements by the facilities’ operating staff and management
                which does not allow for a systematic review of the requirements
                and could lead to missing requirements to remain unidentified
                and unmeasured.  Effectively, the audits completed presently are
                audits of conformance to the operator’s existing practices as
                opposed to audits of compliance against all of the regulatory
                requirements which are applicable as outlined in OPR-99.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board therefore recommends that the Operator amend its
                internal audit program to ensure requirements identified in
                OPR-99 and other referenced and regulatory documents are
                appropriately defined and that internal audits incorporate all
                regulatory requirements that apply to the Brunswick Pipeline and
                facilities. Further, during the audit, EBPC staff provided
                documentation of its parent company’s internal environmental
                management system which includes internal audit requirements.
                EBPC staff indicated that it was EBPC’s intention to ensure that
                practices implemented reflect the Emera Inc. environmental
                management system requirements. If EBPC implements its
                contemplated practices it could result in an effective and fully
                compliant process.

              <p>
                <strong>Expectations:</strong> Senior management should formally
                review the management and protection programs for continuing
                suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The review should be
                based on appropriate documentation and records including the
                results of the surveillance, monitoring and audit programs. This
                review should be formal and documented and should occur on a
                regular basis. The management review should include a review of
                any decisions, actions and commitments which relate to the
                improvement of the programs and the company’s overall
                performance.

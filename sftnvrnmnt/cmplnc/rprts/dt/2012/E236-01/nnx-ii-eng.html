              <p>
                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                Through the Operations and Maintenance Agreement (O&amp;M), EBPC
                has adopted the Operator’s Environment Health and Safety (EHS)
                policy, performance standards and safety action plan. EBPC
                demonstrated that it had its own policy statement applicable to
                its facilities. Further, EBPC identified that as part of its
                management oversight of the facilities, it was comparing the
                policy with that of the Operator to ensure consistency.
              </p>
              <p>The EHS policy includes the following principles:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Accountability</li>
                <li>Stewardship</li>
                <li>Standards</li>
                <li>Performance</li>
                <li>Communication</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The EHS Management System (MS) outlines how employees and
                contractors are expected to meet the desired level of EHS
                performance for the following elements:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Roles, responsibilities and accountabilities</li>
                <li>Risk management</li>
                <li>Emergency Preparedness &amp; Response</li>
                <li>Compliance management</li>
                <li>Supplier, Contractor and Partner Relationships</li>
                <li>Stewardship and community relations</li>
                <li>Goal setting and performance measurement</li>
                <li>Incident reporting and investigation</li>
                <li>Assessment and management system review</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Based on interviews and documents reviewed, the Board verified
                that EBPC has adopted the Operator’s EHS MS and that the
                commitment to managing its safety hazards and risks was visible
                at all levels within the organization.

                company should assess the degree of risk associated with these
                hazards. The company should be able to support the rationale for
                including or excluding possible risks in regard to its
                environment, safety, integrity, crossings and awareness and
                emergency management and protection programs (management and
                protection programs). The company should be able to implement
                control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.

              <p>
                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EHS MS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator uses a Risk Inventory and Job Safety Analysis (JSA)
                to assess EHS risk for various duties. The risk inventory method
                involves discussions with EHS, Operations, Maintenance, and
                other site personnel around specific scenarios. For each
                identified scenario, the team discusses how workers could be
                injured or the environment damaged and then critically evaluates
                adequacy of existing controls. The JSA method integrates risk
                assessment and control to the particular task completed in order
                to identify controls at specific locations.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was confirmed during field verification that the Operator
                incorporates existing procedures for completing Job Hazard
                Assessments; Hazard Identification and Reporting forms; Job
                Observation Checklists. Risk assessment workshops are held
                annually to support the risk management element of the EHS MS by
                establishing a forum to identify and evaluate EHS risks. Prior
                to the workshop, EHS personnel obtain feedback from across the
                organization, by interviewing a broad range of personnel. This
                data was used as the basis for the workshop.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to manage risks to contractors, the Operator has a
                health and safety management performance standard. This standard
                provides guidance for the registration, selection and oversight
                of all contractors performing work on the Brunswick Pipeline. A
                review and evaluation of contractor’s health and safety work and
                communication plans are developed in advance of the work to
                ensure they are appropriate to the risks of the work. This
                review ensures adequate internal and external oversight controls
                are part of the project review. It was confirmed during document
                review and interviews that various methods of communicating the
                EHS requirements to employees and contractors are in place. Upon
                the completion of the contract, contractor performance is
                reviewed and documented.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate through document review and
                interviews that hazard identification, risk assessments and
                controls are being conducted throughout the organization.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is responsible for developing, implementing and
                maintaining the EHS MS.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit it was identified that the Operator has
                developed a process which includes the identification and status
                of regulatory requirements and undertakings. An annual review is
                conducted of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure
                legislated requirements are met and a gap analysis is conducted
                by the Operator’s United States (U.S.) based staff to determine
                any next steps which may be required. The Director, Regulatory
                Affairs &amp; Government Relations is the primary point of
                contact with the NEB with regard to any compliance issues or
                changes to regulatory requirements. Upon receiving
                notification/correspondence from the NEB, the Director,
                Regulatory Affairs &amp; Government Relations forwards this
                information to the Operator as appropriate. Safety compliance
                issues and identified gaps are tracked within the appropriate
                management team of the operator as well as by the EHS Department
                and monitored by EBPC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of the development and intent of the processes
                described above, the Operator was unable to demonstrate the
                processes were being consistently implemented. During the audit,
                the Operator was not able to demonstrate that its processes
                included all of the Canadian OHS legislation which applied. For
                example, it was noted during document review and interviews that
                the
                <em>Canada Labour Code Part&nbsp;II</em> (CLC&nbsp;Part&nbsp;II)
                and the
                <em>Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations</em>
                (COSHR) were not included in any of the reference documents,
                making it difficult to verify whether the relevant requirements
                had been identified and integrated into these documents. As
                another significant example, at the time of the audit, the
                Operator was not able to demonstrate that it has a process that
                would meet the requirement to develop and implement a “Violence
                Prevention in the Workplace” program as required by CLC
                Part&nbsp;II&nbsp;125.1(z.16) and COSHR Section&nbsp;20 which
                came into effect in&nbsp;2008 (SOR/2008-148, s.&nbsp;1).
                Interviews with the Operator’s Human Resources personnel
                confirmed that the 'Violence in the Workplace Policy and
                Program' is currently under development; however, as the program
                was in the early stages of development, it could not be assessed
                for adequacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator did not demonstrate that it has an effective and
                fully implemented process to identify and integrate all
                appropriate occupational health and safety legislation into its
                Safety Program.

                plans. The membership of the Operations Committee and the EHS
                Committee consists of Vice Presidents of the various divisions.
                The committee provides reports/updates to senior management to

                Overall accountability for EHS issues is maintained by the
                Environment Health and Safety Committee (EHSC), which is
                comprised of senior personnel as well as representatives from
                the Board of Directors. Quarterly EHS reports are reviewed by
                the EHSC. An EHS Management Team has been established with
                specific accountabilities for safety. The Board reviewed copies
                of job descriptions to confirm that specific safety-related
                responsibilities and accountabilities are identified.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lines of reporting for safety issues are clearly outlined, and

                Operations Northeast (NE) Transmission; Manager, NE-Health &amp;
                Safety; and the EHS Support Specialist. The other line of

                Following interviews and reviews of job descriptions, the Board
                identified one concern regarding the expectations of the role of
                the EHS Support Specialist. The workload for this senior
                position appears to be significant for one person to manage. It
                was noted that the safety management workload involved review
                and development of new practices and procedures and included
                oversight of activities involving contract management and
                on-sight activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recommends that the Operator review the
                responsibilities of the EHS Support Specialist to ensure that
                environmental and safety protection is maintained and can remain
                effective.

                In regard to technical changes, EBPC indicated that it defers to
                the Operator as part of managing operations outlined in the
                O&amp;M agreement. The Operator demonstrated that it has a
                Management of Change (MOC) procedure in place which outlines the
                process to be followed for identifying, assessing and
                implementing changes once they have been approved by the
                responsible individuals (EHS MS Management of Change Performance
                Standard&nbsp;2.7).
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, the Operator staff is participating in a
                collaborative process to review all operational SOPs against all
                regulatory requirements and best practices (Canadian and U.S.).
                EHS is leading the process with support of Senior Management,
                and Regional subject matter experts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The MOC process is partially implemented by various disciplines
                and programs within the organization. However, at the time of
                the audit, there was no evidence provided to demonstrate a fully
                documented and implemented MOC program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator could not demonstrate an adequate MOC for oversight
                of its activities or that there is an adequate fully implemented
                MOC process in place for EBPC facilities and activities to
                identify, document and analyze changes that could affect the EHS
                MS, including introduction of new risks, hazards or legal
                requirements.

                According to the O&amp;M agreement between EBPC and the
                Operator, the Operator is responsible for training of employees.
                The Operator has developed a safety training matrix that applies
                to employees assigned to operating and maintaining the Brunswick
                pipeline. This matrix consists of a list of core safety training
                courses and the frequency with which they are required. Some of
                the mandatory safety training is delivered online. Document
                review confirmed that the Operator maintains records of all
                training required and completed by all workers. Employees are
                provided with any updates to this matrix should additional
                training requirements be identified or should existing
                curriculums be changed. The Board also reviewed the Human
                Resources Orientation checklist which includes a safety training
                component that requires manager’s sign off.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has an adequate and
                effective safety training program which ensures employees are
                able to fulfill their roles and responsibilities.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EHS MS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it employs many
                methods for communicating safety requirements with its internal
                and external stakeholders. Communication of safety information
                takes place during safety stand down meetings; quarterly
                employee meetings and safety updates; daily tailgate meetings;
                daily and weekly safety reports; NE Region Health and Safety
                Newsletters; monthly safety and communications meetings; monthly
                reports to EHS Corporate group; contract management activities,
                pre-job meetings, its intranet sites; etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although there are several communication mechanisms in place,
                the Operator could not demonstrate that there is a formalized
                and implemented overarching communication plan that outlines the
                distribution of various types of information to appropriate
                parties. While interviews confirmed communication is occurring
                throughout technical networks and through the means identified
                above, without a formal communication plan, the Operator cannot
                ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties are
                receiving the appropriate information in a timely fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the documented communication which takes place during
                the various meetings. Within the safety program, the Board could
                not verify that a formalized communication plan exists within
                the organization that clearly identifies interested parties and
                pertinent safety information that is required to be
                communicated.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company should have

                protection programs- where warranted. The documentation should
                be reviewed and revised at regular and planned intervals.
                Documents should be revised immediately where changes are
                required as a result of legal requirements or where failure to
                make immediate changes may result in negative consequences. The
                company should have procedures within its management and
                protection programs to control documentation and data as it
                relates to the risks identified in element&nbsp;2.0.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EHS MS which
                includes the management of operational documents and manuals.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was confirmed that a comprehensive document management system
                is in place, which includes control and transmittal tracking of
                all safety related documents. The Board was able to verify that
                the document management system undergoes continual monitoring,
                evaluation and updating of documents when required.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, during the document review, version control issues with
                selected safety program documents were identified. For example,
                although not the most current version of the standard,
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-03 was referenced in procedures throughout the
                Operations and Maintenance Manual. There was no evidence
                suggesting that the outdated reference was indicative of a
                systemic issue as the Integrity Management Program Manual and
                the Emergency Preparedness Manual referenced the
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-07.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is recommended that the Operator update the Operations and
                Maintenance Manual to reflect the current CSA standard. This
                reference update ensures that users of the document can trace a
                requirement as referenced in the manual and obtain the most
                up-to-date requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has adequate
                documentation and controls in place to ensure that the EHS MS
                provides the appropriate level of guidance to employees.

                The Operator uses a Health and Safety Standards Manual that
                contains procedures for controlling identified risks associated
                with tasks typically encountered by operations personnel. The
                procedures reference and acknowledge compliance with applicable

                Unit Leadership in setting priorities and allocating resources
                to adequately manage the EHS element of operational risk. Also

                The Operator has developed and implemented a comprehensive
                incident investigation process is in place. The incident
                reporting and investigation process includes significant near
                misses and includes contractors in incident investigations, when
                appropriate. The investigation process identifies root causes
                and trends that lead to corrective and preventive action. The
                Operator tracks the actions until completion and verifies their
                effectiveness. Incidents are analyzed to detect patterns or
                trends to anticipate and prevent future incidents. The incidents
                and accidents are recorded and reported as per policy. Best
                practices and lessons learned are shared with others who can
                benefit.

                The Board verified that the Operator has adequate processes to
                ensure safety related incidents are investigated and the
                appropriate measures are taken to correct or prevent further
                deficiencies in its execution of the EHS MS.

                retained, retention and disposition timeframes and disposal
                methods. Copies of all records requested were made readily
                available. The Operator maintains safety and incident data using
                its EPASS system with hard copy records being maintained in the
                regional offices.

                During interviews, staff indicated that Operator’s internal
                safety audits are conducted by the Operator’s Manager, Internal
                Audits. The audit planning cycle is determined by a
                comprehensive risk assessment. The 28&nbsp;September&nbsp;2009
                EHS MS audit commissioned by the Operator was reviewed along
                with the audit response report which shows the progression of
                remedial action to address non-compliances identified in the
                audit. Remedial action is tracked in the EPASS system to ensure
                actions items are closed-out. To ensure all legislated
                responsibilities are included, local subject matter experts are
                contracted to ensure appropriate legislation is included for the
                facilities being audited.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is recommended that the Operator choose an appropriate audit
                schedule and complete an internal audit of the safety of its
                operations and maintenance activities in the near future.

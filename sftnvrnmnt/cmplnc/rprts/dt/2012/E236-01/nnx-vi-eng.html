                As part of an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Agreement
                between EBPC and its Operator, the Operator is implementing and
                maintaining the Public Awareness Program (PA).
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the Operator’s Public Awareness Plan,
                <em
                  >“the purpose of the[PA] program is to educate specific
                  audiences on responsibilities surrounding, living and working
                  near EBPC’s pipelines. Public Awareness is one of the key
                  components of safe-guarding the integrity of the
                  pipeline...”</em
                >
                According to the Operator’s staff responsible for implementing
                the plan, the PA program is part of the larger public safety
                policy and there are only minor changes to the PA Program each
                year. Since the EBPC project is currently completing the
                transition from construction to operation, there were additional
                awareness activities and messaging activities being completed by
                EBPC public relations staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both EBPC and the Operator were able to demonstrate that there
                is a policy that outlines the PA Program and its goals which is
                administered by the Operator’s senior staff.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the PA Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews with staff and policy review indicate that the
                Operator considers PA activities to be important controls in
                addressing the hazards imposed by third parties who live and
                work around the pipeline. The Public Awareness, Emergency
                Preparedness and Lands Coordinator (Coordinator) has developed
                the plan based on knowledge of activities in the area and groups
                that could potentially pose a risk to the pipeline. For example,
                all-terrain-vehicle (ATV) drivers on the Right-of-Way (RoW) have
                been identified as a hazard because it can cause rutting on the
                RoW and a disturbance for the landowner. As a result, the
                Operator staff contacted the local ATV and snowmobile
                associations to discuss the trespass and rutting issues. Another
                example of a local group that poses a hazard is the logging
                companies that are known to cross the pipeline with heavy loads.
                The Operator has worked to establish a relationship with these
                companies in the area to promote awareness of the pipeline. As
                part of the PA plan, the Coordinator contacts these groups
                annually to re-affirm the message about safe work and recreation
                on pipeline RoW.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was verified that the Coordinators have assessed the risks
                that certain groups pose to the pipeline and have incorporated
                them into the PA Plan. Document review and interviews verified
                that the Operator has identified its hazards as it relates to PA
                activities and has implemented appropriate controls to minimize
                the associated risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Operator evaluates the external hazards introduced
                by third parties to the pipeline, PA activities are not included
                in the Safety Program’s Job Hazard Assessment which is intended
                to identify the possibility of any work related hazard for its
                employees. As public engagement activities introduce the
                potential for hostility from third parties, this hazard should
                be evaluated in the Operator’s safety program. Given the Canada
                Labour Code requirement for a “Violence in the Workplace
                policy”, the Board recommends that the Operator include PA
                activities among those assessed for hazards and that those risks
                be mitigated accordingly. (See Element&nbsp;2.1 of
                Appendix&nbsp;II -&nbsp;Safety Program)

              <p>
                For operational legal requirements, the Operator relies on staff
                participation in industry groups such as CSA and Canadian Energy
                Pipelines Association as well as regulatory updates posted on
                relevant government websites to relay regulatory information
                back to the appropriate staff for incorporation into procedures.

              <p>
                Although the Operator has established a PA Program as required
                by the PCR, it has not yet assessed the effectiveness of the PA
                Program as required by the
                <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Crossing Regulations</em>
                (PCR) Part&nbsp;II subsection&nbsp;4(2). Document review
                confirmed that the PCR Part&nbsp;II subsection&nbsp;4(2)
                requirement to assess the effectiveness of the program has been
                identified and included in the PA plan. However, the evaluation
                process or criteria was not available for evaluation. As the
                pipeline was in operation for less than one&nbsp;year an
                assessment of effectiveness had not been done at the time of the
                audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recommends that the Operator develop and implement a
                process to assess the effectiveness of the PA program as
                required in the PCR.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                During the transition phase from construction to operation,
                EBPC’s community relations strategy included a large awareness
                component and separate events were planned such as a celebration
                of the green space in Rockwood Park and a funding initiative for
                local volunteer fire departments. Although the EBPC public
                relations initiatives will be ongoing, the PA Program for the
                Brunswick Pipeline is managed and executed by the Operator in
                New Brunswick as part of an O&amp;M Agreement. To that end, the
                Operator has integrated EBPC facilities into its existing PA
                plan that is currently developed, executed and tracked by the
                Coordinator. The Coordinator establishes annual goals and
                targets including the timing of the mail-outs and the number of
                the presentations to key audiences. The Coordinator also
                leverages other pipeline companies that are now in the area to
                support joint awareness activities. Along with presentations to
                target groups, they also submit “Call before you dig” ads for
                publication in local trade journals as well as sponsoring
                related events such as contractor breakfasts. All of these
                activities are recorded and tracked.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board verified through documentation review including the PA
                Plan and confirmed that the Operator has set annual goals for
                the PA Program to ensure the appropriate audiences are receiving
                awareness information.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between EBPC and its Operator,
                the Operator is implementing and maintaining the PA Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Coordinator is accountable for the development and the
                execution of the PA Program. This position reports to the RoW
                Manager of the northeast region in Head Office (Waltham, MA).
                According to the Operator’s area and regional managers, the
                Coordinator position functions with little oversight of the
                awareness program. Although there is no direct supervision for
                this position in the office, interviews confirmed that the
                Coordinator reports his awareness activities for the Brunswick
                Pipeline facilities to EBPC staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Coordinator is responsible for the planning and delivery of
                the various aspects of the PA Program from coordinating the
                mail-outs to conducting all of the presentations to key
                audiences both planned and on request. This position is the sole
                employee responsible for the delivery of public awareness for
                the Brunswick Pipeline with administrative assistance for the
                landowner mail-outs. During interviews, staff indicated that the
                delivery and maintenance of the PA Program requires
                approximately&nbsp;20% of his overall time. This position also
                has senior level responsibilities with the third party crossings
                and emergency response programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Board verified that the current structure allows
                for the execution of the PA Program as described in the existing
                PA Plan. However, if circumstances change, enhancements to the
                program are required, or the number of PA activities required
                increases over time, the Operator may not be able carry out its
                PA Program with the current level of staffing. It is therefore
                recommended that the Operator review the resourcing of the PA
                Program to ensure that the program continues to meet awareness
                needs and the regulatory requirements for effectiveness.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                With the Brunswick Pipeline in its operational phase, EBPC has
                included the management and implementation of the PA Program in
                the O&amp;M Agreement with the Operator. Although there was no
                formal re-evaluation of the PA program as a result of the
                Brunswick Pipeline facilities, there was an evaluation of the
                impact of increased number of landowners on the PA program.
                Based on this evaluation, it was determined that additional
                administrative support was required to assist with PA program
                meeting its targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Operator had an initiative underway to develop and
                implement a formal management of change (MOC) program for its
                protection programs, at the time of the audit, the Operator did
                not demonstrate that the PA Program would be included in the MOC
                program.

                environmental response requirements as well as the potential
                consequences of not following the requirements. The company
                should determine the required levels of competency for employees

                Review of the Operator’s training program concluded that the
                Coordinator receives communication training as part of the
                Emergency Management Program. Document review revealed that
                there was no training given related specifically to PA
                activities and no evaluation had been done to identify training
                requirements. At the time of the audit, skill development for
                routine PA activities had not been evaluated to determine if
                additional training was required. Interviews confirmed that
                there are no succession plans in place for this position.
                Instead, as a long term employee working in the area, the
                Coordinator relies on his considerable and varied experience to
                perform his PA related duties and respond to concerns.

              <p>
                According to staff, the Coordinator reviews the PA program and
                adjusts it as required. The target audiences have been
                identified based on landowner issues and groups that will be
                working around the pipelines. Presentations to high risk groups
                are an essential component of a PA program. The Board reviewed
                the presentations for content and considered them to be
                comprehensive and appropriate for the intended audiences. The
                Coordinator also receives requests to conduct tailored
                presentations from groups such as municipalities, ATV
                associations, forestry contractors and park rangers. The
                Operator also partners with local construction companies, other
                buried infrastructure companies to hold contractor breakfasts
                and sponsor ads about safe digging in local trade journals. The
                Operator conducts an annual mail out for all Landowners in New
                Brunswick to remind them of the safety considerations when
                working around the pipeline. The Brunswick Pipeline website is
                another aspect of the communication with external stakeholders.
                It was confirmed that the website provides adequate safety and
                contact information related to presence of the pipeline and the
                instructions for contacting the Operator for permission to
                conduct work near the pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Document review and interviews confirmed that the Operator has
                communication processes in place that allow it to effectively
                communicate activities related to its pipelines with external
                stakeholders. Internal communication with EBPC takes place in
                the weekly calls. External PA activities are discussed as a
                standing agenda item.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although there are several communication mechanisms in place,
                the Operator could not demonstrate that there is a formalized
                and implemented overarching communication plan that outlines the
                distribution of various types of information to appropriate
                parties. While interviews confirmed communication is occurring
                through the means identified above, without a formal
                communication plan, the Operator cannot ensure that all
                stakeholders and interested parties are receiving the
                appropriate information in a timely fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although there is communication regarding awareness activities
                occurring, the Board recommends that the Operator include PA
                program related information into the overarching formalized
                communication plan.

                With the Brunswick Pipeline in its operational phase, EBPC has
                included the management and implementation of the PA Program in
                the O&amp;M Agreement with the Operator required by the PCR

                The Operator manages the PA Program related documentation in the
                Fredericton, NB office. The administrator maintains the system
                manually by posting most recent procedures on the Area
                Share-point site which is available on an internal network. The
                administrator also plays a key role in the control of changes to
                the Operations and Maintenance Procedures which are executed
                through revision request forms. Once the procedure is changed,
                the administrator posts the new procedures to the internal
                network. The administrator is the central resource for
                controlling the process related documents and reports. The
                Coordinator maintains the PA related documents and presentations
                used for the in hard copy.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Operator provided documentation which describes its PA
                Program, and demonstrated that changes to the document are
                controlled and the most current versions are made available
                electronically.

              <p>
                According to the PCR, the company must have a program that makes
                people aware of the pipeline and provides them with instructions
                for obtaining permission to work safely around the pipeline. The
                PA Plan was reviewed on site to verify that it included all
                required safety information for those people who live and work
                around the pipeline. Interviews with staff conclude that the PA
                plan is developed based on the risks by third parties and PA
                activities are developed to mitigate those risks. The Operator’s
                program has evolved over time to include not only landowners,
                but other potentially relevant parties such as local excavators,
                municipalities and local outdoor activity associations. It also
                includes forestry companies as they tend to carry heavy loads
                over the pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was verified that the Operator has implemented a process to
                communicated mitigative, preventive and protective measures to
                address the hazards and risks associated with its activities.

                Upset conditions for crossing related activities would
                constitute an emergency and would be mitigated as per the

              <p>
                As noted elsewhere in this report, the Coordinator reviews the
                PA program annually to ensure that there is contact with the
                identified target groups. These target audiences have been
                identified based on landowner issues and groups that will be
                working around the pipelines. The Operator demonstrated that it
                tracks and reports on awareness activities conducted in a given
                year. The Board reviewed the awareness material and
                presentations and did not note any deficiencies in the
                information. However, the Board could not verify that the
                Operator had formally assessed the effectiveness of the PA
                program as required by the PCR.

                In addition to conducting PA presentations as a preventive

                and presentations regarding safe work practices to parties that
                have contravened the PCR. Depending on the severity of the
                activity and the likelihood of a recurrence, the Coordinator
                will conduct safety presentations or awareness sessions with the

                With the Brunswick Pipeline in its operational phase, EBPC has
                included the management and implementation of the PA Program in
                the O&amp;M Agreement with the Operator. The Operator maintains
                records of PA activities in the New Brunswick office which
                include records of each event attended and each presentation
                given. Information such as the list of stakeholder groups as
                well as participation in awareness activities with other
                agencies promoting safe work practices around buried
                infrastructure can also be found in the office. Document review
                onsite confirmed that records of PA activities have been
                maintained in the Fredericton, New Brunswick office since the
                program was established.

              <p>
                Records containing landowner contact information are also
                integral to the success and effectiveness of the annual mailout
                of awareness material. The Coordinator uses a database to manage
                landowner contact information. Review of records management
                procedures and interviews with field staff found the following
                deficiencies in the process for managing this information:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Verification of the accuracy of the landowner information
                  takes place following the annual mail-outs. Staff make
                  corrections when the letters are sent back “return to sender”
                  or the new residents contact them to correct the addressee
                  information. This process relies heavily on the new residents
                  self-identifying by returning mail and could result in the
                  inaccuracy of the information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Damage prevention awareness information is mailed to known
                  landowners. People who are renting properties along the right
                  of way receive damage prevention awareness material only as
                  part of the Emergency Management program. As such, it is
                  unclear whether they are made aware that they reside not only
                  in the Emergency Planning Zone, but on a property with a
                  pipeline easement. Those people who live on an easement have
                  legal obligations, safety considerations as well as
                  expectations of the pipeline company over and above those of
                  other EPZ residents. The company should ensure that they are
                  aware of the distinction.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                During interviews field staff indicated that there is not a
                rapid rate of landowner turnover. However, as development
                encroaches on the pipeline, the current system of managing
                landowner information may not allow EBPC’s awareness material in
                the future to reach the people who need to know and would put
                EBPC in non-compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recommends that the Operator reassess the maintenance
                procedure for landowner contact information as well as how they
                ensure people residing on an easement are informed about damage
                prevention to ensure that the PA Program can remain effective in
                communicating to landowners.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                With the Brunswick Pipeline in its operational phase, EBPC has
                included the management and implementation of the PA Program in
                the O&amp;M Agreement with the Operator. According to the PCR,
                companies must assess the effectiveness of the PA program. As
                the Brunswick Pipeline is still in its first&nbsp;year of
                operation, there would not be adequate information to conduct an
                effective audit of its operational programs relating to public
                awareness.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recommends that the Operator conduct an audit of the
                management and protection programs including Public Awareness to
                ensure compliance with legal requirements and to verify that the
                programs are being implemented as designed.

              <p>
                <strong>Expectations:</strong> Senior management should formally
                review the management and protection programs for continuing
                suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The review should be
                based on appropriate documentation and records including the
                results of the surveillance, monitoring and audit programs. This
                review should be formal and documented and should occur on a
                regular basis. The management review should include a review of
                any decisions, actions and commitments which relate to the
                improvement of the programs and the company’s overall
                performance.

                Emera Brunswick Pipeline Company’s (EBPC) Integrity Management
                Program (IMP) document, dated March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2010 was
                developed and implemented by the Operator. It includes
                Section&nbsp;2: Corporate Policies, Objectives, and
                Organization. Subsection&nbsp;2.1 includes a Policy and
                Objectives description of short term (1-4&nbsp;years) and long
                term (5-10&nbsp;year) plans for all integrity related program
                developments, including hazard identification, inspection and
                investigation and maintenance activities for all pipelines
                included within the scope of the document. The IMP Policy is
                endorsed and approved by the Operator’s senior management and
                had been adopted by EBPC. In addition, there is the Pipeline
                Integrity Oversight Committee (PIOC), whose mandate it is to
                administer the IMP for all of the Operator’s Canadian regulated
                pipelines. PIOC committees are comprised of the Operator’s
                senior management including: Director, Pipeline Integrity
                (Houston), Manager, Pipeline Design (Houston), Manager,
                Metallurgical Services (Houston), Director, Operations
                Compliance (Houston), Director, Facilities Operations (Houston),
                Director, Technical Operations (Southeast Region), Director,
                Technical Operations (Northeast Region).

              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews, the Operator was
                able to demonstrate that it has a policy which commits to
                continual improvement and is communicated to its staff.

                  ><strong>RiskAnalyst</strong></em
                >) offered and administrated by Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems,
                Inc. The Operator has segmented this pipeline system into
                logical and logistical segments. This dynamic segmentation
                allows the risk values of individual segments to be calculated
                so that the overall risk of one segment to another can be
                compared. The hazards input into the program include: internal
                corrosion, external corrosion, stress corrosion cracking,
                manufacturing, construction, equipment and weather-related and
                outside forces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator’s integrity management team has recognized the
                possibility of internal corrosion and has committed to implement
                a corrosion control program on all pipelines. The program would
                follow the Operator’s Standard Operating  Procedure (SOP)
                Volume&nbsp;2 -&nbsp;Corrosion, 2-3010 Internal Corrosion
                Monitoring and Mitigation which includes maintenance pigging and
                analysis of any deposits resulting from the pipeline pigging.
                The pigging program would have a targeted frequency of twice per
                year per pipeline segment, but ultimately the frequency for each
                pipeline would be assessment based. The integrity management
                team also indicated that during the harmonization and revision
                of the IMP, Section&nbsp;8.3.2 Internal Corrosion would be
                revised from “internal corrosion is not considered a viable
                threat” to reflect that there is some evidence that internal
                corrosion should be considered, and thus mitigated. Based on the
                evidence presented to the Board during the audit, the Board is
                of the opinion that internal corrosion will be appropriately
                monitored and mitigated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews, the Operator was
                able to demonstrate that it has a program to identify its
                hazards and associated risk and mitigate the risk appropriately.

              </p>
              <p>
                The IMP document, in addition to the SOP’s, provide sufficient
                detail to support the effective implementation of the IMP
                elements as well as ensuring that the inspection, measurement,
                monitoring and maintenance activities are conducted in
                accordance with EBPC’s specifications.

              <p>
                Although there are several formalized communication mechanisms
                being implemented for the IMP, the Operator could not
                demonstrate that there is an overall formalized and implemented
                communication plan that outlines the content and required
                distribution of various types of information to appropriate
                parties. While interviews confirmed communication is occurring
                through technical networks and through the means identified
                above, without a formal communication plan, the Operator cannot
                ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties outside of
                the Integrity program are receiving the appropriate information
                in a timely fashion. For example, a formalized communication
                would identify what IMP information needs to be communicated to
                management to assist in planning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews with operations
                staff, the Operator was able to demonstrate that it has
                effective communication to inform all interested persons of
                activities related to its IMP. The Board recommends that the
                Operator include identified IMP information in the overarching
                formalized communication plan.

                During a preceding audit of the Operator for the M&amp;NP
                Pipeline, its pigging procedures as, documented, were compared
                to actual field practices. SOP, Volume&nbsp;1 -&nbsp;Pipeline,
                Procedure Number&nbsp;1-5030 states “The following procedures
                for running pigs demonstrate general practices only; operating
                personnel shall develop and implement site specific procedures
                and thoroughly familiarize themselves with the requirements of
                these procedures prior to their use and
                operation.” Additionally, pigging has been recognized as a
                hazard in the O&amp;MSM, Section&nbsp;04: Cleaning, Testing and
                Purging, Reference&nbsp;05: Pipeline Pigging -&nbsp;General
                where it states that “Pigging is extremely dangerous when done
                incorrectly”. Item&nbsp;#3 in this document states “The pigging
                barrel is a pressure vessel. Operations involving opening of the
                door should be done with extreme care as the energy stored in
                high-pressure gas is sufficient to tear the door off its hinges
                and launch a pig out of the barrel at high velocity. Assurance
                that the barrel is fully vented is the pigging crew’s
                responsibility and is a major factor to their personal safety.”
              </p>
              <p>
                At this point, due to the short time in operation, the Operator
                has not performed pipeline pigging (cleaning runs or ILI) on the
                Brunswick Pipeline. In the future, as a result of the internal
                corrosion program to be implemented in&nbsp;2011, maintenance
                pigging programs will be initiated. This increased exposure to
                operations personnel necessitates detailed, accurate and
                complete procedures for each pig launcher and receiver to
                identify site specific hazards and mitigate the risks associated
                with pipeline pigging.
              </p>
              <p>
                A site inspection of the pig launcher and receiver at the Red
                Head facility revealed that both the launcher and receiver had
                been constructed with concentric versus eccentric reducers.
                While this type of design does not contravene any code or
                standard, it can pose a problem during pig launching. The
                concentric reducer makes it difficult to achieve a tight seal on
                the front pig cup because the pig is tilted rather than level in
                the launch position.   The lack of a tight seal, especially in a
                gas line, can mean that repeated attempts are required to seal
                the pig in the reducer to achieve a successful launch.
                Repeatedly pressurizing, depressurizing and purging the pig
                launcher can lead to operator frustration and possibly to taking
                shortcuts in the pigging procedure. These factors can increase
                the possibility of injury to operations personnel. The Operator
                was unaware of this potential situation when Board auditors
                identified it to operations personnel during the audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recommends that in order to prevent this situation
                from occurring in future pigging operations, when the site
                specific pigging procedures are developed and documented for
                Brunswick Pipeline facilities, they should incorporate special
                instructions to operations personnel to address this unique
                design of its facilities.

                As part of an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Agreement
                between EBPC and its Operator, the Operator is implementing and
                maintaining the integrity management program (IMP).
              </p>
              <p>
                The IMP, Section&nbsp;13: Inspection, Testing, Patrols and
                Monitoring outlines the procedures to conduct inspections,
                testing, patrols and monitoring in accordance with
                Clauses&nbsp;9 and&nbsp;10 of CSA&nbsp;Z662-07. The detailed
                procedures are contained in the Operator’s SOPs. The SOP’s have
                been “harmonized” such that the requirements for the U.S. and
                Canadian regulators are specified in terms of specific tasks and
                the frequencies of those tasks. The SOP’s have been organized to
                address threat specific requirements. For example, IMP
                Section&nbsp;1.6: Inspection and Damage Prevention contains
                ten&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;procedures covering pipeline Right-of-Way
                (RoW) patrols and leakage surveys. IMP Section&nbsp;2.2:
                External Corrosion includes thirty&nbsp;(30)&nbsp;detailed
                procedures with the focus on cathodic protection inspection,
                testing and monitoring. Review of the Annual Cathodic Protection
                Survey Report for&nbsp;2009 indicated that the survey scope
                (test points) and results (NACE criteria) met regulatory
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2 states that the frequency
                of pipeline patrolling shall be determined by considering such
                factors as: operating pressure, pipeline size, population
                density, etc., which are risk-based considerations. The
                inclusion of risk-based frequencies as required by
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 is evident in SOP&nbsp;1-6010 Pipeline Patrol
                and Leakage Survey Frequency Criteria, which specifies bi-weekly
                aerial RoW patrols.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure appropriate documentation and records of the
                inspection, surveillance and monitoring programs, each SOP
                contains links imbedded in the electronic document to the
                “Reporting” and “Forms” requirements upon completion of the SOP
                tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of data integration and analysis, IMP
                Section&nbsp;13.2: Evaluation of Inspection, Testing, Patrol and
                Monitoring Results stipulates that upon completion of each task,
                the results are evaluated to determine whether a potential
                threat exists, and when the results indicate the presence of
                conditions that might lead to a failure incident with
                significant consequences or to an external interference
                incident, an engineering assessment is to be performed in
                accordance with CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 Clause&nbsp;10.14.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of risk assessment, IMP Section&nbsp;9.2.2: Review of
                Previous Integrity Management Processes states that information
                gained from integrity audits, performance metrics, integrity
                assessments and mitigative actions (i.e.&nbsp;Inspection,
                Testing, Patrols and Monitoring) over the previous year will be
                incorporated into the annual updating of the risk information
                for each threat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews with operations
                staff, the Operator was able to demonstrate that it has
                surveillance and monitoring programs to address its hazards and
                risks as it relates to the IMP.

                improve its IMP. While CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 Annex N is not
                specifically a requirement of the NEB, EBPC has chosen to adopt
                it and therefore must meet the requirements of
                Annex&nbsp;N.17.2(a) through&nbsp;(f) which include: audit scope
                and objectives, audit frequency and timing, responsibilities for

                competency and audit procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recommends that the Operator amend its internal audit

                referenced and regulatory documents are appropriately defined
                (see also Element&nbsp;2.2 Legal Requirements) and that internal
                audits incorporate all regulatory requirements that apply to the
                Brunswick Pipeline and facilities. Further, during the audit,
                EBPC staff provided documentation of its parent company’s
                internal environmental management system which includes internal
                audit requirements. If EBPC implements its contemplated
                practices it could result in an effective and fully compliant
                process.

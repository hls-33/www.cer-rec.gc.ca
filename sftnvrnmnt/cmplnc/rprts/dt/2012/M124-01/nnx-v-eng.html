                As part of an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Agreement
                between M&amp;NP and its Operator, the Operator is implementing
                and maintaining all aspects of the safety program including
                activities related to third party activities near the M&amp;NP
                system. During the audit, it was noted that the Operator’s
                crossing or third party activities are subsumed in the
                Operator’s O&amp;M activities that are adequately addressed by
                the corporate safety policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board also noted that the safety policy has been integrated
                by the Operator’s staff when working with third parties. During
                the interviews, Staff consistently emphasized their personal
                accountability for public and worker safety when they inspect or
                observe crossing-related activities. Technical staff described
                personal authority and obligation to intervene with third
                parties to ensure that the procedures were being adhered to
                during crossing activities.

                emergency management and protection programs (management and
                protection programs). The company should be able to implement
                control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining all
                aspects of the safety program including activities related to
                third party excavation and construction activities near the
                M&amp;NP system. By reviewing the hazard identification process,
                the Board noted that the Operator had identified the common
                crossing-related hazards for communication to its staff and the
                public. Common hazards for third parties are included in the
                third party information such as the Crossing Guidelines as well
                as within related internal procedures.

                Additionally, document review showed that specific hazards
                related to crossing projects are addressed in pre-job safety
                meetings and noted in the pre-job checklist to identify and
                control the hazard associated with each crossing activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further to these processes, operations field staff identified
                that it is routine practice to proactively identify and address
                potential crossing hazards where possible including
                communicating directly with third party workers near the rights
                of way. If staff observe unattended excavation equipment parked
                near the RoW, they will leave a brightly coloured note on the
                equipment to notify third party operators that there is a high
                pressure gas pipeline in the vicinity and to contact the company
                prior to beginning any excavation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator demonstrated that it has mechanisms in place to
                report and address hazards introduced by third parties working
                around pipelines.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining all
                aspects of the safety program including activities related to
                third party excavation and construction activities near the
                M&amp;NP system. During interviews, Operator staff stated the
                standard practice for analyzing legal requirements consisted of
                staff participation in industry groups such as CSA and Canadian
                Energy Pipelines Association as well as monitoring of regulatory
                updates posted on relevant government websites. The Operator did
                not demonstrate that it has a formal process for the tracking of
                legal requirements for the operation and maintenance of the
                pipeline. Although regulatory requirements were reflected in the
                procedural documents, the audit identified one issue of
                particular note to the Board. The Operator did not have a
                process in place that recognized the requirement to file
                separate technical crossing guidelines for Board approval as
                required by the
                <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Crossing Regulations</em>
                (PRC) Part&nbsp;II. The Board notes that subsequent to the
                onsite portion of this audit, the guidelines were filed.

              <p>
                The Operator could not demonstrate that it has a formal process

                As noted elsewhere, crossings and related activities are
                included in the overall operations and maintenance safety
                program. As such, the evaluation of the goals, targets and
                objectives for crossing activities such as locates were

              <p>
                A review of the organizational structure and interviews
                confirmed that, based on M&amp;NP’s present facilities and level
                of activity, it has an adequate structure in place with respect
                to its Crossing Program. Records review indicated that
                crossing-related responsibilities were incorporated in job
                descriptions across the organization where required.
              </p>
              <p>
                M&amp;NP facilities are located in Eastern Canada (Nova Scotia
                and New Brunswick). There is an Area Manager with
                responsibilities for both provinces and each province has field
                staff, a District Manager and a Lands, Emergency Preparedness
                and Public Awareness Coordinator.
              </p>
              <p>
                Field technical staff that perform crossing-related duties such
                as locates and the supervision of third party crossings, etc.
                report to the provincial District Managers. The Operation
                Technicians are cross trained to address tasks involved in
                operating and maintaining the pipeline as well as some crossing
                matters. For example, technical staff are onsite for all work
                being done within 5&nbsp;metres. Field staff indicated that
                complex crossings near the pipeline, or those crossings
                requiring a heavy equipment assessment, are escalated to the
                Coordinators and the engineers in Halifax and/or Waltham in
                order to ensure appropriate technical review. The Coordinator in
                each province reports to and takes direction from the Manager,
                right-of-way (RoW) Division, East RoW in Head Office (Waltham,
                MA). The current structure and reporting relationships are well
                understood by field staff. Interviews confirmed that there is a
                clear definition of roles and responsibilities in the Crossing
                Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit, an area of potential concern was noted with
                respect to adequacy of resourcing of the Coordinators’
                positions. The Coordinators, while managing the Awareness,
                Emergency Response and Land Matters Programs, also have
                significant responsibilities for crossing-related activities. It
                was identified during the audit that there is a small number of
                staff in each office performing multi-task roles and the
                staffing level is currently effective due to the large number of
                long-term staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if circumstances change such as an increase in staff
                turnover or in crossing activities, the Operator may not be able
                to remain effective in carrying out its Crossing Program. It is
                recommended that the Operator review the organizational
                structure and responsibilities related to the Crossing Program
                to maintain a compliant level of effectiveness.

              <p>
                However, the Board could not verify that there was a fully

                Crossing related activities such as locating and post-activity
                inspections are performed by Coordinators and operations
                technical staff as part of their routine duties. The majority of
                the Operator’s staff are long-term employees who have been
                trained to these activities during their tenure and on an
                “as-required” or “as-available” basis. For example, training on
                the pipeline locate equipment has been provided in this manner
                by the vendor. Also, the Operator utilizes mentor-based training
                for its new and existing employees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Document review confirmed that training for the field staff is
                being managed. Hard copies of training records are maintained by
                the administrator in the regional offices and electronic
                versions are managed at an offsite location (Houston, Texas).
                Managers and employees receive electronic notifications when
                select training is due to be renewed. There is an annual

                the Board was unable to review a formally established training
                program for staff performing crossing activities. However,
                interviews with senior staff indicated that the Operator is
                developing a matrix establishing training and qualifications
                requirements for application to its technical staff. As well, in
                response to the recent hiring, management developed a list of
                core training required for any new technical level field staff.
                This list will serve as an initial inventory of training needs
                for all field staff and help populate the matrix described
                above.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company has a process to ensure its contractors have the
                appropriate competencies in completing its crossing related
                activities. It was noted that the Operator has a list of
                pre-approved contractors to perform duties such as crossings and
                integrity digs. These contractors are evaluated upon completion
                of each contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was unable to demonstrate that training
                requirements for the Coordinator roles had been formally
                included in its training program. These positions have evolved
                to include tasks with varying degrees of technical knowledge
                required and training has been provided on an ongoing basis.
                However, senior staff indicated that there are no succession
                plans in place or skill inventories developed to identify the
                training requirements for the Coordinator positions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Operator has established training requirements, the
                management of training records and the communication of renewal
                notices for crossing related duties for technical staff, it was
                not able to demonstrate that there is a formal matrix. In order
                to ensure Coordinators maintain the appropriate training in the
                future, and that the training needs for staff at that level are
                documented, it is recommended that the Operator formally
                identify, document and incorporate the training needs of the
                Coordinators into the training program.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining all
                aspects of the safety program including activities related to
                third party excavation and construction activities near the
                M&amp;NP system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Internal communication takes place through regular face-to-face
                meetings as well as frequent phone conversations and
                consultations since field staff cover large areas. Each company
                truck is equipped with communication equipment such as satellite
                phones to ensure that staff are able to remain in contact at all
                times.
              </p>
              <p>
                For external stakeholders, M&amp;NP maintains a company website
                as one way to effectively communicate regarding living and
                working safely around its pipeline. At the time of the audit,
                the M&amp;NP site contained adequate information regarding the
                process for contacting the company, the circumstances under
                which it is required to do so, as well as the process for
                obtaining permission to work around its pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although there are several internal and external mechanisms in
                place for communicating third party related activities, the
                Operator could not demonstrate that there is a formalized and
                implemented communication plan that outlines the distribution of
                various types of information to appropriate parties. While
                interviews confirmed communication is occurring throughout
                technical networks and through the means identified above,
                without a formal communication plan, the Operator cannot ensure
                that all stakeholders and interested parties are receiving the
                appropriate information in a timely fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has adequate
                communication processes regarding crossing related information.
                However, the Board recommends that information related to third
                party activities be included in a formalized communication plan.

                should be revised immediately where changes are required as a
                result of legal requirements or where failure to make immediate
                changes may result in negative consequences. The company should
                have procedures within its management and protection programs to
                control documentation and data as it relates to the risks
                identified in element&nbsp;2.0.

              <p>
                The Operator staff follows the procedures and processes
                documented in the M&amp;NP O&amp;M Manual and well as Spectra
                Energy Transmission (SET) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
                Revision logs in each of the procedures confirm that these
                procedures are periodically reviewed and revisions are signed
                off by Management. The Operator’s administrative staff manages
                the majority of the crossing related information in each
                regional office. For procedures, there is a document revision
                list to manage all the changes to any of the procedures.
                Technical staff complete a request for revision form to track
                and record all requests and subsequent changes to procedures.
                The revision date is on the front of the procedure. Once
                approved and revised, the procedures are posted on the intranet
                by the administrative staff and the outdated versions are
                removed. The administrative staff also control and document the
                distribution of its as-built plans as part of the crossing
                application file.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is currently an initiative that is automating the
                maintenance of procedures. Operational Technicians are
                participating in an SET SOP harmonization project with the U.S.
                office using “Veriforce” software. Changes to procedures are
                evaluated by staff. Once approved they are integrated and
                communicated to applicable employees. The system alerts other
                staff that there has been a change to a process or procedure and
                the system ensures that each employee signs off verifying that
                they have acknowledged the change.

                aspects of the safety program including activities related to
                third party excavation and construction activities near the
                M&amp;NP system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The M&amp;NP RoW goes through both urban and rural settings and
                so there are several types of projects that take place nearby.
                Those parties who have an activity that meets the legal and
                company criteria for requiring permission to build or excavate,
                normally do so by contacting the company directly. Requests made
                through the 1-888 number, are initially received by the
                administrative staff and then technical staff evaluate them for
                what level of follow-up is required. In New Brunswick, some
                requests for permission come through the Saint John Digline
                (one-call centre). Digline forwards all requests for locates
                within 500&nbsp;metres as well as a daily report of all requests
                that were given the “all clear” because they were beyond
                500&nbsp;metres. Requests between 200-500&nbsp;metres are
                cleared at the office and those under 200&nbsp;metres are
                reviewed by field technicians. The technicians do locates for
                any request between&nbsp;5 and 10&nbsp;metres from the RoW and
                they are present for any excavation activity within
                5&nbsp;metres. Within 3&nbsp;metres, the Coordinators typically
                observe the construction or excavation activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Normal operations for crossings-related duties are described in
                the O&amp;M Manual. The Coordinators for each province address
                the more complex crossings with support from the engineers in
                the Halifax, NS or Waltham, MA office. In cooperation with the
                senior staff such as the Area Manager, operational staff
                indicated a high level of involvement in the maintenance and
                enhancement of the procedures. Operational staff in the field
                offices are long term staff and the majority of them have been
                with the company since the pipeline was being built or shortly
                thereafter. As the teams consist of cross-trained experienced
                technicians, they perform many of the front line duties
                regarding crossings, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Conducting pre-job meetings;</li>
                <li>
                  Attending all crossing installations on the RoW and within
                  5&nbsp;metres and completing the pipeline inspection reports;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performing visual analysis to identify anomalies in the
                  coating such as corrosion which would be referred to Head
                  Office for review; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Meeting with third parties and performing pipeline locates.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has documented
                procedures that address processes for normal operating
                conditions. Interviews and document review confirm that
                Operations staff follows the O&amp;M Manual for addressing
                normal hazards related to crossings.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining all
                aspects of the safety program including activities related to
                third party excavation and construction activities near the
                M&amp;NP system. The Operator’s inspection procedures dictate
                that inspection-related duties are to be performed by technical
                field staff. For example, if the pipeline is exposed, field
                staff conduct inspections of the pipeline to document the
                condition, take pictures and check for anomalies. Also, these
                staff conduct surveillance and monitoring of the M&amp;NP system
                by various means. The urban sections of the M&amp;NP line are
                driven by technical staff once a week. Staff indicated that they
                are aware of the conditions and situations that need to be noted
                in the reports, such as signage issues and evidence of
                unauthorized activity. The entire RoW is flown weekly by a
                fixed-wing plane. Interviews with the pilot confirmed there are
                procedures and training pertaining to the crossing-related
                issues that should be reported (i.e., activity or equipment on
                the RoW). Air patrol was aware of the reporting procedure which
                requires that patrols are documented and any issues are reported
                to the regional office to ensure they are investigated. The
                weekly aerial inspection reports are reviewed and then filed at
                the regional offices. M&amp;NP staff also drive the RoW on an
                all-terrain vehicle once a year to assess its condition and
                repair any signage that has been damaged. Examples of the
                different patrol reports were reviewed as part of the audit.
              </p>
              <p>
                For situations where encroachments such as fences were installed
                on the RoW without permission, they were removed. In cases where
                they have been allowed to remain, record review indicates that
                permitted encroachments are recorded. In order to ensure
                compliance with the PCR, Part&nbsp;II section&nbsp;15, all
                facilities permitted to be installed on the RoW must be
                inspected to ensure “<em>any deterioration has been detected</em
                >.” As the pipeline is approaching its second decade of
                operation, any facilities that were permitted on the RoW should
                be inspected to ensure that they are being maintained and not
                posing a threat to the safety of the pipeline. In addition, in
                order to ensure compliance with the PCR, Part&nbsp;II
                section&nbsp;15, the SOP needs to address the requirement that
                all facilities permitted to be installed on the RoW be inspected
                to ensure any deterioration has been detected.

                Although the Board was able to verify that various aspects of
                the surveillance and monitoring program were implemented as
                designed, the Operator did not demonstrate that it has developed
                and implemented surveillance and monitoring programs that
                address all legal requirements.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining all
                aspects of the safety program including activities related to
                third party excavation and construction activities near the

              <p>
                The criteria for non-compliance are described in the PCR and the
                Operator has incorporated those requirements in its procedures.
                According to field staff, there are few incidents of
                unauthorized activity on the M&amp;NP RoW with the majority of
                the issues identified in the urban centres. Technical staff have
                had to intervene and shut down companies who were working on the
                RoW without a crossing agreement. Staff assert that the
                offenders receive awareness information. According to staff, if
                the activity meets the criteria for a simple crossing, field
                technicians follow the onsite approval process as presented in
                the <em>M&amp;NP Facility Crossing Guidelines</em>. If the
                investigation of unauthorized activity is on the RoW or in the
                safety zone, follow-up consists of an informal discussion and
                awareness material is provided to the offender regarding the
                regulatory requirements and safety issues. In some cases,
                Operations technical staff gave onsite approvals for
                unauthorized activity without immediately notifying the
                Coordinator. Some field staff were unaware of the requirement to
                report each occurrence of unauthorized activity to the NEB. The
                Board concluded that the reporting of unauthorized activity has
                not been done in accordance with the PCRs or the M&amp;NP
                policy. Although identified as a requirement in the NEB PCR
                Part&nbsp;II section&nbsp;13 as well as
                <em>M&amp;NP’s Facility Crossing Guidelines</em>, the Operator’s
                staff are not reporting all unauthorized activities to the NEB
                or to their Coordinator.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator did not demonstrate that it has implemented its
                process for reporting unauthorized activity as per its
                Guidelines and the expectations for this element.

                management and protection programs are retained, accessible and
                maintained. The company shall, as a minimum, retain all records
                for the minimum lengths of time as required by the applicable
                legislation, regulation and standards incorporated by reference
                into the regulation.

                The Operator manages its crossing-related files at the regional
                offices. Onsite document review confirmed that records for
                locates, including the locate requests that received the “all
                clear” when it was determined that no locate was necessary, as
                well as crossings and related inspection reports are kept in the
                regional offices and maintained for the life of the pipeline.
                The Coordinators maintain complex crossing files and any
                subsequent reports or correspondence in the office for the life
                of the pipeline. Other records such as the aerial and ground RoW
                patrol reports are maintained in hard copy in the regional
                offices. As-builts are tracked as requested and distributed
                during the crossings application and design phase as part of
                records control to ensure that they are aware of who has a map
                of the system and why.

                Integrity Logging and initiate the maintenance requests based on
                a manufacturer recommended schedule. Documents reviewed on site
                such as the certificates of calibration confirm this process is
                being implemented as described.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has a process in

                and integrity. However, it did not mention that the PCR
                requirements were included in the protocols. Therefore, although
                some of the activities would have been reviewed under the IMP
                audit, PCR-specific requirements were not included. Activities
                related to third party excavation and construction activities
                form an integral part of each of those programs as the outcome
                of an interaction with third parties could potentially affect
                the safety of the public or personnel, environmental protection,
                and/or integrity of the pipeline.

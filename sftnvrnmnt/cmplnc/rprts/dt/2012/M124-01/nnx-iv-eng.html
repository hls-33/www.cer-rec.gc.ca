                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company shall have a policy

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                M&amp;NP’s Operator demonstrated that it has an Emergency
                Management (EM) policy in place that is well communicated
                throughout the company. Interviews conducted with Field
                Technicians, the District Manager and Lands and Public Awareness
                Coordinators (Coordinators) verified that all are well aware of
                the EM policy. They noted that the policy is reinforced at least
                annually and that management is open and accessible for direct
                feedback on policy matters from all levels of the company. The
                EM policy is contained within a document titled:
                <em
                  >Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline Emergency Preparedness and
                  Response Program</em
                >
                updated May&nbsp;2010.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews with Field Technicians, the District Manager, the
                Area Manager and Coordinators verified that management is
                committed to and fully supports the Emergency Preparedness and
                Response (EPR) Program. Monthly safety meetings allow all staff
                to raise issues and provide management feedback, and upward
                feedback and involvement is encouraged. Feedback and action
                items are recorded at every meeting to ensure they are addressed
                and tracked. The Field Technicians are also very involved with
                the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) harmonization project.
                Management has provided the budget to support the EPR Program
                including the cost of conducting exercises and purchasing new
                equipment as required. Personnel interviewed indicated that
                there has been no lack of budget support for the EM programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on interviews and documents reviewed, the Board verified
                that the Operator has formally endorsed its EPR Policy and that
                the commitment to managing its hazards and risks is evident at
                all levels within the organization.

                emergency management and protection programs (management and
                protection programs). The company should be able to implement
                control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.

                and maintaining the EPR Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the design phase of each pipeline in the M&amp;NP system, the
                Operator conducts thermal radiation simulations to determine the
                appropriate emergency planning zones (EPZs) for the pipeline.
                The EPR Program summarizes the EPZ for each pipeline in the
                M&amp;NP system and the Emergency Response Plan (ERP)
                establishes response procedures for emergencies within the EPZs.
                On an annual basis, the Operator holds an EPR meeting of the
                Area Managers, District Managers and Coordinators for the
                purposes of reviewing EPR matters and for planning EPR
                activities. The EPZs form the basis for design of the ERP. A
                review of the existing hazards and appropriateness of the EPZs
                for each of the M&amp;NP pipelines is on the agenda for this
                annual meeting. If any pipeline operating parameters change, the
                Operator recalculates the EPZ.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator’s personnel described the process for annual review
                of hazards and risks. Minutes of the annual meeting confirmed
                that a risk assessment was conducted in terms of operational
                changes and the potential changes to pipeline EPZs and training.
                The Operator described the Encana Deep Panuke project as an
                example. The Deep Panuke project would deliver sour gas to the
                Goldborough gas plant where it would be sweetened before
                transmission on the M&amp;NP mainline. The potential exists for
                a process upset at Goldborough that would result in sour gas
                being released into the M&amp;NP mainline. This hazard was
                assessed and it was determined that H<sub>2</sub>S training
                would be provided to appropriate technicians. Following the
                review of the minutes of the annual meeting, the Board could not
                confirm that there was a process in place to conduct a periodic
                review of existing hazards or to identify and incorporate new
                ones.
              </p>

                The <em>Environment Health and Safety</em> (EHS)
                <em>Management System</em> (MS)
                <em>Performance Standard 2.0 EHS Risk Management</em> sets out
                the procedure for identifying hazards, assessing hazards,
                determining levels of risk posed by the hazards and controls to
                mitigate the risks. The performance standard identifies a wide
                range of environment, health and safety hazards that could pose
                risks to people and environmental end points. An Operational
                Controls Table is used to maintain an inventory of this
                information according to activity, identified hazard, assessment
                of risk, reference to legal requirements and established
                controls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Procedures were developed based on the requirements set out in
                Performance Standard 2.0 for assessing the primary hazards posed
                by the M&amp;NP pipeline system, such as conducting thermal
                radiation simulations in order to determine the EPZs, and
                conducting an annual review of the hazards and risks. However,
                it could not be verified that these procedures met the intent of
                this Performance Standard in that all possible hazards to the
                public, responders, property and the environment had been
                identified, and that the level of risk posed by each hazard, the
                risk ranking and appropriate control measures for the purpose of
                emergency response planning had been determined.
              </p>
              <p>
                It could not be demonstrated that the Operator has appropriately
                implemented its process for identifying hazards and determining
                appropriate control measures for emergency response planning.

                The EPR Program includes a process to identify and integrate
                legal requirements. The applicable sections of the OPR-99
                related to EM are integrated into the EPR program. The Operator
                updates the ERP on an annual basis and files copies of the
                updates with the NEB in accordance with its document control
                procedures. The ERP identifies National Energy Board (NEB or the

                The Manager of Regulatory Affairs described the process that is
                in place to monitor regulatory changes. The governing
                legislation, regulations, standards, advisories and other
                applicable regulatory information is tracked, any changes or
                updates undergo strategic analysis to identify business impacts
                and required operational changes and then action plans are
                developed and implemented. All regulatory changes are captured
                and an annual summary of regulatory changes is broadly
                distributed throughout the company. Examples of changes being
                tracked are the proposed damage prevention regulations and the
                NEB pipeline abandonment initiatives.

                Operator staff informs visitors to company maintenance sites of
                the practices and procedures to be followed. At each office or
                field location visited, the auditors were signed-in to the site,
                given a site orientation, and informed of the safety and
                emergency procedures to be followed in the event of an
                emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interviews verified that all personnel who have an emergency
                response role receive appropriate levels of training for their
                respective roles in accordance with the
                <em>EHS MS Performance Standard 1.4 EHS Training</em> and the
                EPR Program. In addition, all field technicians and other
                personnel receive core safety training. While the field
                technicians are not provided specific emergency management
                training such as Incident Command System or Emergency Site
                Management, they receive training in company emergency response
                procedures, as well as plan and participate in several emergency
                response exercises per year, including at least six table top
                exercises and one full scale mock emergency exercise. Company
                personnel rotate through exercise roles such as incident
                commander, on-site supervisor, safety officer and liaison
                officer in order that training and response capability are
                maximized. In addition to participating in exercises, the
                Coordinators and district and area managers receive additional
                training in incident command and emergency operations centre
                management from both the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick EMO. Upon
                completion of this training, company employees complete written
                examinations. Examination of training records for field
                technicians verified participation in emergency response
                exercises. The hard copy training records of all employees are
                filed and tracked by administrative staff and training
                requirements are managed by the Learning Management System (LMS)
                that tracks training completion and generates an e-mail to the
                employee and his or her manager when training is due. Field
                technicians noted that, although there is not a field operator
                qualification procedure in place for M&amp;NP, the company is
                developing a field operator qualification procedure.

                A field technician described the response taken to a cargo plane
                crash at the Halifax Airport, and credits the skills gained from
                company exercises with the success in dealing this real
                emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the Operator’s continuing education and liaison program,
                first responders such as fire departments, police and emergency
                health services, the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia EMOs,
                pre-qualified contractors, the public, and other persons who may
                be involved in an emergency on the M&amp;NP system receive
                training as required for their respective roles. Documents
                reviewed verified that the continuing education forums and
                emergency response exercises are very well attended by all of
                these groups, and that the forums and exercises are conducted
                several times per year according to a well planned and managed
                schedule. All participants sign-in to the exercises and
                participation is tracked. The most recent full scale mock
                exercise conducted by the Operator involved almost 70
                participants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on interviews and documents reviewed, the Operator
                demonstrated that personnel receive adequate training in
                emergency response.

              <p>
                The Operator has a documented continuing education and liaison
                program in place to educate the public, first responders and
                contractors that may have a role during an emergency on the
                M&amp;NP pipeline. Document review verified the content of
                information provided to stakeholders, including information on
                pipeline safety, emergency preparedness, what to do if there is
                a suspected pipeline emergency and company contact information.
                Communication tools include the mailing of annual information
                letters to all residents within the EPZs and, where requested,
                meetings with residents to discuss the information brochures;
                First Responder booklets; presentations to first responders,
                forestry operators, landowners and municipalities; video
                presentations; personal visits to landowners; and public
                awareness presentations. The Board also reviewed the Public
                Awareness binders where activities and schedules of engagement
                events are tracked.

                Accu-link call system is a 24-hour call system reached through a
                1-800 number that is on the M&amp;NP signs and website. The
                Accu-link centre will manage any call received by the Operator
                for any reason. In the event of a phone call to report a
                potential pipeline emergency, the Accu-link centre records
                essential information on the nature of the emergency, caller
                contact information, location of the caller and location of the
                potential emergency. The call is immediately referred to the
                Operator’s on-call duty officer and an electronic ticket is
                generated. The Accu-link system also receives calls related to
                line locate requests and work proposed on the M&amp;NP
                Right-of-Way (RoW). For any work proposed within 500&nbsp;meters
                of the RoW the caller is referred to the Operator for review and
                approval of the work. The call system was tested as part of the
                audit during non-business hours which confirmed the system
                worked well. The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has
                communication processes to inform all persons associated with
                its facilities and activities of its EPR Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although there are several internal and external mechanisms in
                place for communicating EPR Program related information, the
                Operator could not demonstrate that there is a formalized and
                implemented communication plan that outlines the distribution of
                various types of information to appropriate parties. While
                interviews confirmed communication is occurring throughout
                technical networks and through the means identified above,
                without a formal communication plan, the Operator cannot ensure
                that all stakeholders and interested parties are receiving the
                appropriate information in a timely fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has adequate
                communication processes regarding EPR Program information. The
                Board recommends that information related to the third party
                activities be included in a formalized communication plan.

                The EPR Program Manual describes the elements of the EM program.
                The EPR Program Manual is reviewed and revised as necessary
                through the annual management review process. Documents such as
                the ERP Manual and emergency response mapping are also
                controlled and distributed to appropriate agencies and First
                Responders that may have a role in an emergency. Urban and rural

                The Field ERP sets out the company response procedures in the
                event of a pipeline emergency on the M&amp;NP system in New
                Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The document is current to
                February&nbsp;2007 and in accordance with the EPR Program, it
                undergoes management review on an annual basis. Review of the
                minutes of the annual meeting confirmed that the ERP is a
                standing agenda item for the annual review. The ERP contains the
                appropriate sections and content to enable the Operator to deal
                with an emergency, including but not limited to: levels of
                alert; response team structure; mutual aid; command posts;

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EPR
                Program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator has an ERP in place for the operation of the
                M&amp;NP pipeline systems in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The
                ERP includes appropriate roles, equipment, procedures, etc. for
                the hazards identified. The ERP Manual is updated annually, with
                version and distribution control processes applied and followed.
                The ERP Manual and any updates are filed with NEB.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator conducts full scale mock and table top exercises on
                a scheduled basis to train company personnel and test first
                responders and contractors. The Operator regularly informs the
                public, agencies and first responders (fire departments, police
                and Emergency Health Services) about the locations of its
                pipelines and facilities, the hazards associated with its
                pipeline system, the procedures to follow in the event of an
                emergency, and the names and contact numbers of the company in
                order to report any suspected or actual pipeline emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator has a documented incident reporting procedure and
                conducts debriefing sessions upon completion of exercises in
                order to review and learn, and revise the EPR Program as
                required.

                quantitative measures for evaluating the management and
                protection programs and should, at a minimum, address legal
                requirements as well as the risks identified as significant in
                elements&nbsp;2.0 and&nbsp;3.0. The company should integrate the

                assessments and performance measures, including proactive trend
                analyses. The company shall have documentation and records of
                its surveillance and monitoring programs.

                The company shall have a process to mitigate any potential or

                Such mitigation may include appropriate timing and actions for

                sets out the detailed incident investigation procedures.
                Document review confirmed that the Operator has standard

                The Operator conducts several exercises per year including table
                top and full scale mock exercises. There is documentation that
                supports the planning and implementation phases of the
                exercises. However, documentation is absent that shows the
                feedback received from participants in the exercises, the
                lessons learned from the exercises and the actions put in place
                to address suggested improvements and for incorporating feedback
                into the EPR Program. There is no documentation demonstrating

                The Operator did not demonstrate that it has a process for

                from the lessons learned in its table top and full scale
                emergency response exercises and therefore does not have

                its protection programs and procedures.

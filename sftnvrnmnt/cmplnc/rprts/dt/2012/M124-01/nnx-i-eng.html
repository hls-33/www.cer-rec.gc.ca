                The Operator applies Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline’s
                (M&amp;NP) Integrity Management Program (IMP) document, dated
                31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2010 which includes Section&nbsp;2: Corporate
                Policies, Objectives, and Organization. Subsection&nbsp;2.1
                contains a Policy and Objectives description of short term
                (1-4&nbsp;year) and long term (5-10&nbsp;year) plans for all
                integrity related program developments, including hazard
                identification, inspection and investigation and maintenance
                activities for all pipelines within the scope of the document.
                The IMP Policy is endorsed and approved by senior management. In
                addition, there is the Pipeline Integrity Oversight Committee
                (PIOC) with a mandate to administer the IMP for all Canadian
                regulated pipelines. PIOC committee members are comprised of
                senior management including: Director, Pipeline Integrity
                (Houston); Manager, Pipeline Design (Houston); Manager,
                Metallurgical Services (Houston); Director, Operations
                Compliance (Houston); Director, Facilities Operations (Houston);
                Director, Technical Operations (Southeast Region); and Director,
                Technical Operations (Northeast Region).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews conducted, the
                Operator was able to demonstrate that it has a policy which
                commits to continual improvement and is communicated throughout
                the organization.

                emergency management and protection programs (management and
                protection programs). The company should be able to implement
                control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.

                IMP document, summarizes the hazards that are considered to be
                relevant to its operations. The identified hazards are used as
                input for a commercial risk assessment software program (<strong

                >) offered and administrated by Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems,
                Inc. M&amp;NP has segmented its pipeline system into logical and
                logistical segments (valve to pressure reducing station (PRS)
                and PRS to end of line valve). This dynamic segmentation allows
                M&amp;NP to calculate the risk values of individual segments and
                compare the overall risk of one segment to another. The hazards
                input into the program include: internal corrosion, external
                corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, manufacturing,
                construction, equipment, and weather-related and outside forces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Section&nbsp;8.3.2: Internal Corrosion of the IMP states that
                “All the natural gas pipeline systems operated by the Company
                are designed as dry gas systems and are monitored and maintained
                to prevent internal corrosion as described in the Company’s
                procedures. Thus internal corrosion is not considered a viable
                threat to the Company pipeline system at the current time.”
              </p>
              <p>
                However, there was evidence based on in-line inspections (ILI)
                conducted in the past, that although the pipelines carry dry gas
                (5-7#/MMSCF) and are monitored for water and other potential
                corrodents, some pipelines had indications of internal
                anomalies. These pipelines included: Saint John PRS to Irving
                Refinery and the Saint John rural laterals, Point Tupper Lateral
                and the Moncton Lateral. Potentially, the most serious of these
                anomalies was in the Point Tupper Lateral with an ILI vendor
                call of 30% internal metal loss that was subsequently excavated
                and determined to be 23% internal metal loss. The Pipe and
                Coating Inspection Report (Form 7T-33AW dated 05/20/2009)
                indicated that “The anomaly assessed was an internal
                factory/manufacturer metal loss defect” and that moisture and
                the presence of corrodents was not a contributing factor to the
                internal corrosion identified. Regardless, M&amp;NP assessed the
                anomaly using Modified B31G, Effective Area Method and the B31G
                method to determine the safe operating pressure as compared to
                the actual operating pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the <strong><em>RiskAnalyst</em></strong> software
                produced internal corrosion output values that varied
                from&nbsp;0.09 on the Moncton Lateral to&nbsp;1.68 on
                Line&nbsp;10 (Mainline). These values are on a scale of&nbsp;1
                to&nbsp;10. Initially, these values were of concern as they
                represent a likelihood of failure due to internal corrosion.
                Upon examination of the Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems, Inc.
                algorithm in the IMP Section&nbsp;2.4 Internal Corrosion, it was
                determined that the output values are a summary of all segments
                and of all algorithm outputs. While a detailed breakdown of
                individual segment and algorithm output values was not obtained,
                interviewees indicated that the scores resulted primarily from
                the Mitigation Multiplication Factor which uses the elapsed time
                since the last ILI, hydrostatic test or Internal Corrosion
                Direct Assessment. Thus, the numbers resulting from the software
                do not strictly represent a mechanistic probability of internal
                corrosion due to the presence of free water, acid gas (carbon
                dioxide/hydrogen sulfide) or microbiologically influenced
                corrosion. With respect to the software internal corrosion
                values that had a maximum of&nbsp;1.68, this value is in the
                lower region of the corporate risk assessment matrix
                (Section&nbsp;9: Risk Assessment, Figure&nbsp;4: Risk Matrix)
                which has values bounded by&nbsp;0.00 to&nbsp;1.99. Thus the
                Operator considers the risk due to internal corrosion to be
                minimal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The integrity management team has recognized the possibility of
                internal corrosion and has committed to implement a corrosion
                control program on all pipelines. The program would follow
                Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Volume&nbsp;2 - Corrosion,
                2-3010 Internal Corrosion Monitoring and Mitigation which
                includes maintenance pigging and analysis of any deposits
                resulting from the pipeline pigging. The pigging program would
                have a targeted frequency of twice per year per pipeline
                segment, but ultimately the frequency for each pipeline would be
                assessment based. The integrity management team also indicated
                that, during the harmonization and revision of the IMP document,
                Section&nbsp;8.3.2 Internal Corrosion would be revised from
                “internal corrosion is not considered a viable threat” to
                reflect that there is some evidence that internal corrosion
                should be considered, and thus mitigated. Based on the evidence
                presented to the Board during the audit, the Board is of the
                opinion that internal corrosion will be appropriately monitored
                and mitigated.

                The IMP, Section&nbsp;6: Management of Change (MOC) addresses
                the requirements for the IMP and is intended to cover physical,
                procedural, technical and organizational changes that may impact
                the pipeline system. The MOC process describes in detail the
                types of changes that could be of impact to the pipeline system
                as well as the critical elements of change management.
                Section&nbsp;6.3.1 of the IMP documents the MOC roles and
                responsibilities within the organization from a functional
                standpoint and includes an MOC process flow diagram describing

                The IMP, Section&nbsp;5: Competency and Training recognizes the
                increasingly complex nature of pipeline systems and the
                associated maintenance, inspection and monitoring requirements.
                The Operator also recognizes the need for personnel involved in
                the pipeline integrity program to possess highly specialized
                skills and that staff will be required to demonstrate competence
                in the areas for which they are responsible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator has classified personnel involved in the planning
                and execution of the IMP into General Service Providers and
                Critical Service Providers. The former consists of personnel
                involved in general activities and the latter consists of
                personnel involved in the execution of specialized pipeline
                inspection and maintenance activities. Technical competency
                requirements for both groups are based on an analysis of an
                individual’s present or expected involvement in basic or
                advanced aspects of the IMP activities. Following the analysis
                and assessment of basic training needs, the design and planning
                of training is conducted regularly, with training sessions
                scheduled no less than annually.
              </p>
              <p>
                Training and qualifications for Critical Service Providers
                includes Operator staff, vendors and contractors. These training
                requirements include: ILI, engineering and risk assessments,
                non-destructive testing, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and
                corrosion investigations, mechanical or materials defect
                assessments, pipeline defect repair, field recoating, hot
                tapping and maintenance welding. Where industry standards or
                certification are an applicable aspect in the qualification and
                evaluation of competency, the Operator includes these
                requirements for staff or contract personnel. Among these
                designations are: Professional Engineering Associations,
                Certified Engineering Technicians/Technologists, Non-Destructive
                Examination (NDE) service providers having CGSB Level&nbsp;II
                or&nbsp;III in MPI, UT or radiography and SCC.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator’s management who are responsible for the IMP are
                required to provide relevant support for both the trainers and
                trainees with respect to equipment, software and opportunities
                to exercise the competencies. The audit program as outlined in
                Section&nbsp;15.4 of the IMP ensures that the effectiveness of
                the training program and the objectives and expectations of the
                training program are being achieved. Documents and records of
                the completed training program for all staff are maintained in
                the local area offices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews, the Operator was
                able to demonstrate that it has a training program for its staff
                and contractors as it relates to its IMP.

                The IMP includes sections that document relevant aspects of its
                integrity programs. Examples of the most relevant of these to
                communication are: Section&nbsp;1: IMP Scope; Section&nbsp;2:
                Corporate Policies, Objectives and Organization;
                Subsection&nbsp;2.2.2.6 Administrative/Technical/Regulatory
                Document Teams with eight tables outlining the functional roles
                and responsibilities; Subsection&nbsp;2.3.2 Performance
                Measures; Section&nbsp;3: Documentation and Information Methods;
                and Section&nbsp;6: Management of Change Plan which includes
                Table&nbsp;2: Responsibilities for Providing Approvals for
                Change and Section&nbsp;11: Integrity Management Program
                Planning.
              </p>
              <p>
                The IMP document, in addition to the SOP’s, provides sufficient
                detail to support the effective implementation of the IMP
                elements as well as ensuring that the inspection, measurement,
                monitoring and maintenance activities are conducted in
                accordance with the Operator’s specifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews conducted, the
                Operator was able to demonstrate that it has effective
                communication to inform all interested persons of activities
                related to its IMP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although there are several internal and external mechanisms in
                place for communicating integrity issues, the Operator could not
                demonstrate that there is a formalized and implemented
                communication plan that outlines the distribution of various
                types of information to appropriate parties. While interviews
                confirmed communication is occurring throughout technical
                networks and through the means identified above, without a
                formal communication plan, the Operator cannot ensure that all
                stakeholders and interested parties are receiving the
                appropriate information in a timely fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has adequate
                communication processes regarding integrity related information.
                The Board recommends that information related to the integrity
                of the system be included in a formalized communication plan.

                The Operator has recognized pigging as a hazard in its O&amp;MSM
                (Section&nbsp;04: Cleaning, Testing and Purging,
                Reference&nbsp;05: Pipeline Pigging - General) where it clearly
                states that “Pigging is extremely dangerous when done
                incorrectly.” Item #3 in this document states “The pigging
                barrel is a pressure vessel. Operations involving opening of the
                door should be done with extreme care as the energy stored in
                high-pressure gas is sufficient to tear the door off its hinges
                and launch a pig out of the barrel at high velocity. Assurance
                that the barrel is fully vented is the pigging crew’s
                responsibility and is a major factor to their personal safety.”
              </p>
              <p>
                SOP, Volume&nbsp;1 - Pipeline, Procedure Number&nbsp;1-5030
                states “The following procedures for running pigs demonstrate
                general practices only; operating personnel shall develop and
                implement site specific procedures and thoroughly familiarize
                themselves with the requirements of these procedures prior to
                their use and operation.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The site specific Cleaning Pig Procedure for the Halifax Lateral
                - Rural Section dated August&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2008 contains a
                detailed checklist procedure for launching and receiving pigs.
                The steps to be taken for receiving the pig are on pages&nbsp;13
                to&nbsp;16 of this Pig Procedure. The labels given to some of
                the facilities (12” valving location, 2” pressure gauge access
                valves) referenced in the procedure are not accurately
                identified on the schematic. Also, the Nova Scotia Halifax
                Lateral schematic reviewed (PLDM&amp;NCAN05.0) did not align
                with the rural pigging facilities (B-0708-4C) as built. A site
                tour of the Halifax rural receiver and urban launcher confirmed
                that the pigging facilities as constructed do not match the
                existing schematics. The type and location of these facilities
                could have significant impact on the procedures and ultimately
                the safety of operators performing the procedures, thereby
                necessitating accurate and current schematics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Draft Audit Report referred to “P&amp;IDs (process and
                instrumentation drawings). In response to the Draft Audit
                Report, M&amp;NP clarified that P&amp;IDs are the original
                construction documents and thus may not be consistent with the
                current facility schematics and field labels. However, Board
                staff were in fact reviewing the PLDs that M&amp;NP indicated
                are the official operating drawings. The nomenclature used was
                not the reason behind the finding of Non-Compliant with respect
                to this Element.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the site tour, operations and maintenance personnel
                demonstrated a clear and complete understanding of the required
                receiving procedures, including: bringing the pig into the
                oversized barrel, ensuring that the pig’s location was in the
                oversized barrel versus the standard 12” piping using a compass
                which reacts to the magnetic pig tracking insert, isolating and
                blowing down the standard size (12”) upstream piping, switching
                analog pressure gauges to digital gauges to be able to detect
                very low pressures, removing the digital gauge and probing the
                gauge valve for obstructions to ensure full depressurization and
                finally opening the receiver door to extract the pig. However,
                these details are only reflected by one step in the written
                procedure as “Verify zero pressure in Receiver barrel on both
                sides of the pig (prior to opening the closure door).” Given the
                inherent hazards associated with receiving the pig, and the
                specific procedural details tailored to the unique piping and
                valving arrangements that may exist at each receiver, site
                specific written procedures are required. Relying only on
                “on-the-job training” is not sufficient to ensure adequate and
                effective training and competency of inexperienced personnel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Review of the Pigging Training PowerPoint presentation provided
                (7/7/2010) (slides&nbsp;51 to&nbsp;58) illustrates the general
                pig receiving procedure. Every schematic contained in the
                presentation shows a pressure equalization line between the
                upstream inlet line and the oversized pig barrel. Although this
                is a desired facility design feature and is shown on the
                schematics in the employee training materials, the Halifax rural
                pig receiver does not include any such pressure equalization
                line. As well as the fact that employees are being trained on a
                procedure that relates to an equalization line that doesn’t
                currently exist, the absence of such a line increases the need
                for and importance of detailed procedures, such as indicated by
                the operations personnel during interviews, to absolutely ensure
                zero pressure on both sides of the pig.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, pipeline pigging has been limited to initial cleaning
                runs and actual ILI pigging. In the future, as a result of the
                internal corrosion program to be implemented in&nbsp;2011, more
                frequent pigging will be required on all mainlines and laterals.
                This increased exposure to operations personnel necessitates
                detailed, accurate and complete procedures for each pig launcher
                and receiver to identify site specific hazards and mitigate the
                risk associated with pipeline pigging.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator could not demonstrate that it has a process to
                identify and revise changes to documentation where failure to
                make immediate changes may result in negative consequences.

                operations for all pipeline facilities operated by the Operator.
                The communications systems are comprised of a wholly-owned and
                controlled satellite system to ensure ideal communication along
                the pipeline route. A 1-888 emergency telephone system has been
                put into place to be used by the public. The number is displayed
                on all M&amp;NP line signs, valve sites, stations and related
                facilities. An after-hours answering service receives calls and
                communicates specific needs to the appropriate Operations Center
                or on-call technician.
              </p>
              <p>
                As per CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 Clause&nbsp;10.3.2.5, the Operator has

                The Operator’s IMP, Section&nbsp;13: Inspection, Testing,
                Patrols and Monitoring outlines its procedures to conduct
                inspections, testing, patrols and monitoring in accordance with
                Clauses&nbsp;9 and&nbsp;10 of CSA&nbsp;Z662-07. The detailed
                procedures are contained in the SOPs. The SOPs have been
                “harmonized” to ensure the requirements for the U.S. and
                Canadian regulators are specified in terms of specific tasks and
                the frequencies of those tasks. The SOPs have been organized to
                address threat-specific requirements. For example, IMP
                Section&nbsp;1.6: Inspection and Damage Prevention contains ten
                (10)&nbsp;procedures covering pipeline RoW patrols and leakage
                surveys. IMP Section&nbsp;2.2: External Corrosion includes
                thirty&nbsp;(30)&nbsp;detailed procedures with the focus on
                cathodic protection inspection, testing and monitoring. Review
                of the Annual Cathodic Protection Survey Report for&nbsp;2009
                indicated that the survey scope (test points) and results (NACE
                criteria) met regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 Clause&nbsp;10.6.1.2 states that the frequency
                of pipeline patrolling shall be determined by considering such
                factors as: operating pressure, pipeline size, population
                density, etc., which are risk-based considerations. The
                Operator’s inclusion of risk-based frequencies as required by
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 is evident in SOP&nbsp;1-6010 Pipeline Patrol
                and Leakage Survey Frequency Criteria, which specifies bi-weekly
                aerial RoW patrols.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure the Operator has appropriate documentation and records
                of the inspection, surveillance and monitoring programs, each
                SOP contains links imbedded in the electronic document to the
                “Reporting” and “Forms” requirements upon completion of the SOP
                tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of data integration and analysis, IMP
                Section&nbsp;13.2: Evaluation of Inspection, Testing, Patrol and
                Monitoring Results stipulates that, upon completion of each
                task, the results are evaluated to determine whether a potential
                threat exists, and when the results indicate the presence of
                conditions that might lead to a failure incident with
                significant consequences or to an external interference
                incident, an engineering assessment is to be performed in
                accordance with CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 Clause&nbsp;10.14.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of risk assessment, IMP Section&nbsp;9.2.2: Review of
                Previous Integrity Management Processes states that information
                gained from integrity audits, performance metrics, integrity
                assessments and mitigative actions (i.e.,&nbsp;Inspection,
                Testing, Patrols and Monitoring) over the previous year will be
                incorporated into the annual updating of the risk information
                for each threat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on documents reviewed and interviews conducted, the
                Operator was able to demonstrate that it has surveillance and
                monitoring programs to address its hazards and risks as it
                relates to the IMP.

                follow-up investigation and inclusions of any recommendations to
                the IMP that would reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of such
                an incident. Section&nbsp;2.3.2: Performance Measures includes
                threatspecific incident data that would constitute
                non-compliances. The data is collected, monitored, reviewed and
                investigated by the PIOC on a semi-annual basis. An internal
                report is presented and reviewed by senior management as well as
                the integrity management staff of M&amp;NP. While no incidents
                had occurred that required action for the Operator, the annual

              <h3 id="s5"><strong>5.0 MANAGEMENT REVIEW</strong></h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Expectations:</strong> Senior management should formally
                review the management and protection programs for continuing
                suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The review should be
                based on appropriate documentation and records including the
                results of the surveillance, monitoring and audit programs. This
                review should be formal and documented and should occur on a
                regular basis. The management review should include a review of
                any decisions, actions and commitments which relate to the
                improvement of the programs and the company’s overall
                performance.

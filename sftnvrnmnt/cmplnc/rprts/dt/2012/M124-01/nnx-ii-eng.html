              <p>
                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                M&amp;NP has endorsed its Operator’s Environment, Health and
                Safety (EHS) policy, EHS Management System (MS), performance
                standards and safety action plan which outline its commitment to
                ensuring safety for personnel and the public.
              </p>
              <p>The EHS policy includes the following principles</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Accountability;</li>
                <li>Stewardship;</li>

                <li>Communication.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The EHS MS describes how employees and contractors are expected
                to meet the desired level of EHS performance for the following
                elements:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Roles, responsibilities and accountabilities;</li>
                <li>Risk management;</li>
                <li>Emergency Preparedness &amp; Response;</li>
                <li>Compliance management;</li>
                <li>Supplier, Contractor and Partner Relationships;</li>
                <li>Stewardship and community relations;</li>
                <li>Goal setting and performance measurement;</li>
                <li>Incident reporting and investigation; and</li>
                <li>Assessment and management system review.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Based on interviews and documents reviewed, the Board verified
                that M&amp;NP has formally endorsed its Operator’s EHS MS and
                that the commitment to managing its safety hazards and risks is
                demonstrated at all levels within the organization.

                company should assess the degree of risk associated with these
                hazards. The company should be able to support the rationale for
                including or excluding possible risks in regard to its
                environment, safety, integrity, crossings and awareness and
                emergency management and protection programs (management and
                protection programs). The company should be able to implement
                control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.

                <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
                As part of an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Agreement
                between M&amp;NP and its Operator, the Operator is implementing
                and maintaining the EHS MS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator incorporates a Risk Inventory and Job Safety
                Analysis (JSA) to assess EHS risk. The risk inventory method
                involves discussions with EHS, Operations, Maintenance, and
                other site personnel around specific scenarios. For each risk
                scenario, the team discusses how workers could be injured or the
                environment damaged and then they discuss and evaluate the
                adequacy of existing controls. The JSA method integrates risk
                assessment and risk control to a particular task completed in
                order to identify appropriate roles at specific locations. The
                Operator documents hazards using Job Hazard Assessments (JHA);
                Hazard Identification and Reporting forms and Job Observation
                Checklists.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator conducts risk assessment workshops annually to
                ensure the ongoing validity of identified risks and the possible
                identification of new ones. Prior to the workshop, EHS personnel
                obtain input from across the organization by interviewing a
                broad range of staff. This feedback is used as the basis for the
                workshop. These assessment workshops are designed to establish a
                forum/avenue to identify and evaluate EHS risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another element of the EHS program involves a contractor health
                and safety management performance standard. It provides guidance
                for the registration, selection and oversight of all contractors
                performing work on the M&amp;NP system and facilities.
                Implementation of the program ensures contractor safety
                expectations are met and risks are successfully managed. The
                contractor develops its H&amp;S work plans prior to the start of
                work. Management conducts a review to ensure adequate internal
                and external oversight controls are part of the project review.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that EHS hazard
                identification, risk assessments and controls are being
                conducted throughout the organization and integrated into the
                appropriate aspects of the operation.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is responsible for developing,
                implementing and maintaining the EHS MS.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the audit it was identified that the Operator has
                developed a process which includes the identification of and
                status of regulatory requirements and undertakings. An annual
                review is conducted of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to
                ensure legislated requirements are met and a gap analysis is
                conducted by the Operator’s United States (U.S.) based staff to
                determine any next steps which may be required. Additionally,
                the Operator’s Canadian EHS staff monitors Canadian Occupational
                Health and Safety (OHS) legislation and industry best practices
                with respect to any recent changes that are relevant to
                operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of the development and intent of the processes
                described above, the Operator was unable to demonstrate that its
                processes included all of the Canadian OHS legislation which
                applied. For example, it was noted during document review and
                interviews that the
                <em>Canada Labour Code Part&nbsp;II</em> (CLC Part&nbsp;II) and
                the
                <em>Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations</em>
                (COSHR) were not included in any of the reference documents,
                making it difficult to verify whether the relevant requirements
                had been identified and integrated into these documents. As
                another significant example, at the time of the audit, the
                Operator was not able to demonstrate that it has a process that
                would meet the requirement to develop and implement a “Violence
                Prevention in the Workplace” program as required by CLC
                Part&nbsp;II 125.1(z.16) and COSHR Section&nbsp;20 which came
                into effect in&nbsp;2008 (SOR/2008-148, s.&nbsp;1 Interviews
                with the Operator’s Human Resources personnel confirmed that the
                'Violence in the Workplace Policy and Program' is currently
                under development; however, as the program was in the early
                stages of development, it could not be assessed for adequacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of its comments on the Draft Audit Report, M&amp;NP
                indicated that the Manager, Regulatory Affairs is the primary
                point of contact with the NEB with regard to any compliance
                issues or changes to regulatory requirements. Upon receiving
                notification/correspondence from the NEB, the Manager,
                Regulatory Affairs forwards this information within the company
                as deemed appropriate. Safety compliance issues and identified
                gaps are tracked within the appropriate management team (lead by
                the Area Manager for operations related issues and the Project
                Manager for capital project related issues) as well as by the
                EHS Department.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator did not demonstrate that it has an effective and
                fully-implemented process to identify and integrate all
                appropriate occupational health and safety legislation into its
                Safety Program.

                <strong>Expectations:</strong> The company should have goals,

                hazards associated with the company’s facilities and activities

                and targets should be measurable and consistent with the Policy
                and legal requirements and ideally include continual improvement
                and prevention initiatives, where appropriate.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EHS
                MS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator has a system in place to identify EHS goals and
                integrate them into action plans for corporate and individual
                assessments. Action plans and objectives are set out by the Vice
                Presidents of the various divisions participating in the
                Operations Committee, EHS Committee, as well as regional
                management and staff personal safety action plans. These
                committees provide reports and updates to senior management to
                provide a clear picture of the work of the committees in
                relation to the established goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                EHS goals, targets and objectives have been identified for all
                staff and are included in individual job descriptions. The
                employees’ objectives are discussed at the beginning of the
                year, again at least once during the year and a third time at
                the end of the year when the past year’s performance is
                evaluated and objectives are established for the next year. EHS
                performance is included in the overall employee objectives and
                employees are provided recognition for meeting their EHS
                performance objectives (known as “Short Term Incentive
                Programs”).
              </p>
              <p>
                The audit identified that goals, objectives and targets, while
                managed appropriately, only marginally meet the present minimum
                requirements to be compliant and could be improved to address
                issues more relevant to M&amp;NP operations in Canada.
                Particularly, it was noted that the goals focussed on broader
                regional issues such as compression which is more relevant to
                the Northeastern (NE) United States (U.S.) facilities where the
                majority of this region’s activities are located. Presently
                there are no compression facilities in Canada; therefore, the
                goals do not fully reflect the NEB facilities and related
                activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Operator was able to demonstrate that it has set
                objectives and targets relevant to its hazards and risks
                associated with the company’s facilities and activities and has
                integrated them into individual and corporate performance
                measures, the Board recommends that these goals and targets be
                reviewed to verify their suitability to the Canadian operational
                requirements.

                As part of an O&amp;M Agreement between M&amp;NP and its
                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EHS
                MS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator has a safety training matrix for employees assigned
                to operating and maintaining the M&amp;NP pipeline. This matrix
                consists of a list of core safety training courses and the
                frequency for renewal. Employees are provided with notice and
                reminded of any updates to this matrix should additional
                training requirements be identified or should the existing
                curricula change. Also, some of the EHS training is offered
                online. The Human Resources Orientation Checklist includes all
                relevant EHS courses and managers are required to sign-off.
                Document review confirmed that training for the technical staff
                is being managed. Hard copies of training records are maintained
                by the administrator in the regional offices and electronic
                versions are managed at an offsite location (Houston, TX).
                Managers and employees receive electronic notifications when
                select training is due to be renewed. There is an annual
                evaluation on overall performance and the records are maintained
                by administrative staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has an adequate and
                effective safety training program for staff.

              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that it uses various
                methods for communicating safety requirements with its internal
                and external stakeholders. Currently, it communicates EHS
                requirements and issues with staff in the following ways:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Safety Stand Down Meetings;</li>
                <li>Quarterly Employee Meetings and Safety Updates;</li>
                <li>Daily tailgate meetings;</li>
                <li>Daily and weekly safety reports;</li>

                <li>Monthly reporting to EHS Corporate group.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Despite the many communication avenues, the Operator did not
                demonstrate that a formalized communication plan existed within
                the organization that identifies interested parties and
                pertinent information required to be communicated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although interviews confirmed communication is occurring
                throughout technical networks and through the means identified
                above, without a formal communication plan, the Operator cannot
                ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties are
                receiving the key information in a timely fashion or by an
                established and ongoing process. The informal nature of the
                communication mechanisms does not allow for the demonstration of
                ongoing adequacy of the communication taking place within the
                organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board could not verify that a formalized communication plan
                exists within the organization that clearly identifies
                interested parties and pertinent safety information that is
                required to be communicated in accordance with Board
                expectations.

                Operator, the Operator is implementing and maintaining the EHS

              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator manages safety related documents in the regional
                offices. The audit confirmed that there is a comprehensive
                document management system is in place, which includes processes
                to control and transmittal tracking of all safety program
                related documents. Review of the document control process showed
                that the system is undergoing continual improvement including
                monitoring, evaluation and updating of program documents when
                required. The Operator was able to demonstrate that it has
                adequate documentation control procedures in place to ensure the
                EHS MS provides the appropriate level of guidance to employees.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, during the document review, the Board identified
                version control issues with selected safety program documents.
                For example, CSA&nbsp;Z662-03 was referenced in procedures
                throughout the Operations and Maintenance Manual. That is not
                the most current version of that standard. However, there was no
                evidence suggesting that the outdated reference was indicative
                of a systemic issue as the Integrity Management Program Manual
                and the Emergency Preparedness Manual referenced the
                CSA&nbsp;Z662-07.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Operator was able to demonstrate that is has adequate
                documentation and controls in place to ensure that the EHS MS
                provides the appropriate level of guidance to employees. Due to
                the issue of outdated CSA references, the Board recommends that
                the Operator update the Operations and Maintenance Manual to
                reflect the current version of the CSA standard. This reference
                update ensures that users of the document can trace a
                requirement as referenced in the manual and obtain the most
                up-to-date requirements.

                During the audit, it was confirmed that the risk assessment and
                Job Hazard Assessment include various mitigating measures to
                ensure operational control is maintained. The Operator uses
                these mitigating measures to form the basis of the operational
                procedures. Spectra is working on a SOP Harmonization Project
                which is in a transition phase. The SOP Harmonization Project is

              <p>
                In the case of incident investigation, the Operator has a
                documented and comprehensive process in place which includes
                provisions for the reporting and investigation of incidents. In
                addition, the incident reporting and investigation process
                includes a review of significant safety related near misses as
                well as provisions for the review of contractors in incident
                investigations, when appropriate. The investigation process is
                designed to identify root causes and trends that will lead to
                corrective and preventive action. Staff analyzes incidents to
                detect patterns or trends to anticipate and prevent future
                incidents. The Operator uses the EPASS and Incident Without Loss
                (IWOL) System to track actions until they are completed and
                their effectiveness is verified. Safety lessons learned are

                The Operator’s internal EHS program audits are conducted by EHS
                Audit Manger, Audit Services. The audit planning cycle is
                determined by a comprehensive risk assessment. The Board
                reviewed the 28&nbsp;September&nbsp;2009 EHS MS audit and
                protocols along with the audit response report which shows the
                progression of remedial action to address non-compliances
                identified in the audit. Remedial action is tracked in the EPASS
                system to ensure action items are closed-out. To ensure all
                legislated responsibilities are included, local subject matter
                experts are contracted to ensure appropriate legislation is
                included for the facilities being audited.

              <p>
                As previously noted in Element 2.2 of this report, the Operator
                could not demonstrate that it has a process to identify and
                integrate Canadian Occupational Health and Safety legislation
                into its Safety Program as required by NEB regulations and the
                CLC Part&nbsp;II.

              <p>
                It was verified through interviews and document review that the
                Operator has an internal audit program to assess its EHS MS
                against its regulatory requirements. However, the Board notes
                that the absence of an effective process to identify and
                integrate all of the legal operational safety requirements could
                lead to incomplete EHS audit protocols and inaccurate internal
                audit findings.

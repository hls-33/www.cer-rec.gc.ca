<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Throughout this appendix, reference is made to a document related to the integrity program of SET_PTC’s parent company, Spectra Energy, also referred to as Spectra Energy Transmission (SET). This document is titled the SET Empress L.P. Petroleum Transmission Company (PTC) Pipeline Integrity Program (SET-PTC PIP) and it refers to the PTC/Empress pipeline system in Saskatchewan. In addition, any italicized text corresponds to excerpts taken directly from SET-PTC documents.</p>
<p>Also, there was no separate Pressure Equipment Integrity Manual (PEIM) for SET-PTC at the time of the Integrity Management Program (IMP) audit. During the audit pre-close-out discussion held 9&nbsp;January 2013, SET-PTC provided the Integrity Management System (IMS) Pressure Equipment Integrity Manual (PEIM) which described the quality assurance, inspection and continued safe operation requirements for boilers, pressure vessels and pressure piping as well as the inspection practices for the associated above ground equipment along the PTC pipeline. Information contained in this document has been included in this appendix, where applicable.</p>

<h2 id="s1">1.0 POLICY AND COMMITMENT</h2>
<h3 id="s1_1">1.1 Policy and Commitment Statements</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall have a clearly articulated policy and leadership commitment approved and endorsed by management (the Policy).</p>
<h4>References:<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></h4>
<p>OPR-99 Sections&nbsp;4, 47 and&nbsp;48<br>
CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clauses&nbsp;3.1.2(a) and&nbsp;3.2</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PIP</strong><br>
With respect to sub-element&nbsp;1.1 Policy and Commitment, the SET-PTC PIP contains the management statement in Section&nbsp;1 of the document as follows: <em>“The Pipeline Integrity Program (PIP) is a process for setting policy and expectations for all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the Empress L.P. – Petroleum Transmission Company (PTC) Pipeline and Spur Pipelines. Highly reliable pipelines and quality pipeline integrity practices are critical to the success of the pipeline business. Everyone who engages in the operation, maintenance and reliability of our assets has a personal responsibility for getting pipeline integrity right. Managers and all field personnel should follow this document in order to comply with Empress L.P. – PTC Pipeline integrity policy.”</em></p>
<p>This policy and commitment statement is signed by the Vice President Operations and Engineering, General Manager NGL Midstream and Pipelines, and the Director of Operations Empress.</p>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PEIM</strong><br>
There was no separate PEIM for SET-PTC at the time of the IMP audit, however the SET-PTC PIP policy and commitment statement applies to the PTC pipeline, and therefore covers the pressure equipment associated with the SET-PTC pipeline and facilities.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
Policy and commitment statements exist for the SET-PTC pipeline system. The Operations Management System (OMS) outlines the management commitment and the roles of Operations personnel. The OMS information is located on the SET-PTC intranet site called the Source; however, the SET-PTC policy and commitment document is not located on the Source.</p>
<p>Both management and employees contributed to the development of the OMS. The IMP policy and commitment fits into the hierarchy of the SET-PTC policy and commitments. The OMS is informally reviewed by management with employees but there is no formal communication plan for the various policy and commitment statements. The management system element of communication is reviewed and assessed under 3.4&nbsp;Communication in this appendix.</p>
<p>Based on documents reviewed and interviews, the Company was able to demonstrate that it has policy approved and endorsed by senior management, which commits to continual improvement and is communicated throughout Spectra Energy.</p>

<h3 id="s2_1">2.1 Hazards Identification, Risk Assessment and Control<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall be able to demonstrate a procedure to identify all possible hazards. The company shall assess the degree of risk associated with these hazards. The company should be able to support the rationale for including or excluding possible risks in regard to its environment, safety, integrity, crossings and awareness and emergency management and protection programs (management and protection programs). The company shall be able to implement control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.</p>

CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clauses&nbsp;3.1.2(f), 3.2(a), 3.2(b), 10.5.1.1(d) and&nbsp;16.2</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PIP</strong><br>
With respect to sub-element&nbsp;2.1,, Section&nbsp;3.0&nbsp;Scope, of the SET-PTC PIP states that <em>“the PIP attempts to consider all hazards that may cause significant damage or deterioration to the pipelines</em>.</p>
<p>Section&nbsp;10.0 Pipeline Risk Assessment and sub-section&nbsp;10.1 Risk Assessment Principles of the SET-PTC PIP contain a very general statement as follows: <em>“Risk assessment principles, in various forms, have been the foundation of integrity management. Risk assessments can vary in scope or complexity and use different methods or techniques. The ultimate goal of assessing risks is to identify the most significant risks in an effort to develop an effective and prioritized mitigation plan to maintain long term pipeline reliability and integrity.”</em></p>
<p>Section&nbsp;9.0 Integrity Elements lists the SET-PTC pipeline monitoring and inspection program elements and includes statements relevant to hazard identification and risks associated with the PTC pipeline and facilities.</p>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PEIM</strong><br>
There was no separate PEIM for SET-PTC at the time of the IMP audit. During the audit pre-close-out discussion held 9&nbsp;January 2013, SET-PTC provided the IMS PEIM which described the quality assurance, inspection and continued safe operation requirements for boilers, pressure vessels and pressure piping as well as the inspection practices for the associated above ground equipment along the PTC pipeline. Information contained in this document has been included in this appendix, where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
While the statements quoted in the PIP section indicate that SET-PTC is cognizant of many of the hazards to its pipeline by way of its current monitoring and inspection programs, SET-PTC could not provide a documented hazard identification supporting the rationale for including or excluding industry recognized hazards and/or a documented risk assessment assessing the degree of risk associated with these hazards. A capital project is planned to obtain geo-referenced pipeline and facility data for the PTC pipeline, which would allow SET-PTC to perform a risk assessment with the commercial Dynamic Risk software. This capital project is scheduled for 2013.</p>
<p>Based on documents reviewed and interviews, SET-PTC was not able to demonstrate that it has a procedure to identify all possible hazards. SET-PTC was not able to demonstrate that it has assessed the degree of risk associated with these hazards.</p>
<h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>
<h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall have a verifiable process for the identification and integration of legal requirements into its management and protection programs. The company should have a documented procedure to identify and resolve non-compliances as they relate to legal requirements which includes updating the management and protection programs as required.</p>
<h4>References:</h4>
<p>OPR-99 Sections&nbsp;4, 6, 40 and&nbsp;41(1)<br>
CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clauses&nbsp;3.1.2(h)(i) and&nbsp;3.2</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PIP</strong><br>
The SET-PTC PIP does not include a section specifically detailing the applicable legal requirements; however Section&nbsp;2.0 Introduction states that “<em>The PTC is committed to operating and maintaining its pipeline system in a responsible manner that complies with the requirements of CSA Standard&nbsp;Z662 and the National Energy Board – Onshore Pipeline Regulations.” Section&nbsp;9.9.1 Guidelines for Over Pressure Protection states “The PTC pipelines and all systems delivering Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) must meet the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-07 Section&nbsp;4.18.”</em></p>
<p>The date of the original SET-PTC PIP was December 2010, with the latest revision being July&nbsp;23, 2011. CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 was published in June 2011, so that the SET-PTC PIP should have referenced the latest edition of CSA&nbsp;Z662. This omission is minor in nature since Clause&nbsp;4.18 Pressure control and overpressure protection of piping is the same in both the 2007 and 2011 versions of CSA&nbsp;Z662. Other Clauses of CSA&nbsp;Z662 have substantively changed in the 2011 version, so that for accurate referencing to this standard, the PIP should reference the latest edition of CSA&nbsp;Z662.</p>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PEIM</strong><br>
There was no separate PEIM for SET-PTC at the time of the IMP audit. During the audit pre-close-out discussion held 9&nbsp;January 2013 SET-PTC provided the IMS PEIM which described the quality assurance, inspection and continued safe operation requirements for boilers, pressure vessels and pressure piping as well as the inspection practices for the associated above ground equipment along the PTC pipeline. Information contained in this document has been included in this appendix, where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
The SET-PTC PIP has no process for the identification and integration of its legal requirements other than references imbedded in its Introduction. SET-PTC does not have a procedure for reviewing and updating revisions to the legal requirements. However, SET-PTC personnel have representations on regulatory committees (e.g. Canadian Standards Association (CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 and CSA&nbsp;B51-09), technical committees, and the International Pressure Equipment Association, so that they have a mechanism for being informed on current and upcoming regulations and industry best practices.</p>
<p>The IMS PEIM for SET-PTC pressure equipment does not contain a section on legal requirements although some references are imbedded in section&nbsp;2.5 (Definitions Terms and Acronyms) where there is reference to such standards as API&nbsp;510 and ABSA&nbsp;AB-512. This indicates that SET-PTC is aware of the requirements for pressure equipment, but a formal process to identify and integrate its legal requirements has not been included in the SET-PTC PEIM.</p>
<p>Based on documents reviewed and interviews with staff, SET-PTC was not able to demonstrate that it has formally identified its legal requirements or fully integrated its regulatory obligations into its IMP.</p>
<h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>
<h3 id="s2_3">2.3 Goals, Objectives and Targets</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall have objectives and quantifiable targets relevant to the risks and hazards associated with the company’s facilities and activities (i.e. construction, operations and maintenance). The objectives and targets shall be measurable and consistent with the Policy and legal requirements and ideally include continual improvement and prevention initiatives, where appropriate.</p>

<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>With respect to the sub-element&nbsp;2.3, the SET-PTC PIP does not contain a section on any specific, measureable goals, objectives and targets; however, in Section&nbsp;4.0 Program Objectives, the SET-PTC PIP states that its general objectives are:</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br> 
In March 2012, the Board posted its <a href="/sftnvrnmnt/sft/pplnprfrmncmsr/pplnprfrmncmsrrprtngrgdnc-eng.html">Pipeline Performance Measures Reporting Requirements</a> stating that operating companies are required to annually report on the new performance measures commencing in 2013. The requirement to report on the new performance measures is in addition to current reporting required under the <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999</em> and the <em>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</em>, Part&nbsp;I and Part&nbsp;II. Part&nbsp;IV of the posted document specifies the reporting requirements for Integrity Management.</p>
<p>SET-PTC has not developed goals, objectives and quantifiable targets relevant to the risks and hazards associated with the PTC pipeline facilities and activities. This is a requirement of Spectra Energy as set out in Section&nbsp;6.0 Responsibility, Leadership and Accountability, which states that <em>“Those who have leadership roles in the PTC that includes pipeline integrity are automatically responsible for specific pipeline integrity management performance targets, which include (sub-section&nbsp;vii) measuring, reviewing and improving our pipeline integrity performance.”</em></p>
<p>Based on documents reviewed and interviews with operations staff, SET-PTC was not able to demonstrate that it was in compliance with the requirements of audit sub-element&nbsp;2.3.</p>

<p><strong>SET-PTC PEIM</strong><br>
There was no separate PEIM for SET-PTC at the time of the IMP audit. During the audit pre-close-out discussion held 9&nbsp;January 2013, SET-PTC provided its IMS PEIM which described the quality assurance, inspection and continued safe operation requirements for boilers, pressure vessels and pressure piping as well as the inspection practices for the associated above ground equipment along the PTC pipeline. Information contained in this document has been included in this appendix, where applicable.</p>
<p>The recently submitted document, IMS PEIM, at sections&nbsp;2.7 Management Responsibility and&nbsp;2.7.3 Management Commitment states <em>“Communications regarding key learnings, events, or changes affecting the safety of pressure equipment will be transferred as necessary to the broader organization through an effective platform or media. Examples of these communications might include, but are not limited to, Incident Reporting, Information Bulletins, electronic mail, or informing the Management Representative and the AMT of relevant changes to legislation.”</em></p>
<p>
<strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
In response to an Audit Information Request, Spectra personnel stated:</p>
<p><em>“With respect to pipeline integrity, we do not have a documented communication plan however, the pipeline System Integrity group addresses communication through the following events:</em></p>
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
<li><em>An annual SOP and Integrity Program review involving all directors, managers, team lead system integrity and other subject matter experts;</em></li>
<li><em>A monthly Pipeline Integrity Conference call chaired by System Integrity with invitations to directors, managers, team leads and field technicians;</em></li>
<li><em>The annual pipeline integrity workshop (typically 40 to 50 attendees);</em></li>
<li><em>Frequent integrity presentations to the Operations Steering Committee; and</em></li>
<li><em>Other special topic meetings initiated as required by System Integrity.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>SET-PTC has demonstrated that it has several methods of ad hoc communication of relevant integrity related issues and the SET-PTC PIP clearly states the responsibilities and accountabilities for communication.</p>
<p>CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clause&nbsp;3.1.1 states that “Operating companies shall develop, implement, and maintain a documented safety and loss management system for the pipeline system that provides for the protection of people, the environment and property.” Clause&nbsp;3.1.2 states “The safety and loss management system shall include the following elements: (d) a communication plan that supports the effective implementation and operation of the safety and loss management system.”</p>
<p>SET-PTC was not able to demonstrate that it has an adequate, effective and documented communication process, and therefore did not demonstrate compliance with this audit sub-element.</p>
<h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>

The SET-PTC PIP Section&nbsp;11.0 Audits, states <em>“PTC corporate auditors regularly conduct audits of operations and the programs used by operations. The detailed charter of the Spectra Energy Audit Services Department can be found on the Spectra Intranet. Additional targeted audits may be requested by senior management as required.”</em> [...]</p>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PEIM</strong><br>
There was no separate PEIM for SET-PTC at the time of the IMP audit. During the audit pre-close-out discussion held 9&nbsp;January 2013, SET-PTC provided the IMS PEIM which described the quality assurance, inspection and continued safe operation requirements for boilers, pressure vessels and pressure piping as well as the inspection practices for the associated above ground equipment along the PTC pipeline. Information contained in this document has been included in this appendix, where applicable.</p>

<h2 id="s5">5.0 MANAGEMENT REVIEW</h2>
<h3 id="s5_1">5.1 Management Review</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall formally review the management and protection programs for continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The review should be based on appropriate documentation and records including the results of the surveillance, monitoring and audit programs. This review should be formal and documented and should occur on a regular basis. The management review should include a review of any decisions, actions and commitments which relate to the improvement of the programs and the company’s overall performance.</p>

CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clauses&nbsp;3.1.2(h)(iii) and&nbsp;3.2</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PIP</strong><br>
Section&nbsp;6.0 of the SET-PTC PIP outlines the Responsibilities, Leadership &amp; Accountability for the Empress L.P. – PTC Pipeline Integrity Program. Section&nbsp;6.1 states <em>“Those who have leadership roles in the PTC that includes pipeline integrity are automatically responsible for specific pipeline integrity management performance targets, which include: sub-section&nbsp;vii Measuring, reviewing and improving our pipeline integrity performance.”</em></p>
<p>Section&nbsp;8.2 Integrity Programs, Plans and Practices states that <em>“Each year the PTC Pipeline Manager will initiate a review of the Integrity Program. This review will consider any regulatory changes, audit results, suggested changes, industry practices and events. The results of this review will be provided to the Empress Operations Manager.”</em></p>
<p><strong>SET-PTC PEIM</strong><br>
There was no separate PEIM for SET-PTC at the time of the IMP audit. During the audit pre-close-out discussion held 9&nbsp;January 2013, SET-PTC provided the IMS PEIM which described the quality assurance, inspection and continued safe operation requirements for boilers, pressure vessels and pressure piping as well as the inspection practices for the associated above ground equipment along the PTC pipeline. Information contained in this document has been included in this Appendix, where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
In response to the Draft Audit Report, SET-PTC provided the SET-West Occupational Steering Committee Short Term Incentive Pay (STIP) Scorecard for December 2012 (Scorecard) and commented that the Scorecard included Key Performance Metrics for Integrity and Measurement Compliance. The one performance metric described in the Scorecard was Cathodic Protection Effectiveness (Transmission). While the Scorecard describes one performance metric reviewed by management to monitor IMP performance, it was not adequate to demonstrate the required link between current management review processes and IMP performance, or that SET-PTC is conducting regular management review of its IMP to assess its continued suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.</p>
<p>There are ad hoc, non-formalized management reviews occurring; however, there are no documented processes for these (e.g., annual review of the PIP and SOPs, monthly IMP meetings, annual IMP workshops, etc.). Senior management review in this instance is not formally undertaken with a view to ensuring the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the SET-PTC PIP.</p>
<p>Based on documents reviewed and interviews with operations staff, SET-PTC was not able to demonstrate that it was in compliance with the requirements of this audit sub-element.</p>

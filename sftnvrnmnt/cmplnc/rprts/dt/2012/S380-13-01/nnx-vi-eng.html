<h2 id="s1">1.0 POLICY AND COMMITMENT</h2>
<h3 id="s1_1">1.1 Policy and Commitment Statements</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall have a policy approved and endorsed by senior management (the Policy). It should include goals and objectives and commit to improving the performance of the company.</p>
<h4>References:<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></h4>
<p>OPR-99 Sections&nbsp;4, 47 and&nbsp;48<br>
CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clause&nbsp;3.1.2 (a)</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>The PTC Pipeline has been operated by SET-PTC since 2005 and adheres to the Spectra Energy Transmission West (SET-West) environment, health and safety (EHS) policies and procedures. SET-West senior management participates in several committees that oversee the development and implementation of the policies that frame the EHS program. For the purposes of this audit, SET-PTC’s Public Awareness (PA) Program is considered to be part of its Safety Program. The Safety Policy present at the field locations is signed off on by senior management. SET-PTC management communicates the policy for its EHS program through an Operational Steering Committee.</p>
<p>The Policy was available at all sites visited for the audit and staff interviews confirmed that employees are aware of its existence. The purpose statement from the 2012 Policy states:</p>
<p>“To achieve our purpose we manage risk in everything we do, by continuously improving on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee, contractor and vehicle safety;</li>
<li>Process safety;</li>
<li>Environmental Management;</li>
<li>Reliability; and</li>
<li>Cost management.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Although SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that its Policy is signed off on by senior management and communicated to employees; the audit found that a reference to public safety is not explicitly written into the purpose statement. Interviews confirmed that, while staff members were familiar with the Policy, they could not identify the link between the Policy and public safety goals.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of public safety in the Policy, the current Policy at SET-PTC does not adequately support the PA Program. SET-PTC did not demonstrate that it prioritizes and mitigates the risks regarding its interactions with and obligations to third parties, and the public at large.</p>
<p>While it is understood that public safety is implied in the current Policy, the heightened importance of public safety is underscored by its express reference in the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and associated regulations.</p>

<h3 id="s2_1">2.1 Hazards Identification, Risk Assessment and Control<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall be able to demonstrate a procedure to identify all possible hazards. The company should assess the degree of risk associated with these hazards. The company should be able to support the rationale for including or excluding possible risks in regard to its environment, safety, integrity, crossings and awareness and emergency management and protection programs (management and protection programs). The company should be able to implement control measures to minimize or eliminate the risk.</p>
<h4>References:</h4>
<p>OPR-99 Sections&nbsp;4(2), 37, 39, 40 and&nbsp;41<br>
CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clause&nbsp;3.1.2 (f)</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>SET-PTC’s PA Program addresses the hazards to its pipeline posed by third party activity. The Public Awareness Coordinator (Coordinator) has implemented a plan to address the hazards that have been identified in the area. The Coordinator organizes and conducts all of the public awareness activities that correspond to the risks identified, such as new farming practices or high risk activities in certain areas. The risk assessment also informs the outreach plan for the PA Program in order to plan activities to correspond to the risks.</p>
<p>For the Coordinator who conducts the onsite landowner visits, there are also risks and hazards associated with going alone to remote properties. In order to minimize the risks associated with resident visits such as dogs on the loose and poor driving conditions, the Coordinator contacts each resident and Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) resident to make appointments for public awareness meetings on a three-year cycle. By making appointments, the Coordinator allows the landowners to choose a time when they will be home to reduce the likelihood of wasted trips and to secure their pets if required.</p>
<p>SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that it has developed a hazard identification process for its PA Program that includes risk assessment both for the PA Program development as well as staff protection.</p>
<h4>Compliance Status: Compliant</h4>
<h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall have a verifiable process for the identification and integration of legal requirements into its management and protection programs. The company should have a documented procedure to identify and resolve non-compliances as they relate to legal requirements which includes updating the management and protection programs as required.</p>

<p>OPR-99 Sections&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;6<br>
<em>Pipeline Crossing Regulations</em> (PCR) Part&nbsp;II Sections&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5<br>
CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clause&nbsp;3.1.2(h)(i)</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>As part of the SET-West system, SET-PTC receives legal updates through the SET-West Regulatory Affairs group. The Regulatory Affairs group communicates regulatory changes via an email distribution list to all team leads. It is then up to the recipients on the distribution list to identify any changes that are relevant to their respective operational processes. According to SET-PTC staff, the Regulatory Affairs group also confirms deadlines for regulatory compliance such as the requirements of the NEB Exemption Order Respecting Crossings by Agricultural Vehicles or Mobile Equipment (Order). Document review showed that the legal requirements inventory kept at the SET-PTC office was last updated in 2009. There was no indication that recent updates, including updates to the NEB Act or the Order, were identified and incorporated into this legal requirements inventory.</p>
<p>While SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that communication of regulatory requirements is occurring, and that current personnel are incorporating some new legal requirements into the procedures, SET-PTC did not demonstrate that there was an effective process to verify whether all appropriate legal requirements were incorporated into procedures and implemented as required.</p>
<h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>
<h3 id="s2_3">2.3 Goals, Objectives and Targets</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company should have goals, objectives and quantifiable targets relevant to the risks and hazards associated with the company’s facilities and activities (i.e. construction, operations and maintenance). The objectives and targets should be measurable and consistent with the Policy and legal requirements and ideally include continual improvement and prevention initiatives, where appropriate.</p>
<h4>References:</h4>
<p>OPR-99 Sections&nbsp;47 and&nbsp;48</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>SET-PTC employees are subject to the goals established by SET-West. SET-West’s goals often include issues related to safety and operations. For example, one of this year’s corporate goals was for 100% of staff to complete the core safety training by 31&nbsp;October 2012. Goals and targets for the Coordinator are established with the PTC Pipeline Manager. Then they are managed and tracked through performance management and tied to the organization-wide Short Term Incentive Pay (STIP) program.</p>
<p>Goals are established for the PA Program based on the activities of the previous year. To evaluate whether the PA Program has met its targets, the Coordinator reports on the outreach activities such as number of stakeholder visits conducted, number of trade shows attended and number of attendees at its contractor safety awareness breakfasts.</p>
<p>SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that there is a process for establishing goals, targets and objectives for its PA Program, and that related issues are monitored, measured, and used to form the basis of the PA Program strategy going forward.</p>

<h2 id="s3">3.0 IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<h3 id="s3_1">3.1 Organizational Structure, Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall have an organizational structure that allows its management and protection programs to effectively function. The company should have clear roles and responsibilities, which may include responsibilities for the development, implementation and management of the management and protection programs.</p>
<h4>References:</h4>
<p>OPR-99 sections&nbsp;40, 47 and&nbsp;48<br>
CSA&nbsp;Z662-11 Clauses&nbsp;3.1.2 (b)</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>At the time of the audit, there were less than 40 employees working on the SET-PTC pipeline system. As a result of the number of staff, most employees have a wide range of responsibilities. For public awareness, there is one person who coordinates and executes the PA Program for the SET-PTC assets in Saskatchewan. Reporting to the PTC Pipeline Manager, this Coordinator’s duties include conducting roughly 1500 landowner and resident visits every three years, annual contractor safety shows, as well as first responder and community liaison training in communities along the PTC pipeline. According to the job description, the Coordinator is also responsible for managing third party crossing applications and training records.</p>
<p>Although the Coordinator had a current job description which included all of the various responsibilities, the audit determined that SET-PTC could not demonstrate that it has a process in place to verify the ongoing suitability of the organizational structure as it applies to the PA Program. The absence of an evaluation of resources has resulted in the potential overburden of the Coordinator following a recent staff change. This past year when the Coordinator in Manitoba retired, the Saskatchewan Coordinator’s duties were expanded to include all PA Program duties in Manitoba. This additional work adds approximately 900-1000 residents, additional communities and first responders who all require visits every three years and education in order for SET-PTC to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in safety and emergency response. Without a formal review process to determine whether or not the Coordinator is able to absorb the additional responsibilities and maintain the required level of effectiveness, SET-PTC cannot ensure that the PA Program will continue to meet regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>SET-PTC failed to demonstrate that it has implemented an adequate process to assess its organizational structure to ensure the appropriate resources are in place to maintain an effective PA Program.</p>
<h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>
<h3 id="s3_2">3.2 Management of Change</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>Expectations: The company shall have a management of change program. The program should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>identification of changes that could affect the management and protection programs;</li>
<li>documentation of the changes; and</li>
<li>analysis of implications and effects of the changes, including introduction of new risks or hazards or legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>References:</h4>
<p>OPR-99 Section&nbsp;6<br>
CSA-Z662-11 Clause&nbsp;3.1.2(g)</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>SET-West is in the process of implementing a comprehensive Management of Change (MOC) process for all SET-West affiliates including SET-PTC. Interviews confirmed that SET-PTC will implement the MOC process being developed and implemented as part of the new Operations Management System (OMS) being introduced at SET-West. The SET-West MOC Descriptions of <em>Affected Applications, Systems, Documentation and Processes</em> document describes the circumstances for involving the PA Program in the MOC process. According to the document, the current MOC process dictates that the public awareness group is notified and evaluated for potential impacts when there are changes to the information system and databases. As it is currently an MOC triggered by changes to assets such as databases which are not in use at SET-PTC, the audit determined that there are no triggers for the MOC process to include the SET-PTC PA Program.</p>
<p>Although there are aspects of a functioning asset-based MOC process being implemented for SET-PTC, and a more developed MOC process is in development, at the time of the audit, SET-PTC failed to demonstrate that it has a comprehensive MOC process implemented that includes the appropriate triggers to include the PA Program.</p>
<h4>Compliance Status: Non-Compliant</h4>
<h3 id="s3_3">3.3 Training, Competence and Evaluation</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall have a documented training program for employees and contractors related to the company’s management and protection programs. The company shall inform visitors to company maintenance sites of the practices and procedures to be followed. Training requirements should include information about program-specific policies. Training should include emergency preparedness and environmental response requirements as well as the potential consequences of not following the requirements. The company should determine the required levels of competency for employees and contractors. Training shall evaluate competency to ensure desired knowledge requirements have been met. Training programs should include record management procedures. The training program should include methods to ensure staff remains current in their required training.

<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>SET-PTC staff confirmed in interviews that they attend training that is tracked through the Learning Management System (LMS). All mandatory training is entered in the LMS database and the LMS notifies staff when refresher training is due. Training required for the SET-PTC pipeline technicians includes both internally provided online training courses, as well as externally provided training for the locate equipment. As well, all employees involved in emergency response have Incident Command training. Annual performance reviews and staff development plans are managed in the Career Zone database and linked to the STIP Program.</p>
<p>Due to the integration of the PA Program and the continuing education aspect of the Emergency Management Program, the Coordinator also attends training for the Incident Command system for emergency management, as well as courses to improve communication and conflict resolution skills.SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that it has a process to identify, track and maintain records on employee training. As well, SET-PTC demonstrated that staff involved in the PA Program are trained and evaluated.</p>

<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>The Coordinator conducts visits with third parties and first responders. The SET-PTC stakeholder outreach aspect of the PA Program includes presentations to various stakeholder groups where the Coordinator presents safety messages. Also, the Coordinator represents SET-PTC and works with the Saskatchewan Common Ground Alliance and Sask First-Call to organize contractor safety breakfasts, and other related trade shows to discuss general safety practices and regulatory requirements for working around federally-regulated pipelines. The SET-PTC external website also contains readily available safety and contact information. The internal communication at SET-PTC occurs informally in the office.</p>
<p>SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that it has established a PA Program and that it measures the effectiveness of this program on a regular basis. Although communication is occurring within the PA Program, and there are triggers in place from the program to communicate with external stakeholders, SET-PTC failed to demonstrate that there is a formal communication plan that includes the PA Program in order to ensure that relevant information is communicated in a timely way throughout the organization.</p>

PCR Part&nbsp;II Section&nbsp;13</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>For the PA Program, non-compliances in respect of the PCR involve unauthorized activities performed by third parties. SET-PTC conducts regular right of way inspections to monitor for excavation and construction activities that have occurred near its pipeline without permission from the pipeline company. All unauthorized activities are reportable to the NEB under the PCR. The Coordinator manages the reporting of and response to all unauthorized activities. The Coordinator uses the unauthorized activity reports to identify trends to address with public awareness sessions or material in the next PA Program planning cycle. Record review indicates that unauthorized activities are considered to be near misses and are entered into SET-PTC’s Incident Investigation System as incidents without loss and filed in the Richardson Station office in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>SET-PTC demonstrated that it has implemented procedures for identifying, reporting and investigating unauthorized activities. The Coordinator uses the reports of unauthorized activities to inform the PA Program on an ongoing basis. The Coordinator also conducts ‘on-demand’ public awareness presentations or workshops for parties who have conducted the unauthorized activities.</p>
<p>SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that its PA Program contains an adequate process to investigate incidents and respond to non-compliances.</p>

<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>SET-PTC manages the records generated by its business, which are kept both on the local shared G drive, and in hard copy at the SET-PTC Richardson Station. These records include presentations, contractor safety event documents, and the Saskatchewan Canadian Gas Association records. Contact information for residents along and adjacent to the right of way is maintained in a spreadsheet on the G drive. The Coordinator confirms the accuracy of this information every three years during the landowner visits. The spreadsheet also contains any relevant notes from the last visit such as special evacuation requirements of the residents.</p>
<p>While the SET-PTC records management continues to be managed manually using hard copy files, SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that it has a records management procedure that allows its records to be retained, maintained and retrieved in accordance with regulatory expectations and requirements</p>

<h3 id="s4_4">4.4 Internal Audit</h3>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>The company shall develop and implement a documented process to undertake audits of its management and protection programs and procedures. The audit process should identify and manage the training and competency requirements for staff carrying out the audits. These audits shall be conducted on a regular basis.</p>
<h4>References:</h4>
<p>OPR-99 Section&nbsp;53</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>Senior management of Spectra Audit Services is located in Houston, Texas. However, an audit manager and several staff are located in Calgary, Alberta. Calgary-based audit staff perform most of the SET-PTC internal audits, sometimes with participation by Houston-based audit staff. These audits occur on a regular basis and vary in size and scope. All non-compliant findings are tracked in a database and assigned to staff for completion reported to senior management. However, interviews and document review confirm that these audits are conducted to measure the company’s compliance to its own internal program requirements and do not necessarily address its programs’ compliance to regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>While aspects of the SET-PTC operations are included in the internal audits, SET-PTC was not able to demonstrate that the PA Program and the requirements of PCR have been scoped into any internal operational audits. Also it did not demonstrate that the requirements of the PCR are included in its audit protocols for the audits regarding safety of the public in order to confirm compliance.</p>

<h2 id="s5">5.0 MANAGEMENT REVIEW</h2>
<h4>Expectations:</h4>
<p>Senior management should formally review the management and protection programs for continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The review should be based on appropriate documentation and records including the results of the surveillance, monitoring and audit programs. This review should be formal and documented and should occur on a regular basis. The management review should include a review of any decisions, actions and commitments which relate to the improvement of the programs and the company’s overall performance.</p>
<h4>References:</h4>
<p>OPR-99 Section&nbsp;53<br>
PCR Part&nbsp;II Sections&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5</p>
<h4>Assessment:</h4>
<p>The Manager of the PTC pipeline meets with senior management annually to discuss resources and review accountabilities. As well, interviews and document review indicate that there is regular communication SET-PTC’s area management, operations management and senior management teams. SET-PTC’s senior management also holds meetings on a regular basis at different field locations to evaluate the operations of the pipeline and associated facilities.</p>
<p>While the Board acknowledges that there is communication occurring among SET-PTC’s area management, operations management and senior management teams, SET-PTC was unable to demonstrate that it has established the processes that contribute to an adequate management review. As noted in sub-element&nbsp;2.2 of this appendix, SET-PTC does not have a formal process of confirming that there is a current and complete inventory of legal requirements guiding the development and implementation of its PA Program. SET-PTC’s internal audit process does not include an evaluation of compliance to the PCR, which outline the requirements for addressing third party activities. Without this confirmation of compliance, senior management cannot verify that the PA Program is operating in compliance with all of the requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, SET-PTC’s policy and purpose statement does not explicitly include public safety, and so there is no clear line of sight from SET-PTC’s policy to the PA Program. Therefore the Board is not satisfied that there are sufficient processes in place by senior management to ensure ongoing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the PA Program.</p>

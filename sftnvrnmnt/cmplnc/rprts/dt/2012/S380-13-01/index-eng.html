          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            As part of its compliance verification program, the National Energy
            Board (NEB or Board) conducted an audit of SET-PTC’s Integrity
            Management, Safety, Environmental Protection, Emergency Management,
            Crossings and Public Awareness Programs (Programs) as they apply to
            its pipeline facilities. These Programs, and their content, are
            required to be developed under the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act), the
            <em>Canada Labour Code</em> (CLC), and their associated regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            This audit is one of a series three audits being undertaken by the
            Board with respect to NEB regulated facilities operated within
            Spectra Energy’s organization. The others are: the
            <em>National Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations</em> Audit of
            the McMahon Gas Plant and the concurrent audit of Spectra Energy’s
            British Columbia pipeline facilities (Westcoast). These audits
            identified that Spectra Energy is operating its facilities using a
            common organizational and technical management structure for all of
            the facilities noted. The findings are therefore similar in each
            audit, and the individual audit reports reflect this. During the
            audit, the Board reviewed and evaluated each set of facilities based
            on the individual activities, as well as the associated hazards and
            risks, as reflected in the individual audit reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            The audit identified that SET-PTC is implementing technical programs
            to manage and control the hazards associated with its pipeline
            facilities. The audit did, however, identify a number of
            non-compliant findings. The majority of the non-compliant findings
            relate to SET-PTC’s lack of formal, proactive and systematic
            identification, review and management of its legal requirements, and
            its safety and environmental hazards, across its Programs. The audit
            identified that the majority of hazards had been included in
            SET-PTC’s procedures and practices; however, these hazards were
            primarily identified by SET-PTC staff either through personal
            knowledge, or in the operating permits issued by other regulatory
            bodies, rather than through required systematic reviews and
            assessment processes. This has resulted in SET-PTC being unable to
            demonstrate that its Programs are compliant. Board is of the view
            that these non-compliance findings do not pose an undue hazard
            during the development and implementation of a CAP to address the
            deficiencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that within the management system elements of its
            audit protocols there are conceptual linkages between sub-elements.
            As a result, a finding of non-compliance in a particular sub-element
            may necessarily result in multiple findings of non-compliance within
            each Program area. This is particularly evident in this audit due to
            SET-PTC’s non-compliant hazard identification and assessment
            practices. Within the Appendices to this report, the Board has
            identified each of the linked sub-element findings to assist SET-PTC
            in implementing all necessary corrective actions to its Programs to
            ensure safety management and environmental protection.

          <h2 id="s1">1.0 Introduction: NEB Purpose and Framework</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB’s purpose is to promote safety and security, environmental
            protection, and efficient energy infrastructure and markets in the
            Canadian public interest within the mandate set by Parliament in the
            regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            To evaluate compliance with its regulations, the NEB undertakes
            audits of its regulated companies. Following the audits, companies
            are required to submit and implement a CAP to address and mitigate
            all findings of non-compliance. The results of the audits are
            applied to the NEB’s risk-informed life cycle approach to
            compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB requires that each company be able to demonstrate the
            adequacy and implementation of the methods they have selected and
            employed to achieve compliance.

            This audit is one of a series three audits being undertaken by the
            Board with respect to NEB regulated facilities operated within
            Spectra Energy’s organization. The others are: the

          <p>
            SET-PTC holds the certificate and the assets for the SET-PTC
            pipeline system, which is owned and operated by Spectra Energy.
            Spectra Energy has ownership of several different pipeline systems
            in Canada and the United States. With respect to the SET-PTC
            pipeline system only, Spectra Energy sometimes refers to itself as
            Spectra Energy Transmission West, Spectra Energy Transmission BC or
            Spectra Energy BC Pipeline and Field Services. As such, the job
            titles of employees interviewed, as well as the titles of
            documentation reviewed, reflect these variations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SET-PTC pipeline system is shown in
            <a href="#f1">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, and runs from the Empress Plant
            near Burstall on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, to Fort Whyte near
            Winnipeg, Manitoba. The pipeline is 933 km and transports natural
            gas liquids (propane and butane) to various SET-PTC shipping
            terminals and underground storage facilities. This OPR-99 audit
            included an assessment of SET-PTC’s Integrity Management, Safety,
            Environmental Protection, Emergency Management, Crossings and Public
            Awareness Programs (Programs) as they apply to its pipeline system.

          <p>
            The Board chose to audit SET-PTC by utilizing a risk-informed
            approach that included a review of previous compliance history. On
            23&nbsp;November 2012, an opening meeting was conducted with
            representatives from SET-PTC in Calgary, Alberta to discuss the
            objectives, scope and process of the audit, and to initiate the
            development of a schedule for conducting the audit site visits and
            staff interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            Daily debriefs were held at the end of each day of both head office
            interviews and field verification, to communicate issues to SET-PTC
            representatives. On 9&nbsp;January 2013, an Audit Pre-Close-Out
            Discussion was conducted at SET-PTC’s offices in Calgary, where the
            results of the audit, including an outline of the draft audit
            non-compliances, were presented to SET-PTC. At that time, the
            Board’s auditors invited SET-PTC to provide any documentation that
            may mitigate, or negate, any non-compliances. A Final Audit
            Close-Out Meeting was held on 15&nbsp;January 2013. SET-PTC offered
            no concerns with the Board’s findings as they were presented.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board’s Draft Audit Report was issued on 7&nbsp;February 2013.
            On 6&nbsp;March 2013, Westcoast submitted comments on the Draft
            Audit Report. These comments were reviewed by the Board and have
            been addressed, where appropriate, in the Appendices.

          <h2 id="s6">6.0 Audit Results – Summary by Program Area</h2>
          <p>
            The audit identified a number of findings across the Programs that
            were evaluated. A summary of the findings in each Program area is as
            follows:
          </p>
          <h3><em>Integrity Management Program</em></h3>
          <p>
            SET-PTC demonstrated that it has an Integrity Management Program
            (IMP) for its pipeline facilities. However, SET-PTC has not met the
            Board’s expectations for a complete, robust and fully implemented
            IMP. Of particular note were the non-compliances with respect to
            management system sub-elements&nbsp;4.4 - Internal Audit
            and&nbsp;5.1 - Management Review.
          </p>
          <p>
            Review of the non-compliant sub-elements and SET-PTC’s IMP, as
            implemented, indicates that the deficiencies generally do not
            reflect a complete system failure in any area. The audit identified
            that SET-PTC’s IMP includes and mitigates the majority of possible
            hazards to the pipeline system.
          </p>
          <p>
            For details associated with the assessment of the management system
            elements of the IMP, refer to

              >Appendix&nbsp;I</a
            >: SET-PTC Integrity Management Program Audit Evaluation Table.
          </p>
          <h3><em>Safety Program</em></h3>
          <p>
            SET-PTC demonstrated that it has an established Environmental,
            Health and Safety Management System (EHS MS) with some elements and
            processes that allow for continual improvement. The EHS MS contains
            procedures for identified work tasks typically encountered by
            SET-PTC personnel. SET-PTC holds various meetings and completes
            reports which monitor and document the EHS MS safety component.
            SET-PTC has also implemented a record retention process which
            includes: appropriate types of records to be retained; retention and
            disposition timeframes; and disposal methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although SET-PTC’s EHS MS has many of the elements required in a
            management system, SET-PTC has not met the Board’s expectations for
            a complete, robust and fully implemented Safety Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            For details associated with the management system elements of the
            Safety Program, refer to
            <a
              href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2012/S380-13-01/nnx-ii-eng.html"
              >Appendix&nbsp;II</a
            >: SET-PTC Safety Program Audit Evaluation Table.
          </p>
          <h3><em>Environmental Protection Program</em></h3>
          <p>
            The audit of SET-PTC’s Environmental Protection (EP) Program
            revealed a number of non-compliant areas. The non-compliant
            sub-elements generally appear to be related to one of two basic
            deficiencies: a lack of formal and systematic procedures for the
            identification and evaluation of all legal requirements, as well as
            its environmental hazards and aspects; and a lack of professional
            environmental resources for the development and implementation of
            the EP Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deficiencies identified do not reflect a complete system failure
            in any area. As SET-PTC’s EP Program utilizes reaction-oriented
            initiatives, it captures and mitigates most of the environmental
            hazards and aspects resulting from SET-PTC’s operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For details associated with the assessment of the management system
            elements of the EP Program, refer to
            <a
              href="/sftnvrnmnt/cmplnc/rprts/dt/2012/S380-13-01/nnx-iii-eng.html"

            >: SET-PTC Environmental Protection Program Audit Evaluation Table.
          </p>
          <h3><em>Emergency Management Program</em></h3>
          <p>
            Review of the Emergency Management (EM) Program for the SET–PTC
            pipeline facilities indicates that, while there are a number of
            non-compliant findings assigned, the company has a reasonably
            developed EM Program. The documents and records demonstrate that the
            company is ensuring that its staff, and potentially involved
            agencies, public and mutual aid partners, are appropriately informed
            and/or trained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Review of the non-compliant findings made by the Board indicates
            that they are related to the formal development and consistent
            implementation of company-wide (Spectra Energy) management system
            procedures which apply to the SET-PTC EM Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that the non-compliant findings in
            sub-elements&nbsp;3.1 (Organizational Structure), and&nbsp;4.4
            (Internal Audits) have contributed to the non-compliant finding in
            sub-element&nbsp;5.1 Management Review. In order to become compliant
            in these areas, senior management will need to develop and/or
            implement formal management processes to demonstrate that the EM
            Program continues to be adequately resourced, monitored and
            effectively reviewed.
          </p>

            elements of the EM Program, refer to

            >: SET-PTC Emergency Management Program Audit Evaluation Table.
          </p>
          <h3><em>Crossings Program</em></h3>
          <p>
            SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that it has established a Crossings
            Program to support the management of third party excavation and
            construction around its pipelines. However, there were findings of
            non-compliance in the policy, management of change, legal
            requirements and internal audit sub-elements due to a lack of
            formalized oversight of the Crossings Program, and a lack of
            integration within SET-PTC’s EHS MS. The audit identified that
            SET-PTC is undertaking work to manage and control the hazards
            associated with its facilities, processes and activities.
            Notwithstanding this, the audit identified a number of non-compliant
            findings. The majority of the non-compliant findings relate to
            SET-PTC’s lack of formal, proactive and systematic identification,
            review and management of its legal requirements, and its safety and
            environmental hazards across its Programs. The audit identified that
            the majority of hazards had been included in SET-PTC’s procedures
            and practices; however, these hazards were primarily identified by
            SET-PTC staff either through personal knowledge or in the operating
            permits issued by other regulatory bodies, rather than through
            required systematic reviews and assessment processes. This has
            resulted in SET-PTC being unable to demonstrate that all its Program
            sub-elements are compliant. With respect to these findings, the
            Board is of the view that the processes presently used by SET-PTC
            have identified the majority, and most significant, of its hazards
            and risks. The Board is of the view that these non-compliance
            findings do not pose an undue hazard during the development and
            implementation of a CAP to address the deficiencies.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h3><em>Public Awareness Program</em></h3>
          <p>
            SET-PTC was able to demonstrate that it has established a Public
            Awareness Program to support the effective communication with third
            parties who live and work around its pipelines. Deficiencies noted
            in the PA Program do not relate to its implementation, rather to the
            lack of integration within the EHS MS. The findings of
            non-compliance for the policy, management of change, legal
            requirements, organizational structure and internal audit
            sub-elements denote a lack of formalized oversight over, and
            evaluation of, the program’s continued ability to meet the Board’s
            expectations.
          </p>

          <h2 id="s7">7.0 Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            The audit identified that SET-PTC is undertaking work to manage and
            control the hazards associated with its facilities, processes and
            activities. Notwithstanding this, the audit identified a number of
            non-compliant findings. The majority of the non-compliant findings
            relate to SET-PTC’s lack of formal, proactive and systematic
            identification, review and management of its legal requirements, and
            its safety and environmental hazards across its Programs. The audit
            identified that the majority of hazards had been included in
            SET-PTC’s procedures and practices; however, these hazards were
            primarily identified by SET-PTC staff either through personal
            knowledge or in the operating permits issued by other regulatory
            bodies, rather than through required systematic reviews and
            assessment processes. This has resulted in SET-PTC being unable to
            demonstrate that all its Program sub-elements are compliant. With
            respect to these findings, the Board is of the view that the
            processes presently used by SET-PTC have identified the majority,
            and most significant, of its hazards and risks. The Board is of the
            view that these non-compliance findings do not pose an undue hazard
            during the development and implementation of a CAP to address the
            deficiencies.

            These elements and sub-elements are arranged to match standard
            management system elements to aid in the evaluation of the
            requirements. The Programs were audited against each of these
            elements and sub-elements. The detailed findings of these
            assessments are provided in the audit evaluation tables appended to
            this OPR-99 Final Audit Report. A summary of these results is
            presented in the SET-PTC Audit Findings Table that follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that within the management system elements of its
            audit protocols there are conceptual linkages between sub-elements.
            As a result, a finding of non-compliance in a particular sub-element
            may necessarily result in multiple findings of non-compliance within
            each Program area.

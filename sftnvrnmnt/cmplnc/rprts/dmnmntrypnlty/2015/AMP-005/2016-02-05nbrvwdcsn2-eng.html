            Order XO-E101-016-2013 (Order), which granted Enbridge Pipelines
            Inc. (Enbridge) approval to construct and operate a new replacement
            pipeline between the Cromer Terminal and the tie-in point within
            NW-9-926 WPM.
          </p>
          <p>Condition 3 of the Order states:</p>
          <p class="mrgn-lft-lg">
            Enbridge shall implement or cause to be implemented all of the
            policies, practices, programs, mitigation measures, recommendations,
            procedures and its commitments for the protection of the environment
            included in or referred to in its application and its related
            submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pursuant to Part IX of the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act) and
            section 2(3) of the Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations
            (AMP Regulations), the Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP) Officer
            issued Notice of Violation AMP-005-2015 (NOV) to Enbridge on 23
            February 2015, for failure to comply with Condition&nbsp;3 of the
            Order by failing to implement measures committed to by Enbridge in
            its Environmental Protection Plan (EPP). The penalty was set in the
            amount of $100,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 25 March 2015, the Board received Enbridge&rsquo;s Request for
            Review of both the penalty amount and the facts of the violation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board issued a procedural letter on 10 April 2015, setting out
            the process through which the Request for Review would be
            considered. In accordance with this process, the Board received the
            AMP Officer&rsquo;s disclosure package (Disclosure) on 24 April 2015
            and Enbridge&rsquo;s submission dated 25 May 2015. The AMP Officer
            filed his response submission on 24 June 2015. Enbridge did not file
            a reply to the AMP Officer&rsquo;s response submission, an
            opportunity afforded by the Board&rsquo;s procedural letter.
          </p>
          <p>
            As noted above, Enbridge requested a review of both the penalty
            amount and the facts of the violation. The Board&rsquo;s decision in
            this matter, set out below, addresses the facts of the violation
            first, and the amount of the penalty second.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>DISPOSITION</strong></h3>
          <p>For the reasons that follow, the Board has determined that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Enbridge committed the violation; and</strong></li>
            <li>
              <strong

          <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
          <h4>The Facts of the Violation</h4>
          <h5>Views of the Parties</h5>
          <h6>The AMP Officer</h6>
          <p>
            In the NOV, the AMP Officer alleges that NEB Inspection Officers,
            during an inspection of the Project&rsquo;s Right of Way (RoW)
            conducted on 9 and 10 July 2014, observed that multiple
            environmental mitigation measures to which Enbridge had committed in
            its EPP to conserve topsoil, control erosion, control vegetation
            (including weeds) and manage drainage were not implemented.
            According to the AMP Officer, this lack of EPP implementation
            resulted in numerous non-compliances on and off construction RoW
            causing environmental damage to wetlands and property damage to a
            substantial amount of agricultural land.
          </p>
          <h6>Enbridge</h6>
          <p>
            Enbridge argues that the AMP Officer has not established, on a
            balance of probabilities, that Enbridge committed the violation in
            the manner described in the AMP as required by section 148 of the
            Act. Enbridge requests, pursuant to sections 144 and 147 of the
            NEB|Act, that the AMP be rescinded, or in the alternative, that the
            amount of thepenalty be reduced for the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>the Disclosure is incomplete in important respects;</li>
            <li>
              the adverse conclusions drawn, and aggravating factors applied in
              determining the gravity values referenced in the AMP are not
              supported by<br />
              the evidence that is provided in the Disclosure;
            </li>
            <li>
              the Missing Records show that the adverse conclusions drawn and
              aggravating factors applied in determining the gravity values
              referenced in<br />
              the AMP failed to consider relevant factors and evidence;
            </li>
            <li>
              breaches of procedural fairness and natural justice occurred
              during the July and August Inspections that prejudiced Enbridge;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              the $100,000 penalty does not comply with the stated intent of the
              Act or the principles of the AMP process.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Enbridge submits that the Disclosure is missing several documents
            and it is incomplete. As a result, Enbridge argues that the Board
            must conclude that the missing documents were not considered, which
            resulted in the AMP Officer failing to consider relevant facts when
            deciding to issue the AMP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge further submits that because of severe weather and flooding
            there was no feasible way to maintain the RoW in the same condition
            as when the construction was suspended in March 2014. According to
            Enbridge, in the light of the severe flooding in Cromer, the
            mitigation measures employed at the suspension of construction were
            in alignment with the EPP and were reasonable for the conditions of
            the RoW, and the phase of construction underway at that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge argues that it was following its EPP by shutting down
            construction activity on 20 March 2014 due to wet conditions
            associated with spring thaw. Enbridge states that &ldquo;after
            construction was suspended, and prior to the flooding, the RoW was
            inspected every two weeks to identify areas needing corrective work.
            In advance of the flooding, some areas had been identified that
            needed repair or erosion installations and Enbridge was able to make
            some of those corrections where foot access allowed until the time
            that flooding rendered the RoW inaccessible.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge states that it applied: the Wet/thawed Soils Contingency
            Plan by shutting down construction operations when the soil became
            too wet to continue working; the Soil Erosion Contingency Measures
            before leaving the RoW even though some of those measures were
            overcome by the unexpected flood conditions; the Siltation of
            Drainage or Wetlands Contingency Plan by suspending construction in
            March; and the Adverse Weather Contingency Plan for the Drainage
            Crossing, which withstood the flooding because erosion and
            sedimentation was not found to be an issue during the action plan
            assessment conducted in order to fulfil the work suspension order
            (Inspection Officer Order) issued by the Board inspector officer in
            relation to the Project.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Enbridge, the action plan developed by its third party
            contractor to address the Inspection Officer Order conditions did
            not note or confirm any non-compliances, as the AMP Officer alleges,
            and the action plan was designed to address the majority of the
            issues during the remainder of construction and final clean-up since
            the Project was mid-construction.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Inspection Report dated 9-10 June 2014, which is part of the
            Disclosure, listed non-compliances to 29 specific mitigation
            commitments from the EPP in the areas of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>soil handling;</li>
            <li>rutting;</li>

          <p>
            The Board, after reviewing all of the evidence on the record and
            submissions by the parties, finds that the AMP Officer has proved on
            a balance of probabilities that Enbridge has breached the following
            commitments made in the EPP regarding:

          <h4>Penalty Amount</h4>
          <h5>Background</h5>
          <p>
            In the NOV, the AMP Officer applied different gravity levels to the
            criteria as set out in the table in section 4 of the Administrative
            Monetary Penalties Regulations (National Energy Board):
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Other violations in the previous seven years: &ldquo;+1;&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>
              Any competitive or economic benefit from violation:&rdquo;
              0;&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>
              Reasonable efforts to mitigate/reverse the violation&rsquo;s
              effects: &ldquo;-1;&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>
              Negligence on the part of person who committed violation:
              &ldquo;+1;&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>
              Reasonable assistance to Board with respect to the violation:
              &ldquo;+1;&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>Promptly reported violation to Board: &ldquo;+2;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>
              Steps taken to prevent reoccurrence of violation:&rdquo;
              -1;&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>
              Violation was primarily reporting/record-keeping failure:
              &ldquo;0;&rdquo; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Any aggravating factors in relation to risk of harm to people or
              environment: &ldquo;+2.&rdquo;
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The total gravity factor of &ldquo;+5&rdquo; resulted in a penalty
            amount of $100,000.00, which is the maximum daily penalty that may
            be determined in accordance with the NEB Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge is disputing the gravity values ascribed to criteria number
            4 (negligence), 5 (reasonable assistance) and 9 (any aggravating
            factors) in the NOV. The Board has examined all the criteria and
            finds the gravity factors ascribed to criteria 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8
            are appropriate. The Board will deal with the disputed gravity
            factors below.
          </p>
          <h4>Negligence on the part of person who committed violation</h4>
          <h5>Views of the Parties</h5>
          <p>
            In the NOV, the AMP Officer applied a gravity value of
            &ldquo;+1,&rdquo; stating that &ldquo;Enbridge was negligent in its
            commitments relating to environmental protection as outlined in its
            EPP as it did not take all reasonable steps to prevent environmental
            damage.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge stated that it was not negligent in applying the EPP for
            the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the February  inspection by the NEB confirmed the implementation
              of the EPP as evidenced in the February inspection report
              Inspection Report with three exceptions;
            </li>
            <li>
              Enbridge maintained regular environmental inspections during
              construction and when construction was suspended;
            </li>
            <li>
              Although environmental issues were identified prior to the
              flooding and during the temporary suspension of construction,
              Enbridge could not access many areas of the land due to the
              saturated topsoil;
            </li>
            <li>
              From the March 2014 construction shut-down to the July inspection,
              Enbridge could not access lands for the purpose of removing
              sedimentation from topsoil, off-RoW or wetlands because it was too
              wet; water levels were high and soils were saturated; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Some mitigation measures were overcome by the heavy rains and
              flooding, causing some issues along the RoW that Enbridge was
              aware of and planned to remediate as soon as conditions were dry
              enough to permit access.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Views of the Board</h5>
          <p>
            While the defence of due diligence is expressly inapplicable to the
            commission of the violation pursuant to subsection 140(1)(a) of the
            NEB Act, the Board may consider it an available defence to the
            aggravating criterion of negligence on the part of the person who
            committed the violation. It is open to the person who committed the
            violation to prove that all due care was taken since that person
            alone has knowledge of what was done to avoid the breach, and it is
            not improper to expect that person to come forward with evidence of
            due diligence.<sup id="fnb1-ref"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fnb1"
                ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a
              ></sup
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case at hand, the EPP contains a variety of measures to
            prevent erosion control and sedimentation into sensitive
            watercourses and wetlands, including the Siltation Contingency Plan
            that requires installation of additional measures in the event an
            extreme precipitation event threatens. There is no evidence on
            record that these additional measures were implemented prior to the
            extreme rains and significant erosion along the RoW and
            sedimentation into wetlands occurred. There is also no evidence on
            the record to show that during most periods between March and July,
            access by some means was not possible, nor that reasonable steps
            were taken, to carry out monitoring and complete some necessary
            repairs or installations. In any event, it would have been
            reasonable to expect Enbridge to notify the Board of all of these
            difficulties in its required updates. Therefore, there is no
            evidence on the record which would demonstrate that Enbridge
            exercised due diligence with respect to its EPP commitments relating
            to environmental protection in the course of committing the
            violation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the above, the Board finds that the gravity value for this
            criterion was applied appropriately.
          </p>
          <h4>
            <strong
              >Reasonable assistance to Board with respect to the
              violation</strong
            >
          </h4>
          <p><strong>Views of the Parties</strong></p>
          <p>
            In the NOV, the AMP Officer applied a gravity value of
            &ldquo;+1,&rdquo; stating that &ldquo;Enbridge responded to
            landowner environmental concerns noted above only when required to
            do so by the Inspection Officer Order.&rdquo;   Enbridge asserts the
            factor 5 relates to the provision of reasonable assistance to the
            Board, and not to the landowner. Enbridge also argued that it did
            provide assistance to the Board, before and after the commission of
            the violation, as reflected by the NEB staff thanking Enbridge for
            the assistance provided in the February, July and November
            Inspection Reports.  In response, the AMP Officer recommended that
            this gravity value be adjusted to &ldquo;0,&rdquo; to reflect the
            absence of mitigating or aggravating actions regarding this
            criterion.
          </p>
          <h5>Views of the Board</h5>
          <p>
            The Board agrees with Enbridge that this criterion relates to the
            assistance provided to the Board, and not to third parties. The
            Board notes that the application of this criterion requires
            consideration of both the aggravating and mitigating actions
            specific to the circumstances of each case. The Board also notes
            that this criterion requires an inquiry into the assistance provided
            after the commission of the violation and not before. Consequently,
            the actions taken by Enbridge leading up to the violation are not
            relevant to the application and assessment of this criterion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board finds that following the July inspection, Enbridge did
            submit documentation as required to meet the conditions of the
            Inspection Officer Order, and maintained regular correspondence with
            Board staff and the Inspection Officer regarding mitigation measures
            relating to the Inspection Officer Order. Enbridge also participated
            in a follow-up environment inspection with NEB Inspectors in August.
            However, the Board is of the view that meeting the conditions of an
            Inspection Officer Order is a regulatory requirement and finds that
            the assistance provided to the Board following the violation met
            only the Board&rsquo;s minimum compliance requirements that all
            NEB-regulated companies must fulfill. The Board finds that the
            assistance provided by Enbridge with respect to the violation does
            not warrant a mitigating factor being applied, and therefore
            ascribes a gravity value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; to this criterion.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Any aggravating factors in relation to risk of harm to people or
            environment
          </h4>
          <h5>Views of the Parties</h5>
          <p>
            In the NOV, the AMP Officer applied a gravity value of
            &ldquo;+2,&rdquo; stating that &ldquo;NEB inspection found that a
            lack of EPP implementation resulted in numerous non-compliances
            observed both on and off the construction RoW causing significant
            environmental damage to wetlands and property damage to a
            substantial amount of agricultural land. Specific non-compliances
            included improper soil handling, rutting, weed control, and erosion
            posing a significant hazard to the environment. The non-compliances
            observed by NEB staff were confirmed by a 3rd Party Consultant
            Enbridge&rsquo;s Action Plan submitted on 31 July 2014.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Enbridge asserts that it put forth great effort to implement the
            EPP, and that any deficiencies were not due to lack of EPP
            implementation or negligence, but caused by severe flooding
            experienced on the construction footprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response, the AMP Officer states that the aggravating factor of
            +2 was applied due to evidence of significant environmental damage
            observed during the July inspection, and Enbridge&rsquo;s
            non-compliance with mitigation measures outlined in its own project
            EPP.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>Views of the Board </strong></h5>
          <p>
            Criterion 9 specifically refers to the risk of harm to people or the
            environment, having regard to the circumstances of the violation,
            rather than any efforts on the part of the violator.  The Board is
            of the view that Enbridge&rsquo;s failure to implement mitigation
            measures, in particular those relating to soil handling, erosion and
            sediment control and drainage control, resulted in increased risk of
            harm to the environment. The Board finds that at the time of the
            July Inspection, risk to the environmental had materialized and
            environmental damage had occurred, including significant erosion and
            admixing of topsoil and subsoil, ponding throughout the RoW,
            substantial amounts of sedimentation in various wetlands and
            migration of soils on and off of the Project RoW.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board notes that following the violation, and in response to the
            Inspection Officer Order conditions, Enbridge submitted an Action
            Plan to address environmental issues, and adopted this Action Plan
            into its EPP for the Project. The Board finds that although there
            was risk of harm to people or the environment, the risk was
            localized and would likely have been mitigated through
            implementation of the measures specified in the Action Plan and EPP
            for the Project. Accordingly, the Board reduces the gravity value to
            &ldquo;+1&rdquo; for this criterion.
          </p>

            <strong
              >Consequently, the total gravity value is adjusted to

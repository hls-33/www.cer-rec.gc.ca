<h2 id="fwrd">Foreword</h2>
<p>The National Energy Board (the NEB or the Board) is responsible for the regulation of natural gas, oil and commodity pipelines that cross a provincial or international border; it does so through the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and its regulations. The Board is committed to ensuring the continued safe and reliable operation of Canada&rsquo;s pipeline infrastructure that falls under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This guidance is provided to assist interested parties in understanding the requirements of the NEB&rsquo;s regulations for pipeline damage prevention for crossing of pipelines with agricultural vehicles or mobile equipment. This guidance is not a substitute for the NEB Act or any regulations made thereunder including the damage prevention regulations or any other applicable legislation. To the extent there is any inconsistency between this guidance and the NEB Act or its regulations, or any other applicable legislation, the legislation is paramount.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NEB&rsquo;s regulations for pipeline damage prevention is to ensure the safety of all persons living or working near pipelines. The regulations provide a framework to allow activities near pipelines to occur if they can be conducted safely.</p>
<p>The NEB is committed to continual improvement of the regulatory framework for pipeline damage prevention. Should you have any questions or feedback on this guidance, please send them to <a href="mailto:DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca">DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca</a>.</p>

<p>The requirements that must be met for crossing the pipeline to be authorized, including crossings for agricultural activities, are located in the <em>DPR &ndash; Authorizations</em>, sections&nbsp;12 and 13, and the corresponding responsibilities of the pipeline companies are located in section&nbsp;7 of the <em>DPR &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Guidance for Safe Crossings of NEB-Regulated Pipelines Using Agricultural Vehicles and Mobile Equipment </em>published in 2010 has been updated to reflect the changes made to the NEB Act and its damage prevention provisions through the <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> in 2016, and related updates to the NEB&rsquo;s regulations for pipeline damage prevention.</p>

Safe crossing of buried pipelines involves many factors. These factors are subject to a number of standards and government regulations developed on the basis of best available science, engineering practices, and experience.</p>
<p> The factors that affect pipeline safety can be complex and include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of activities being conducted,</li>
<li>Type and size of equipment,</li>
<li>Soil conditions,</li>
<li>Frequency of the crossing activity,</li>
<li>Pipeline system specifications and design,</li>
<li>Pipeline operating conditions, and</li>

<h2 id="s2">2. Guidance for safe crossings of NEB-regulated pipelines using agricultural vehicles and mobile equipment</h2>
<h3 id="s2_1">2.1 Agricultural crossings &ndash; consent NOT required</h3>
<p>The <em>DPR &ndash; Authorizations</em> provides that persons operating agricultural vehicles or mobile equipment across pipelines may do so in low-risk areas, under certain conditions (section&nbsp;13).</p>
<p>The operation across the pipeline of a vehicle or mobile equipment that is used for an agricultural activity is authorized if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>the loaded axle weight and tire pressures of the vehicle or mobile equipment are within the manufac­turer&rsquo;s approved limits and operating guidelines; and</li>
<li>the point of crossing has not been the subject of a notification from the pipeline company that crossing at that location could impair the pipeline&rsquo;s safety or security.</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to vehicles or mobile equipment used for agricultural activities in the production of crops and the raising of animals and includes pasturing and cultivation activities such as tillage, plowing, disking and harrowing.</p>
<p>Pipeline companies have the responsibility to identify the site-specific locations of the pipeline where such crossings could impair the pipeline&rsquo;s safety or security. The pipeline company must identify those locations and notify the affected persons in writing of those locations (<em>DPR &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em>, section&nbsp;7).</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If landowners/users are unsure if all of the above conditions will be met in relation to the proposed agricultural activity or are unsure if the proposed agricultural activity could jeopardize the safe and secure operation of the pipeline, they must contact the pipeline company before crossing the pipeline with agricultural vehicles or mobile equipment.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Agricultural crossings &ndash; consent IS required</h3>
<p>Landowners/users must obtain written consent from the pipeline company before conducting crossings in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li>the crossing is not for the purpose of an agricultural activity;</li>
<li>for crossings for the purpose of agricultural activities, the requirements regarding loaded axle weight and tire pressures cannot be met;</li>
<li>for crossings for the purpose of agricultural activities, the point of crossing has been the subject of a notification from the pipeline company that a crossing for at that location could impair the pipeline&rsquo;s safety or security.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pipeline company has 10 working days to inform a person requesting consent for crossing the pipeline and the pipeline right of way with an agricultural vehicle whether it consents to the crossing. Should the pipeline company refuse to provide consent, the company will provide the person making the request with the reasons for its denial.</p>
<p>Pipeline companies are required to manage vehicle crossings on the pipeline. Their damage prevention programs, as required in the <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em>, should identify vehicles that pose a hazard and those that do not pose a hazard to the pipeline, and manage them accordingly. If necessary, the pipeline company may request that the location of the crossing be moved or reinforced in some manner to prevent damage.</p>
<p>A thorough assessment of pipeline safety requires detailed knowledge about ground conditions, design factors and operating characteristics. For these reasons, pipeline companies and landowners or land users need to work together to make crossing assessments.</p>
<p>If you are unable to obtain the consent of the pipeline company for the crossing, you may file an application with the Board. You can find information in Guide C of the NEB&rsquo;s Filing Manual about how to make an application for a pipeline crossing. You can also contact the NEB toll free by telephone at 1-800-899-1265 or by email at <a href="mailto:DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca">DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca</a>. For information on how to make an application, see section&nbsp;2.4.</p>
<h3 id="s2_3">2.3 Ground disturbance activity near the pipeline &ndash; consent IS required</h3>
<p>Note that while crossing a pipeline with a vehicle that is used for an agricultural activity is authorized if it meets the requirements in section&nbsp;2.1, if it is causing a ground disturbance in the prescribed area (30 metres measured perpendicularly from either side of the centreline of the pipe), that ground disturbance activity must also be authorized.</p>
<p>The following are not considered ground disturbances under the NEB Act and therefore do not have to meet the requirements for authorization of ground disturbance activities, including pipeline company consent:</p>
<ul>
<li>cultivation to a depth of less than 45&nbsp;cm below the surface of the ground</li>
<li>activity to a depth of less than 30&nbsp;cm and that does not result in a reduction of the earth cover over the pipeline to a depth that is less than the cover provided when the pipeline was constructed</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of agricultural activities that cause a ground disturbance that may not fall within the above exclusions and thus require consent from the pipeline company include, but are not limited to: stumping, sub-soiling, chisel plowing, terracing, drain tile excavating, driving posts, rotation of fences, leveling operations that change the pipeline depth of cover, and deep mechanical planting/harvesting.</p>
<p>If an activity involves the disturbance of the ground and does not fall within the above-referenced categories, the person planning the activity must meet the requirements outlined in <em>DPR &ndash; Authorizations, </em>which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>contacting the pipeline company and obtaining written consent</li>
<li>making a locate request</li>
<li>following the safety requirements in the regulations and provided by the pipeline company</li>
</ul>
<div class="well well-sm text-center">
<h4 class="h4 mrgn-tp-sm">Did You Know?</h4>
<p><strong>Pipeline signs and marker posts do not indicate the exact location of the pipe within the right of way.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ALWAYS click, or call, before you dig!</strong></p>
<p>You can access the nearest one-call centre to make a locate request anywhere in Canada at<br>
<a href="http://www.clickbeforeyoudig.com/" rel="external">http://www.clickbeforeyoudig.com/</a></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p>The pipeline company has 10&nbsp;working days to inform a person requesting consent to undertake an activity causing a ground disturbance whether it consents to the activity. Should the pipeline company refuse to provide consent, the company will provide the person making the request with the reasons for its denial.</p>
<p>If the pipeline company has provided written consent for an activity causing a ground disturbance, the person planning the activity must make a locate request to a one-call centre, or to the pipeline company directly where one-call centres do not exist. The locate request must be made at least three working days before the day on which the ground disturbance activity is to start. The company must locate the pipe within three working days after the date of the request. This period of time may be extended if both you and the pipeline company agree.</p>
<p>The pipeline company must: locate its pipe; place surface markings to identify its location; and provide the safety practices to be followed (in a written format) and information that clearly explains the significance of the markings to the person planning to conduct a ground disturbance. The person conducting the ground disturbance activity must follow the safety measures in the regulations and in the company&rsquo;s written consent. For safety purposes, you must follow the instructions of the pipeline company&rsquo;s authorized field representative when conducting the activity.</p>
<p>If you are planning to conduct a ground disturbance or construction activity, or to operate a vehicle across a pipeline, you must inform anyone working on your behalf, including employees, contractors and subcontractors, of their obligations under the <em>DPR &ndash; Authorizations</em>.</p>
<p>If you are unable to obtain the consent of the pipeline company or you cannot meet the safety measures outlined in the regulations or by the company, you may file an application with the Board. You can find information in Guide C of the NEB&rsquo;s Filing Manual about how to make an application to conduct a ground disturbance activity. You can also contact the NEB by telephone at toll free 1-800-899-1265 or by email at <a href="mailto:DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca">DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca</a>. For information on how to make an application, see section&nbsp;2.4.</p>

<h3 id="s2_4">2.4 How to apply for authorization from the National Energy Board</h3>
<p><img src="/sftnvrnmnt/dmgprvntn/mg/crssngs/mg03.jpg" alt="landowner and child pointing to farm equipment in a field" width="250" class="pull-right ">An application to the Board for authorization is a letter or document that should include the location and full details of the proposed activity. The Board&rsquo;s Filing Manual provides guidance regarding the type of information the Board would typically need for a section&nbsp;112 application, including information on the purpose and location of the activity, and the rationale for seeking approval from the Board. The applicant is requested to provide as much information as possible about the efforts made to obtain the pipeline company&rsquo;s consent for the activity prior to making the application to the Board, including the reasons given by the pipeline company for withholding its consent.</p>

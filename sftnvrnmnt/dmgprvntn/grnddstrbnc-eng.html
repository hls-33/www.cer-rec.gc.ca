<h2 id="s1">1. National Energy Board Regulations</h2>
<p>The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) takes all available actions to protect Canadians and the environment. As a result of on-going regulatory efforts and continued monitoring, pipelines continue to be a safe method to transport products, such as natural gas, oil or other commodities, across the country.</p>
<p><img src="/sftnvrnmnt/dmgprvntn/mg/grnddstrbnc/mg04.jpg" alt="Field inspection" width="250" class="pull-right mrgn-lft-md">Preventing damage to pipelines is a shared responsibility. Pipeline companies and anyone living or working near pipelines have an important role to ensure that activities near pipelines are conducted safely. The <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (the NEB Act) and its regulations define the responsibilities of both pipeline companies and anyone planning to conduct an activity near a pipeline. It is often human error that causes damage to pipelines that may put your safety, your community and the environment at risk. Please be aware of pipelines and always click or call before you dig!</p>
<p>The purpose of the NEB&rsquo;s regulations for pipeline damage prevention is to ensure the safety of all persons living or working near pipelines. The regulations provide a framework to allow activities near pipelines to occur if they can be conducted safely.</p>
<p>The NEB is committed to continual improvement of the regulatory framework for pipeline damage prevention. Should you have any questions or feedback on this guidance, please send them to <a href="mailto:DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca">DPinfo@cer-rec.gc.ca</a>.</p>

<h3 id="s1_2">The National Energy Board Regulations for Pipeline Damage Prevention</h3>
<p>Experience has shown that many pipeline incidents are caused by contractors or others working near the pipeline. Unsafe construction and ground disturbance practices can damage a pipeline and the environment, sometimes resulting in injury or death to construction company workers and bystanders. In addition to the dangers to people and the environment, such damage can lead to expensive repairs as well as a loss of revenue and essential services.</p>
<p>The NEB is focused on the safety of pipelines under its jurisdiction. Under section&nbsp;112 and section&nbsp;48(2) of the NEB Act, the NEB developed the <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations – Authorizations </em>(<em>DPR – Authorizations</em>)and <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations – Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em> (<em>DPR – Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em>) (the Regulations). Following these regulations will reduce the likelihood of damage to pipeline company facilities and enable you to complete your project safely and legally.</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p><strong>&ldquo;Pipeline&rdquo; in <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/n-7/section-2.html" rel="external">section&nbsp;2</a> of the NEB Act is defined as follows: &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; means a line that is used or to be used for the transmission of oil, gas or any other commodity and that connects a province with any other province or provinces or extends beyond the limits of a province or the offshore area as defined in <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/n-7/section-123.html" rel="external">section&nbsp;123</a>, and includes all branches, extensions, tanks, reservoirs, storage facilities, pumps, racks, compressors, loading facilities, interstation systems of communication by telephone, telegraph or radio and real and personal property, or immovable and movable, and works connected to them, but does not include a sewer or water pipeline that is used or proposed to be used solely for municipal purposes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Pipe&rdquo; in section&nbsp;2 of the <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations – Authorizations</em> means a pipe that is part of a pipeline and that is used or is to be used for the transmission of hydrocarbons or any other commodity.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4 id="s1_2_1">Who is Affected by the Regulations?</h4>
<p>Under section&nbsp;112 of the NEB Act, the following are prohibited unless authorized through the Regulations or a Board order: ground disturbance activities within the prescribed area; facility construction across, on, along or under a pipeline; and vehicle crossings of a pipeline.</p>
<p>The <em>DPR – Authorizations</em> applies to anyone who will be: undertaking an activity that causes a ground disturbance in the prescribed area, which extends 30&nbsp;metres perpendicularly on either side from the centreline of the pipe (<em>DPR – Authorizations</em>, section&nbsp;2); constructing a facility across, on, along, or under a pipeline; or crossing a pipeline (which includes the right-of-way) with a vehicle or mobile equipment. Activities to a depth less than 30&nbsp;cm that do not reduce the total cover over the pipe at the time of construction and cultivation to less than 45&nbsp;cm are not considered ground disturbance (NEB Act, section&nbsp;2).</p>
<p>The <em>DPR – Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em> sets out responsibilities of pipeline companies concerning proposed ground disturbance activities, construction near pipelines and vehicle crossings. The NEB requires companies to anticipate, prevent, manage and mitigate potentially dangerous conditions associated with their pipelines.
</p>
<h4 id="s1_2_2">What is a Ground Disturbance Activity?</h4>
<p>Under section&nbsp;2 of the NEB Act, ground disturbance does not include:</p>
<ul>
<li>cultivation to a depth of less than 45&nbsp;cm below the surface of the ground</li>
<li>any activity to a depth of less than 30&nbsp;cm and that does not result in reduction of the depth of earth cover over the pipeline less than that approved at time of construction</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities causing ground disturbance can include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<h4 id="s1_2_3">What is the Prescribed Area?</h4>
<p>The <em>DPR – Authorizations</em> provides that the prescribed area extends 30&nbsp;metres perpendicularly in both directions from the centreline of a pipe. The intent of the prescribed area is to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>the protection of pipelines from damage that may result from activities causing ground disturbance; and</li>
<li>the safety of all persons living or working near the pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="s1_2_5">Which Pipelines are under National Energy Board Jurisdiction?</h4>
<p>In general, the NEB regulates natural gas, oil, and commodity pipelines that extend beyond provincial, territorial or national boundaries.</p>
<h4 id="s1_2_6">What Do the Regulations Provide?</h4>
<p>The <em>DPR – Authorizations</em> explains the legal conditions under which ground disturbance in the prescribed area and construction of facilities near the pipeline (including the right of way) can be conducted safely. It also provides the requirements for authorization to cross a pipeline (including the right of way) with a vehicle or mobile equipment. The <em>DPR – Obligations</em> <em>of Pipeline Companies </em>outlines responsibilities of the pipeline company to you and the NEB.</p>
<p>If you cannot meet all the requirements of the Regulations, including obtaining the pipeline company&rsquo;s consent, you can apply to the Board for an order authorizing the ground disturbance activity.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the Regulations, contact the NEB. Contact information is included in <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a> of this guide.</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p><strong>It is illegal to proceed with: unauthorized construction of a facility across, on, along or under a right of way; unauthorized ground disturbance activity within the 30&nbsp;metre (100&nbsp;foot) prescribed area; or unauthorized vehicle or mobile equipment crossings.</strong></p>

<h2 id="s2">2. Obtaining Consent</h2>
<h3 id="s2_1">What Activities Require Consent from the Pipeline Company?</h3>
<p>Consent from the pipeline company is required for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction of a facility across, on, along, or under a pipeline (including the right of way);</li>
<li>Ground disturbance activities in the prescribed area, which extends 30&nbsp;metres (100&nbsp;feet) from each side of the centreline of the pipe; and</li>
<li>Operation of a vehicle or mobile equipment across a right of way, outside the travelled portion of a highway or public road.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s2_2">What Activities Do Not Require Consent?</h3>
<h4>Overhead Lines</h4>
<ul>
<li>While consent of the pipeline company is not required to construct an overhead line across a pipeline (assuming that ground disturbances do not occur in the prescribed area or that the construction does not involve vehicle or mobile equipment crossing), a person constructing an overhead line across the pipeline ROW must, prior to construction: obtain from the pipeline company the safety practices to be followed while working in the vicinity of its pipes; make a locate request; and wait for the pipeline company to mark their pipeline and explain the significance of those markings.</li>
<li>Any person undertaking the construction of an overhead line across a pipeline must also comply with the applicable federal and provincial laws for the construction of the overhead lines. Ground to wire clearances are determined by a number of factors addressed in applicable codes and standards for the construction of overhead lines.</li>
<li>Aerial warning devices must be installed and maintained by the person constructing the overhead line where it crosses the pipeline, if the pipeline is patrolled by aircraft, for the safety of pipeline company employees, the public and the pipeline.</li>
<li>Poles, pylons, towers, guys, anchors or supporting structures must not be constructed or placed across, on, along or under the pipeline. If a third party proposes to place such structures on the pipeline ROW, separate authorization must be obtained in accordance with the procedures outlined in the other sections&nbsp;of the <em>DPR – Authorizations</em>, including section&nbsp;7 and section&nbsp;10.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Maintenance of an Existing Facility</h4>
<ul>
<li>If maintenance of an existing facility in the prescribed area causes a ground disturbance, the person engaged in the maintenance must make a locate request in accordance with section&nbsp;3 of <em>DPR – Authorizations</em> and obtain the necessary information from the pipeline company, including written safety practices, and an explanation of the markings made as a result of the locate request. If performing mechanical excavation within 3&nbsp;metres of the pipe, the person engaged in the maintenance must follow the requirements for such excavation outlined in paragraph&nbsp;10(3)(c) of <em>DPR – Authorizations</em>.</li>
<li>The person engaged in the maintenance must also comply with the instructions of the pipeline company&rsquo;s authorized field representative regarding the procedures that are to be followed during the activity and that relate to the pipeline&rsquo;s safety and security.</li>
<li>If interference with or alteration of a pipe becomes necessary, the person engaged in the maintenance must obtain the pipeline company&rsquo;s written consent to interfere with or alter the pipe.</li>
<li>The person engaged in the maintenance must carry out any activity that involves the interference with or alteration of a pipe under the pipeline company&rsquo;s supervision. As well, the person engaged in the maintenance must immediately notify the pipeline company of any contact with a pipe or its coating during the activity.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise agreed on by the pipeline company and the person that is engaged in the activity, the facility owner must notify the pipeline company at least 24 hours before backfilling over a pipe.</li>
<li>See &ldquo;Your Field Responsibilities&rdquo; in this guidance for further information.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Crossing a Pipeline with an Agricultural Vehicle or Mobile Equipment</h4>
<p>The <em>DPR – Authorizations</em> provides that persons operating agricultural vehicles or mobile equipment across pipelines may do so in low-risk areas, under certain conditions.</p>
<p> The operation across the pipeline of a vehicle or mobile equipment that is used for an agricultural activity is authorized if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>the loaded axle weight and tire pressures of the vehicle or mobile equipment are within the manufac­turer&rsquo;s approved limits and operating guidelines; and</li>
<li>the point of crossing has not been the subject of a notification from the pipeline company that crossing at that location could impair the pipeline&rsquo;s safety or security.</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to vehicles or mobile equipment used for agricultural activities in the production of crops and the raising of animals and includes pasturing and cultivation activities such as tillage, plowing, disking and harrowing.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts, please contact the applicable pipeline company or the NEB (see <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a> for NEB contact information).</p>
<h3 id="s2_3">How to Obtain Consent from the Pipeline Company</h3>
<ol>
<li>Contact the pipeline company for a copy of their technical guidelines. These guidelines set out the information you need to include in your application to the pipeline company.</li>
<li>Prepare your request for consent following the pipeline company&rsquo;s guidelines.</li>
<li>If you have any questions pertaining to your project, contact the pipeline company <strong>before</strong> you submit your request for consent. They will discuss your project with you and, if necessary, provide assistance.</li>
<li>Submit your request for consent to the pipeline company.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within ten&nbsp;working days of receiving your request, the pipeline company must either give you its consent or provide reasons for denying it. <strong>If consent is denied, you may apply to the NEB for a review of your request under the NEB Act (section&nbsp;112) and the <em>DPR – Authorizations</em> (section&nbsp;14).</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to change the design, location, or type of facilities to be constructed <strong>after</strong> the pipeline company gives its consent, the pipeline company must agree to the changes <strong>before</strong> you start your work.
</p>
<h3 id="s2_4">Is There a Time Limit?</h3>
<p>In general, the pipeline company&rsquo;s consent will lapse if all work is not completed within two years of the date that consent was given. However, this time limit may be changed if you and the pipeline company agree.</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p class="text-center"><strong>The pipeline company may suspend the consent given if technical details and conditions are not followed or unsafe construction practices are used (<em>DPR – Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em>, section&nbsp;10). The NEB may order work to stop if the Board considers it necessary for the safety and security of the pipeline.</strong></p>
</div>
<h3 id="s2_5">When Do You Require Approval from the National Energy Board?</h3>
<p>If you cannot obtain the pipeline company&rsquo;s consent or you cannot comply with all the requirements in the Regulations, you must obtain the NEB&rsquo;s approval before starting: construction of a facility across, on, along, or under pipeline (including the right of way); any ground disturbance activity in the prescribed area (30&nbsp;metres from either side of the centreline of the pipe); or the operation of a vehicle or mobile equipment across the pipeline (including the right of way).</p>
<p> You will also have to ask the NEB for its approval if:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>You cannot meet the conditions required by the pipeline company</li>
<li>The pipeline company has suspended and not reinstated its consent for your proposed activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Mining activities within 40&nbsp;metres of a pipeline right of way require consent from the NEB (see NEB Act, section&nbsp;81).</p>
<h3 id="s2_6">How to Apply to the National Energy Board for Authorization </h3>

<p>An application to the Board for authorization is a letter or document that should include the location and full details of the proposed activity. The Board&rsquo;s Filing Manual provides guidance regarding the type of information the Board would typically need for a section&nbsp;112 application, including information on the purpose and location of the activity, and the rationale for seeking approval from the Board. The applicant is requested to provide as much information as possible about the efforts made to obtain the pipeline company&rsquo;s consent for the activity prior to making the application to the Board, including the reasons given by the pipeline company for withholding its consent.</p>
<p>The Filing Manual can be accessed online at www.neb-one.gc.ca. The Filing Manual is also available from the Board&rsquo;s Library by calling 1-800-899-1265.</p>

<h2 id="s3">3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
<h3 id="s3_1">Your Field Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Please refer to the <em>DPR - Authorizations</em> for all third party responsibilities (see <a href="#nnx4">Appendix&nbsp;4</a>).</p>
<p>Once the pipeline company has given its written consent, you must follow these steps to comply with the Regulations.</p>
<p><strong>1. For the construction of a facility or ground disturbance activity, contact a one-call centre</strong></p>
<p>You must contact a one-call centre, or the pipeline company directly if one call services are not available in your area, to submit a locate request at least three working days before starting any work (except in the case of emergencies). The company must locate the pipe within three working days after the date of the request. This period of time may be extended if both you and the pipeline company agree.</p>
<p>Confirmation must be received from the pipeline company that all of the pipeline company&rsquo;s pipes in the vicinity of the construction or ground disturbance have been marked and the pipeline company must have clearly explained the significance of the markings to you. You must also receive written information from the pipeline company regarding the safety practices to be followed while working in the vicinity of its pipe or in the prescribed area. A misunderstanding could cause you to damage a pipe, endangering your own life and that of others.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Follow the instructions of the pipeline company</strong></p>
<p>After written consent is obtained, and work is to start, you must comply with the safety measures in the company&rsquo;s consent, the regulations, and the instructions of the pipeline company&rsquo;s authorized field representative regarding the procedures that are to be followed while carrying out the ground disturbance activity in the prescribed area. This includes stopping the work if it may impair the pipeline&rsquo;s safety or security.</p>
<p><strong>3. Duty to inform</strong></p>
<p>If you are planning to conduct a ground disturbance or construction activity, or to operate a vehicle across a pipeline, you must inform anyone working on your behalf, including employees, contractors and subcontractors, of their obligations under the <em>DPR – Authorizations</em>.</p>
<p>If you are renting out your land, you will want to talk to your tenants about the <em>DPR – Authorizations</em> as they will also be expected to abide by them.</p>
<p><strong>4. Provide notice for backfilling and report any damage immediately</strong></p>
<p>You must provide the pipeline company with 24 hours&rsquo; notice before backfilling over the pipe. <strong>Any contact with the pipe or its coating must be reported to the pipeline company immediately as well as any other damage that may have occurred. </strong>Even incidents which seem minor at the time – small dents and scratches on the pipe or any damage to the coating – could lead to serious problems such as corrosion which could eventually cause the pipe to rupture.</p>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p class="text-center"><strong>At no time are you allowed to move or alter the pipe or its fittings, or in any other way interfere with the pipe <br>
  without the written consent of the pipeline company, <br>
  and then only if the work is done under its direct supervision.<br>
</strong><span class="nowrap">(See <em>DPR – Authorizations</em>,</span> paragraphs 10&nbsp;(3)(e) and&nbsp;(f))</p>
</div>
<p><strong>5. Observe the temporary prohibition area</strong></p>
<p>The temporary prohibition area differs from and should not be confused with the 30&nbsp;metre (100&nbsp;feet) prescribed area. When a pipeline company receives a locate request for a ground disturbance activity, they may designate a temporary prohibition area in the vicinity of the pipeline which may extend beyond the 30&nbsp;metre prescribed area. This may occur when there are situations where a ground disturbance activity outside of the prescribed area may pose a potential hazard to the pipe. When a temporary prohibition area is designated, no ground disturbance activity may be performed in this area until:</p>
<ul>
<li>the end of the third working day after the day on which the request is made; or</li>
<li>at any later time that is agreed to between the pipeline company and the person making the request.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Follow the rules for mechanical excavation within three&nbsp;metres of the pipe</strong></p>
<p>(See <em>DPR – Authorizations</em>, paragraph&nbsp;10(3)(c)) <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Ground disturbance using mechanical equipment is not permitted within three&nbsp;metres (10&nbsp;feet) of the pipe unless:</p>
<ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
<li>if the excavation runs parallel to the pipe, the pipe has been exposed by hand at sufficient intervals to confirm the pipe’s location or the pipeline company has used a method that would permit it to confirm the pipe’s exact location and has informed the person of that location,</li>
<li>if the excavation crosses the pipe, the pipe has been exposed by hand at the point of crossing or the pipeline company has used a method that would permit it to confirm the pipe&rsquo;s exact location, has informed the person of that location and has confirmed that the pipe is at least 60&nbsp;cm deeper than the proposed excavation, and</li>
<li>if ground conditions render it impractical to locate the pipe using any of the methods set out in (i) and (ii), the pipeline company directly supervises any excavation.</li>
</ol>
<p>When boring directionally or using explosives, you must meet the pipeline company&rsquo;s conditions.</p>
<p><strong>7. Comply with the pipeline company’s conditions/instructions or the conditions of a Board approval</strong></p>
<p>The pipeline company may have made its consent conditional on meeting certain requirements. You must comply with the company&rsquo;s conditions, as well as with the instructions of any authorized pipeline company field representative regarding procedures when working near the pipeline.</p>
<p>If the Board has approved the activity, you must comply with the conditions outlined in the Board&rsquo;s order.</p>
<h3 id="s3_2">Your Responsibilities After Construction</h3>
<p>(See <em>DPR – Authorizations</em>, sections&nbsp;8 and&nbsp;11)</p>
<p>If you are the owner of the facility that is constructed across, on, along or under a pipeline, you must maintain the facility in good condition so that it will not impact the safety of the pipeline. This remains your responsibility until you can show that someone else has taken over the ownership of the facility, or until it has been removed or abandoned in a manner that does not adversely affect the pipeline&rsquo;s safety and security or jeopardize property and the environment and the safety and security of the public and of the pipeline company&rsquo;s employees.</p>
<p>Facility owners must contact the one-call centre or the pipeline company directly prior to any maintenance activities that could cause a ground disturbance in the prescribed area; for further information regarding requirements for maintenance activities, see section&nbsp;11 of <em>DPR – Authorizations</em>.</p>
<p>If you decide to remove or abandon the facility, you must notify the pipeline company in writing before doing so. You must also remove or alter your facility if it is determined that it could adversely affect the safe and efficient operation of the pipeline. The NEB may require you to remove or alter your facility if it determines that it is necessary. When removing your facility, any ground disturbance required would have to be authorized. If you are abandoning your facility, the pipeline company may require that you take precautions to ensure that deterioration of the facility does not become a hazard to the safety of the pipe.</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2 id="s4">4. Unauthorized Activities</h2>
<p>The following are examples of unauthorized activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>a ground disturbance within the prescribed area, the construction of a facility near the pipeline or a non-agricultural crossing for which consent was not obtained;</li>
<li>a ground disturbance within the prescribed area or the construction of a facility near the pipeline for which a locate request was not obtained;</li>
<li>a ground disturbance within the prescribed area or construction of a facility in a manner that does not meet the conditions outlined in the consent or does not accord with the instructions of an authorized field representative;</li>
<li>a crossing in the absence of consent for the purposes of an agricultural activity in an area that has been identified by the pipeline company as a location where such crossings could impair the pipeline&rsquo;s safety and security.</li>
</ul>
<p>A failure to follow the requirements in the Regulations (e.g. obtaining consent, complying with conditions of consent, performing a locate request) must be immediately reported by the pipeline company to the Board.</p>
<p>If the Regulations are not followed when conducting an activity that causes a ground disturbance in the prescribed area, constructing a facility near a pipeline, or crossing a pipeline, it is unauthorized, and illegal, unless otherwise authorized by the Board.</p>
<p>The NEB may enforce against unauthorized activities for environmental protection and the safety of all involved. Contravention of section&nbsp;112 of the NEB Act or the Regulations is an offence and could be subject to prosecution. Such contraventions are also designated violations subject to a monetary penalty under the NEB&rsquo;s <em>Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations</em> (AMPs). For more information on AMPs, please go to the NEB&rsquo;s website at <a href="">www.neb-one.gc.ca</a>.</p>

<h2 id="s5">5. Safety Checklist</h2>
<p>The safety and security of Canadians and protection of the environment is the NEB&rsquo;s top priority. We recognize that anyone who lives and works near pipelines plays a key role in pipeline safety. You can help create a safe and secure environment for you, your family and community and the environment by following this checklist.</p>
<p>Please note that this checklist is a guide. Refer to the <em>DPR</em> <em>– Authorizations </em>to ensure that your project follows safety and legal requirements.</p>
<ol class="lst-spcd">
<li><strong>Plan your activity.</strong> Identify the precise location of your work, check records for evidence of pipeline easements or other buried facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Go to the site </strong> and look for pipeline warning signs or pipeline marker posts.</li>
<li><strong>Contact the pipeline company</strong> and obtain a copy of the pipeline company’s guidelines for constructing a facility, conducting activities causing a ground disturbance, or crossings in the vicinity of a pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain the pipeline company’s written consent</strong> for the construction of facilities across, on, along or under a pipeline, conducting activities causing a ground disturbance in the prescribed area, or crossing a pipeline with a vehicle or mobile equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Make a locate request</strong> at least three working days before the day on which the construction or ground disturbance activity is started, by calling the one-call centre, or by calling the pipeline company where there is no one-call centre, to have the pipe located and marked.</li>
<li><strong>Be on site</strong> when the pipeline is located, and <strong>know the meaning of the pipeline markings</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Review NEB requirements </strong> with all persons working on your behalf, including employees, contractors and subcontractors, to ensure they are aware of their obligations. Keep documents with safety requirements and guidance on site.</li>
<li><strong>Expose the pipe by hand digging or other acceptable excavation techniques accepted by the pipeline company </strong>prior to any mechanical excavation within three&nbsp;metres of the pipe. <strong>Follow the instructions of the pipeline company&rsquo;s authorized field representative.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Notify the pipeline company </strong>prior to backfilling over the pipe or facilities, where the pipe or facilities have been exposed. <strong>Follow the instructions of the pipeline company&rsquo;s authorized field representative. </strong></li>
<li><strong>IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE PIPELINE COMPANY IF YOU COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE PIPE! </strong>A small scratch or dent in the pipe&rsquo;s coating can impact the long term safety of the pipe and must be assessed by the pipeline company.</li>

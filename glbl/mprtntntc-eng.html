          <h3><a id="s1_1"></a>Your Privacy and the Internet</h3>
          <p>
            The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers automatically
            collect certain information about a visit to a website, including
            the visitor’s Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are
            unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all
            devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log
            the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its
            own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain
            circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example,
            it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this

            The Board is authorized to collect and use personal information in
            the context of an NEB regulatory proceeding to assess applications.
            The Board will collect, use and disclose that information for the
            purpose of the proceeding. For example, when you apply to
            participate in a hearing, you must provide personal contact
            information and this will be made public along with your documents.
            If you are a participant in the proceeding, all documents you file
            will be made public. Your contact information will be used by
            parties in the proceeding to contact you or serve documents on you.
            If you submit sensitive information, you may ask the Board to treat
            the information as confidential. The Board will then decide if the
            interest in keeping the information confidential outweighs the
            interest in disclosure.  Generally, the Board has held that there is
            a public interest in an open and accessible process and that
            confidentiality orders should be the exception.

          <p>
            A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors’ browser in
            order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server
            to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the website.
            Examples of digital markers are “cookies” or HTML5 web storage. Some
            examples of what digital markers do are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              they allow a website to recognize a previous visit each time the
              visitor accesses the site;
            </li>
            <li>
              they track what information is viewed on a site which helps
              website administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking

            The National Energy Board uses
            <em>sessional or persistent</em> digital markers on some portions of
            its website. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data
            with the National Energy Board’s Web server. The digital markers
            used do not allow the National Energy Board to identify individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers,

          <h2><a id="s7"></a>Interacting With Us on Social Media</h2>
          <p>
            This notice has been written to explain how the National Energy
            Board interacts with the public on social media platforms.
          </p>
          <h3><a id="s7_1"></a>National Energy Board - Twitter Guidelines</h3>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_1"></a>Content</h4>
          <p>
            The Communications Team manages the National Energy Board’s Twitter
            accounts with input from various subject matter experts. If you
            follow any of our accounts on Twitter, you can expect, depending on
            the account, between three to fifteen broadcasts a week covering
            some or all of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Updates on major projects and applications</li>
            <li>
              News releases, speeches, and statements published on the web
            </li>
            <li>
              Public Outreach – Information about events, information sessions
              or open houses hosted or attended by the NEB
            </li>
            <li>Photos</li>
            <li>Relevant website updates and publications</li>
            <li>Career opportunities</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_2"></a>Following</h4>
          <p>
            Our following you does not imply endorsement of any kind, and we
            reserve the right to un-follow any individual or organization that
            tweets inappropriate content.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_3"></a>Availability</h4>
          <p>
            The Twitter accounts are normally updated and monitored during
            regular business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time),
            Monday through Friday. Comments submitted after hours or on weekends
            will be read and posted as early as possible. We accept no
            responsibility for lack of service due to Twitter downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            For <strong>media inquiries</strong>, please refrain from submitting
            questions on Twitter, and instead contact NEB Media Relations at
            403-299-7875.
          </p>
          <h4><a id="s7_1_4"></a>@Replies and Direct Messages</h4>
          <p>
            Feedback and ideas are welcome. While we are not able to reply
            individually to all the messages received via Twitter, all @replies
            and direct messages will be read. They will be handled on a
            case-by-case basis and responded to when deemed appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We cannot engage on issues or answer questions that violate the
            principles of our <a href="#s7">Social Media Comment Guidelines</a>.
            Comments in violation of those guidelines may result in blocking the
            user in question to prevent further inappropriate tweets.

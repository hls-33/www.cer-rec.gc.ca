            Trans Mountain Expansion Project
          </p>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or Board) finds that the Trans
            Mountain Expansion Project (Project) is in Canada’s public interest
            and recommends that Governor in Council (GIC) approve the Project,
            subject to 157&nbsp;conditions. Should GIC approve the Project, it
            would direct the Board to issue a new Certificate of Public
            Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) and amended CPCNs. The associated
            regulatory instruments (Instruments) issued by the Board would only
            come into effect if GIC approves the Project.
          </p>
          <h2 class="list-unstyled "><em>The Project</em></h2>
          <p>
            The Project proposes to expand the existing Trans Mountain pipeline
            system between Edmonton, AB and Burnaby, B.C., nearly tripling the
            capacity to ship oil from 300,000&nbsp;barrels per day (bpd) to
            890,000&nbsp;bpd.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the pipeline route for the Project
            parallels existing disturbance, including the right-of-way for Trans
            Mountain’s existing pipeline. This is appropriate, as it reduces the
            requirements for new right-of-way disturbance, minimizes the
            potential impacts of construction, and reduces effects on nearby
            residents and communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Project includes approximately 987&nbsp;km of new pipeline, new
            and modified facilities, such as pump stations and tanks, and the
            reactivation of 193&nbsp;km of existing pipeline. The Westridge
            Marine Terminal (WMT) would also be expanded. Oil would be loaded
            onto tankers at the WMT for Washington State, California and Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full description of the Project is provided in Chapter&nbsp;1 of
            the National Energy Board Report (Report).
          </p>
          <h2 class="list-unstyled "><em>Environmental Assessment</em></h2>
          <p>
            The Board completed a full and comprehensive environmental
            assessment. The Board’s environmental assessment fulfils the
            requirements of both the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB
            Act) and the
            <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em>
            (CEAA&nbsp;2012). The Board is of the view that overall, with the
            implementation of Trans Mountain’s environmental protection
            procedures and mitigation and the Board’s recommended conditions,
            the Project would not likely cause significant adverse environmental
            effects. While the Board recommends there be no findings of
            significant adverse environmental effects pursuant to the
            CEAA&nbsp;2012, the Board found significant effects related to
            increases in marine shipping assessed under the NEB Act. These are
            described in Chapter&nbsp;14 of the Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            While marine shipping is not part of the Project, and is not
            regulated by the NEB, the Board, as part of its overall public
            interest determination, considered the potential environmental
            effects and socio-economic effects of increased marine shipping
            activities. This included the potential effects of accidents or
            malfunctions.
          </p>
          <h2 class="list-unstyled "><em>Benefits of the Project</em></h2>
          <p>
            In considering whether the Project is in the public interest, the
            Board concluded there would be a number of important benefits for
            Canada. These benefits would be considerable and include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>increased access to diverse markets for Canadian oil;</li>

          <h2 class="list-unstyled "><em>Indigenous Interests</em></h2>
          <p>
            The Board considered the concerns expressed by Indigenous groups,
            how the Project and related tanker traffic could impact Indigenous
            interests, and the appropriate means of mitigating such impacts. The
            Board’s process is designed to be thorough and accessible to
            Indigenous groups so that they may make their concerns known to the
            Board and have those concerns considered and addressed.

            Should the Project proceed, Trans Mountain would be required to
            continue its consultation with potentially affected Indigenous
            groups throughout the life of the Project. As part of the Board’s
            conditions, Trans Mountain would report to the Board on its
            consultation with Indigenous groups during construction and through
            the first five years of operations. Consultation would include the
            development of a number of plans related to, among other things,
            environmental protection and emergency response programs.

          <h2 class="list-unstyled "><em>Commitments and conditions</em></h2>
          <p>
            Trans Mountain has formally committed to specific mitigation
            measures and should GIC approve the Project, the Board would attach
            157 conditions to the CPCNs and Instruments that cover a wide range
            of matters, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>emergency preparedness and response</li>

            <em>Residual Burdens of Project-related marine shipping</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Even with Trans Mountain’s commitments and the Board’s conditions,
            some impacts or residual burdens would remain, and were fully
            considered and weighed by the Board in coming to its recommendation.
            The full description of how the Board balanced the benefits and
            burdens can be found in Chapter&nbsp;2 of the Report.
          </p>
          <p>
            In regard to residual burdens from Project-related marine vessels,
            the Board kept in mind that Project-related vessels would follow a
            route that currently has high levels of vessel traffic, and that,
            even if the Project does not proceed, the level of traffic is
            predicted to increase in the future. While the effects from
            Project-related marine vessels would be a small fraction of the
            total cumulative effects, the Board found that the operation of
            Project-related marine vessels would further contribute to
            cumulative effects that are already jeopardizing the recovery of the
            Southern resident killer whale. Therefore, the Board finds that the
            operation of Project-related marine vessels would likely result in
            significant adverse effects to the Southern resident killer whale,
            and on Indigenous cultural use associated with the Southern resident
            killer whale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the current and predicted future vessel traffic, even
            if the Project does not proceed, would contribute to an increase in
            Canadian greenhouse gas emissions. While the Board recognizes that
            emissions from Project-related marine vessels would be a small
            percentage relative to Canadian greenhouse gas emissions, given that
            there are no regulatory reporting thresholds or specific
            requirements for marine greenhouse gas emissions in Canada, the
            Board finds the greenhouse gas emissions from Project-related marine
            vessels would likely be significant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also took into consideration the likelihood and potential
            consequence of a large spill from the Project or from a
            Project-related tanker. The Board finds that both of these events
            would be of very low probability given all of the mitigation and
            safety measures being implemented, but nonetheless, would have a
            significant effect in the event of a large spill. This factored into
            the Board’s assessment of burdens.
          </p>
          <h2 class="list-unstyled ">
            <em
              >Balancing the benefits and residual burdens to reach its public
              interest recommendation</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Board weighed the totality of the benefits and residual burdens
            to come to its public interest recommendation under the NEB Act. In
            making its recommendation, the Board focussed on the overall
            Canadian public interest. On the whole, taking into account all of
            the evidence in the hearing, considering all relevant factors, and
            given that there are considerable benefits nationally, regionally
            and to some degree locally, the Board found that the benefits of the
            Project would outweigh the residual burdens. Accordingly, the Board
            concludes that the Project is in the Canadian public interest.
          </p>
          <h2 class="list-unstyled "><em>Lifecycle Regulation</em></h2>
          <p>
            Should the GIC approve the Project, it is important to keep in mind
            that approval of the Project, through the issuance of the CPCNs and
            Instruments, is just one phase in the Board’s lifecycle regulation.
            Throughout the lifecycle of the Project, the NEB would hold Trans
            Mountain accountable for meeting its regulatory requirements in
            order to keep its pipelines and facilities safe and secure, and
            protect people, property and the environment.
          </p>
          <h2 class="list-unstyled "><em>What’s next?</em></h2>
          <p>
            As required by the NEB Act, the Board has submitted its
            recommendation to the Minister of Natural Resources Canada. The
            Government of Canada announced in January 2016 an interim approach
            for reviewing major natural resource projects.
          </p>

                        The Governor in Council should develop an Offset Program
                        to offset both the increased underwater noise and the
                        increased strike risk posed to Species at Risk Act
                        -listed marine mammal and fish species (including
                        Southern resident killer whale) due to Project-related
                        marine shipping, at each relevant section of the marine
                        shipping route (i.e., Strait of Georgia, Boundary Pass,
                        Haro Strait, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and out to the
                        12-nautical-mile territorial sea limit), and at the
                        relevant times of year. Each offset measure should apply
                        to all appropriate vessels for that measure (i.e., not
                        limited to Project-related vessels), to be determined on
                        a case-by-case basis according to the type of measure

                        governments, VFPA, and other relevant stakeholders. The

                        data collection that is necessary to successfully

                        information on the number of vessel strikes on marine
                        mammals can be gathered. There should be periodic public
                        reporting that provides, at the appropriate times, the
                        information necessary to demonstrate a robust Offset
                        Program. This should include measured or estimated
                        underwater noise and strike risk due to Project-related
                        marine shipping, and the extent over time to which that
                        additional noise and strike risk has been offset in each
                        section of the route, including the monitoring/modelling
                        used to demonstrate that.

                        The Governor in Council should actively support the
                        development and implementation of greenhouse gas
                        reduction measures related to marine shipping that would

                        Strategy by year 2023 for reducing greenhouse gas
                        emissions. These measures could include, but not be
                        limited to:

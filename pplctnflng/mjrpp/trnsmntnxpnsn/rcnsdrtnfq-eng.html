            General Questions on the Reconsideration of Trans Mountain Expansion
            Project
          </h2>
          <p id="s1_1"><strong>1. What has the NEB announced?</strong></p>
          <p>
            On September&nbsp;26, 2018, the National Energy Board (NEB)
            announced that it will hold a public hearing to carry out its
            reconsideration related to the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, as
            ordered by the Government of Canada
            <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/Filing/A94111"
              >[Filing&nbsp;A94111]</a
            >. The NEB assigned a panel, opened up the
            application-to-participate process, and sought public comment on the
            focus and design of the upcoming hearing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the close of the application-to-participate process, the
            NEB identified the persons and groups that were granted intervenor
            status on October&nbsp;5, 2018.
            <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/Filing/A94624"
              >[Filing&nbsp;A94624]</a
            >
            Reasons for the participation decision were issued on
            October&nbsp;11, 2018.
            <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/Filing/A94753"
              >[Filing&nbsp;A94753]</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB considered the comments received and, on October&nbsp;12,
            2018, released a hearing order setting out next steps and schedule
            for the reconsideration as well as requests for information from
            Trans Mountain and Federal Authorities.
          </p>
          <p id="s1_2">
            <strong>2. Can the NEB meet the timeline set by Government?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB will carry out its reconsideration related to the Trans
            Mountain Expansion Project as directed by the Order in Council in a
            fair, efficient, and transparent manner. The NEB is confident in its
            ability to complete a thorough review of the specific matters as it
            was directed by the Government within the required 155 days set by
            the Order in Council
            <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/Filing/A94111"
              >[Filing&nbsp;A94111]</a
            >.

          <p id="s1_3">
            <strong
              >3. Does the NEB have the appropriate people do this work?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB has experienced, expert technical staff, including
            Environmental, Emergency Management and Socio-economic specialists
            who support the NEB’s environmental assessments. The reconsideration
            hearing will be a comprehensive scientific and technical examination
            of project-related marine shipping.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB has been considering environmental matters in its decisions
            since the early 1970s, and has been conducting EAs under the CEA Act
            since it first came into force in 1995, including joint review panel
            assessments, substituted and delegated review panel assessments,
            comprehensive study assessments, and screening-level assessments.

          <p id="s1_4">
            <strong

              initial assessment?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB did consider the potential environmental and socio-economic
            effects of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project-related tanker
            traffic, including the potential effects of accidents or
            malfunctions that may occur, in coming to its public interest
            determination under the National Energy Board Act. Chapter 14 of the
            Board’s report (pages 323 – 405) addresses impacts related to marine
            shipping activities. The Federal Court of Appeal found that the NEB
            ought to reconsider its decision not to include project-related
            marine shipping as part of the designated project assessed under the
            Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA).

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the hearing process, the NEB solicited comments
            on certain matters, including the focus and design of the hearing
            process. While those comment periods have expired, there is still an
            opportunity to participate. Those people/groups who were granted
            intervenor status will be able to submit relevant evidence, question
            other’s evidence and provide argument. Those that applied and were
            not granted intervenor status, and any other member of the public,
            can submit a letter of comment for the NEB’s consideration by
            November&nbsp;20, 2018.

            The NEB announced on September&nbsp;26, 2018 that it will hold a
            public hearing to reconsider aspects of its Recommendation Report
            dealing with project-related marine shipping. On October&nbsp;12,
            2018, the NEB issued a Hearing Order setting out the steps and
            deadlines for the public hearing, which includes hearing oral
            traditional evidence from Indigenous intervenors. This hearing
            process is part of the overall consultation process. Indigenous
            communities, peoples and organizations that were consulted in the
            original hearing received notice and at least 42&nbsp;Indigenous
            groups became intervenors by applying or registering to participate.

          <p id="s2_1"><strong>1. What does the Hearing Order mean?</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Hearing Order outlines the steps and deadlines that will be
            followed during the public reconsideration hearing. It also
            describes the various roles and responsibilities of the hearing
            participants. The NEB took into account the comments it received in
            deciding on this hearing process.
          </p>
          <p id="s2_2"><strong>2. What are the next steps?</strong></p>
          <p>
            November&nbsp;20 is the next big filing deadline, where all
            intervenors (other than Federal Departments and Agencies who filed
            their material on Oct.&nbsp;31) must file their opening statement
            and direct evidence. Any member of the public may file a letter of
            comment by November&nbsp;20 as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oral traditional evidence sessions will be held at three locations
            (Calgary, Victoria, Nanaimo) between November&nbsp;19 and
            December&nbsp;6, 2018.

            The deadlines for this hearing reflect the focused and expedited

          </p>
          <p>
            On September&nbsp;26, 2018, the NEB sought comments on whether
            project-related marine shipping should be included in the
            “designated project”. In response to the comments received, the NEB
            sought further comments on the limited issue of whether the
            “designated project” should extend to Canada’s territorial sea limit
            (12 nautical miles) or to Canada’s exclusive economic zone
            (200&nbsp;nautical miles).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board decided, on a principled basis, to include Project-related
            marine shipping between the Westridge Marine Terminal and the
            12-nautical-mile territorial sea limit in the “designated project”
            to be assessed under the CEAA. Reasons for this decision will be
            coming shortly.

          <p>
            At least 42&nbsp;Indigenous groups applied or registered to
            participate in the hearing and have become intervenors. Any
            Indigenous groups that are not intervenors and wish to file a letter

          <p>
            The NEB understands that Indigenous peoples have an oral tradition
            for sharing knowledge and this information cannot always be shared
            adequately or appropriately in writing. The NEB extended an
            invitation to all Indigenous intervenors to provide oral traditional
            evidence in this reconsideration hearing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oral traditional evidence sessions will be held at three locations
            (Calgary, Victoria, Nanaimo) between November&nbsp;19 and
            December&nbsp;6, 2018. Indigenous intervenors are encouraged to also
            make use of their opportunity to file written evidence, to the
            extent adequate and appropriate, so as much time as possible can be
            spent listening to evidence that can only be provided orally.

          <p>
            In addition to the NEB’s reconsideration process, Natural Resources
            Canada will be conducting Phase&nbsp;III consultation with
            potentially impacted Indigenous groups. Details on this process will
            be provided directly by the Federal Government.

            broadcast live via the Board’s website.

            To date, the NEB has made decisions on 148&nbsp;applications for

          <p>
            Oral Traditional Evidence (OTE) can be given by Indigenous
            intervenors in the Reconsideration hearing process who have
            registered to provide it. The NEB has set aside three weeks to hear
            OTE. In setting the schedule, the Board took into account comments
            and preferences received from participating intervenors. The NEB
            understands that Indigenous peoples have an oral tradition for
            sharing knowledge from generation to generation, and OTE is offered
            in recognition that this information cannot always be shared
            adequately or appropriately in writing.

          <p>
            The NEB has scheduled three weeks to hear OTE from participating
            Indigenous intervenors. Some flexibility exists in the schedule if
            changes need to be made. Should intervenors feel that more time is
            required to share their OTE, they may provide the Board with an
            audio or video recording.

            specifically the List of Issues for this hearing. OTE that was
            provided in the original Certificate hearing is on the record of

            evidence, members of their communities, registered intervenors,
            Trans Mountain, and accredited media. Members of the public can

          <p>
            Only Indigenous peoples participating as intervenors are permitted
            to give oral evidence. The NEB understands that Indigenous peoples
            have an oral tradition for sharing knowledge from generation to
            generation, and OTE is offered in recognition that this information
            cannot always be shared adequately or appropriately in writing. All
            hearing intervenors are allowed and encouraged to file written
            evidence, and any other member of the public can file a letter of
            comment by Nov.&nbsp;20.

                This introduction contains the National Energy Board&rsquo;s
                (Board or NEB) overall conclusions and recommendations with
                respect to the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (Project). It
                also sets the context for how the Board approached the
                Reconsideration it was directed to undertake by the Governor in
                Council (GIC), and contains remarks on some of the multifaceted
                considerations that informed the Board&rsquo;s conclusions. This
                includes details regarding the holistic, systemic and
                precautionary approach that the Board took to examining and
                addressing effects likely to be caused by the Project on the
                Salish Sea and its complex and interconnected ecosystem. This
                introduction should be read together with &ndash; and not in
                isolation from &ndash; the detailed reasons that follow in the
                subsequent chapters of this report.
              </p>
              <h2>Disposition</h2>
              <p>
                After completing the Reconsideration hearing and having regard
                to all relevant considerations, the Board is of the view that
                the Project is and will be required by the present and future
                public convenience and necessity, and is in the Canadian public
                interest. Pursuant to the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act),
                the Board confirms the recommendation, and replaces certain
                conditions, that it provided to the GIC in its OH-001-2014
                Report. The Board recommends that the GIC approve the Project by
                directing the issuance of a certificate of public convenience
                and necessity (CPCN) to Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC (Trans
                Mountain), subject to 156 conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012
                (CEAA 2012) the Board is of the view that the designated Project
                is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects.
                Specifically, Project-related marine shipping is likely to cause
                significant adverse environmental effects on the Southern
                resident killer whale, and on Indigenous cultural use associated
                with the Southern resident killer whale. This is despite the
                fact that effects from Project-related marine shipping will be a
                small fraction of the total cumulative effects, and the level of
                marine traffic is expected to increase regardless of whether the
                Project is approved. The Board also finds that greenhouse gas
                emissions from Project-related marine vessels would result in
                measureable increases and, taking a precautionary approach, are
                likely to be significant. While a credible worst-case spill from
                the Project or a Project-related vessel is not likely, if it
                were to occur, the environmental effects would be significant.
                While these effects weighed heavily in the Board&rsquo;s
                reconsideration of Project-related marine shipping, the Board
                recommends that, in light of the considerable benefits of the
                Project and measures to mitigate the effects, the GIC find that
                they can be justified in the circumstances. The Board has
                identified a recommended follow-up program to be implemented
                with respect to the designated Project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pursuant to the Species at Risk Act (SARA), the Board has
                identified the adverse effects of the Project and its related
                marine shipping on each SARA-listed wildlife species and its
                critical habitat, and has imposed (through conditions) and
                recommended (to the GIC) measures to avoid or lessen those
                effects and to monitor them.
              </p>
              <h2>Reconsideration background and process</h2>
              <p>
                If approved, the Project would expand the existing Trans
                Mountain Pipeline system between Edmonton, Alberta and Burnaby,
                British Columbia (B.C.), nearly tripling its capacity to ship
                oil from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day. Almost 90 per cent
                of the Project route parallels existing disturbance, including
                the right-of-way for the existing pipeline. The Project includes
                approximately 987 kilometres of new pipeline, new and modified
                facilities such as pump stations and tanks, and the reactivation
                of 193 kilometres of existing pipeline. The Westridge Marine
                Terminal (WMT) would also be expanded. Oil would be loaded onto
                tankers at the WMT for transit to Washington State, California,
                and Asia.
              </p>
              <p>
                In May 2016, after an approximately two-year regulatory review
                (the OH-001-2014 hearing), the Board issued its OH-001-2014
                Report recommending that the GIC approve the Project.
                Project-related marine shipping was considered as part of that
                review and report, but only under the NEB Act &ndash; not under
                the CEAA 2012. On 29 November 2016, the GIC approved the
                Project, issuing Order in Council (OIC) P.C. 2016-1069.
                Accordingly, on 1 December 2016, the Board issued CPCN OC-064 to
                Trans Mountain, along with amendments to other existing CPCNs.
                Additional related instruments in respect of the Project also
                came into effect at that time. These regulatory instruments
                authorized the construction and operation of the Project,
                subject to 157 conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 30 August 2018, the Federal Court of Appeal in Tsleil-Waututh
                Nation v. Canada (Attorney General) set aside OIC P.C.
                2016-1069, in part because, in the Court&rsquo;s view, the Board
                unjustifiably excluded Project-related marine shipping from the
                scope of the &ldquo;designated project&rdquo; reviewed under the
                CEAA 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 20 September 2018, the GIC issued OIC P.C. 2018-1177,
                directing the Board to conduct a Reconsideration taking into
                account the environmental effects of Project-related marine
                shipping in view of the requirements of the CEAA 2012, and the
                adverse effects of Project-related marine shipping on species at
                risk in view of any requirements of section 79 of the SARA. The
                OIC instructed the Board to complete the Reconsideration within
                155 days.
              </p>
              <p>
                In carrying out the Reconsideration, the Board held a public
                hearing (the MH-052-2018 hearing) and has prepared this
                MH-052-2018 Report as a result. As directed by the OIC and as
                reflected in the Board&rsquo;s List of Issues (see Appendix 1),
                this Reconsideration is focused on Project-related marine
                shipping &ndash; a comparatively narrow scope to the OH-001-2014
                hearing. The Board&rsquo;s focus was on any necessary changes or
                additions to its OH-001-2014 Report in light of the inclusion of
                Project-related marine shipping in the designated Project being
                assessed under the CEAA 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of this introduction and disposition, there is a
                roadmap to this MH-052-2018 Report, which explains how it is
                laid out to incorporate both new information received through
                the MH-052-2018 hearing, and information received during the
                OH-001-2014 hearing. The Board has structured this MH-052-2018
                Report in this manner to ensure that all pertinent information
                about the Project and its related marine shipping is captured in
                a single, consolidated report to the GIC.
              </p>
              <h2>Considering the evidence and submissions</h2>
              <p>
                While the Reconsideration was a focused hearing, the evidentiary
                record was nevertheless substantial, and included additional
                investigative and scientific studies that have been completed
                since the close of the OH-001-2014 hearing record. The level of
                participation was also substantial, with a total of 118
                intervenors that included 52 Indigenous intervenors, and 8
                federal government department intervenors. Any member of the
                public was able to file a letter of comment, and many took the
                opportunity to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to issuing a Hearing Order, the Board sought public
                comments on the scope of the environmental assessment and List
                of Issues, and the design of the hearing process. Intervenors
                provided evidence and argument, and were given an opportunity to
                question the evidence of other intervenors and Trans Mountain. A
                total of $4,981,760 in participant funding was offered to 69
                recipients, 82 per cent of which was offered to Indigenous
                intervenors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Much of the evidence and submissions presented was relevant,
                informative, and helpful to the Board. The Board appreciates the
                efforts and diligence of the Parties in preparing their evidence
                and submissions, including the Indigenous oral traditional
                evidence that the Board heard over approximately three weeks in
                Calgary, Alberta, and in Victoria and Nanaimo, B.C.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the Board observes that, regrettably, not all Parties
                and commenters adhered to the Hearing Order and many filed
                evidence or offered comments on issues canvassed in the
                OH-001-2014 hearing or that were not within the scope of this
                Reconsideration, adding unnecessarily to the complexity of the
                hearing process. The Board did not consider evidence or revisit
                issues that were outside of the scope of the Reconsideration.
              </p>
              <p>
                In making their submissions, some Parties implored the Board to
                not only listen, but to hear what they were saying. Elder George
                Harris from Stz&rsquo;uminus First Nation said it this way:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  You know, in our culture and traditional ways of our people,
                  when we go into our longhouse, my speaker, when he says,
                  &ldquo;Listen, listen,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a big part of our
                  culture. We listen. I&rsquo;m hoping that you, the Panel, are
                  going to listen. I&rsquo;m hoping our words are heard beyond
                  this room.
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The Board has endeavored to do this &ndash; to listen, hear, and
                share the evidence and views of the Parties with the GIC
                and&nbsp;Canadians.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has carefully considered all of the relevant evidence
                and submissions it received. The Board is of the view that the
                MH-052-2018 hearing offered a fair and meaningful opportunity
                for Parties to participate and to fully present their case and
                represent their diverse points of view.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board&rsquo;s MH-052-2018 hearing also forms part of the
                overall consultation process with Indigenous peoples with
                respect to their constitutionally protected rights. In this
                regard, the GIC has indicated that it will rely on the
                NEB&rsquo;s process, to the extent possible, to discharge the
                duty to consult. The Board&rsquo;s MH-052-2018 Report may also
                inform the additional &ldquo;Phase&nbsp;III&rdquo; consultations
                being carried out separately by the Government of Canada with
                respect to the Project. Although the GIC has the responsibility
                of ultimately ensuring that the duty to consult has been
                fulfilled before a decision is made on the Project, the Board
                has considered those aspects of consultation which are relevant
                to the Reconsideration and for which evidence was filed on the
                record.
              </p>
              <h2>Weighing the public interest</h2>
              <p>
                The Board has undertaken this Reconsideration in accordance with
                the requirements of the NEB Act, the CEAA 2012, and the SARA,
                and with the Canadian public interest as a guide.
              </p>
              <p>
                Weighing the public interest, as required by the NEB Act, is not
                a rigid or mechanical task. It is a complex, flexible, and
                multifaceted inquiry that requires the Board to conduct a
                thorough and scientific examination of evidence relating to
                economic, environmental, and social factors; to consider the
                impacts of the Project on Indigenous rights; to weigh and
                balance the overall benefits and burdens of the Project; and to
                draw conclusions. This consideration of benefits and burdens
                also informs the Board&rsquo;s recommendation under the CEAA
                2012 regarding whether any significant adverse environmental
                effects can be justified in the circumstances. The various
                factors that the Board considers in this inquiry cannot be
                understood in isolation from one another, or divorced from the
                specific context and circumstances surrounding this Project.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Board&rsquo;s view, the benefits of the Project are
                considerable, including increased access to diverse markets for
                Canadian oil; jobs created across Canada; the development of
                capacity of local and Indigenous individuals, communities, and
                businesses; direct spending on pipeline materials in Canada; and
                considerable revenues to various levels of government.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the Board is also of the view that the Project and its
                related marine shipping carries risks. Its burdens include the
                significant adverse effects that are likely to be caused by
                Project-related marine shipping on the Southern resident killer
                whale and Indigenous cultural use associated with the Southern
                resident killer whale.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, the benefits and burdens of the Project and its related
                marine shipping are not distributed evenly across
                the&nbsp;country.
              </p>
              <p>
                In light of these circumstances, reasonable people can and will
                disagree on what the best balance and outcome is for Canadians.
                Sometimes, Parties disagree on the evidence and facts, while
                other times, Parties agree on the facts but differ in their
                opinions, perspectives, or values. In carrying out the
                Reconsideration, the Board has listened carefully and taken into
                account diverse views. The Board has remained cognizant that the
                public interest is not regionally based, but is inclusive of all
                Canadians. It must also be responsive to Canadians&rsquo;
                interests and values as they change over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is through this holistic and contextual lens that the Board
                has carried out its environmental assessment, including the
                justification analysis; considered and weighed the
                Project&rsquo;s benefits and burdens; and determined that the
                Project is in the Canadian public interest.
              </p>
              <h2>Taking a precautionary approach</h2>
              <p>
                Many Parties in the MH-052-2018 hearing emphasized the
                application of the precautionary principle, despite the fact
                that there were different interpretations expressed as to
                exactly what the principle requires.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board recognizes the important role of the precautionary
                principle under the CEAA 2012. The precautionary principle
                requires that environmental measures must anticipate and prevent
                environmental harm. A lack of full scientific certainty should
                not be used as a reason for not implementing measures to prevent
                environmental harm. Adaptive management can, in certain
                circumstances, be an important part of a follow-up program for a
                project to allow for uncertainties in the environmental
                assessment process. The Board is of the view that certain
                activities may be permitted despite a lack of full scientific
                certainty regarding their effects, provided the activity and its
                effects can be effectively monitored and adaptively managed.
                This involves an exercise in balancing interests and weighing
                risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has applied the precautionary principle to its
                environmental assessment in this case. As examples, the Board
                has applied the precautionary principle to its significance
                determinations, and to its consideration of measures to mitigate
                impacts through design, planning, follow-up, and monitoring. The
                Board has required that effects or consequences be minimized,
                even if they are only anticipated or possible and not certain.
              </p>
              <p>
                The importance of taking a precautionary approach is evident
                when faced with the Salish Sea and its complex and not
                necessarily well-understood ecosystem. An approximately
                18,000-square-kilometre body of water that includes the Straits
                of Juan de Fuca and Georgia as well as Puget Sound, the Salish
                Sea is home to diverse marine life. This includes a number of
                endangered and threatened species, some of which are of
                particular importance to Indigenous peoples and intrinsic to
                Indigenous cultural and spiritual practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over 6.5 million people live on or in close proximity to the
                Salish Sea, and it is home to a population of over 35 types of
                mammals, 170 species of bird, 240 kinds of fish, and 3,000
                species of invertebrates. Not surprisingly, the health of the
                Salish Sea is of significant importance to all who live in the
                area.
              </p>
              <p>
                The evidence in the MH-052-2018 hearing is clear that the Salish
                Sea is not the healthy environment it once was. It is subject to
                a number of stressors, including vessel traffic and resulting
                noise, environmental contaminants, and a decline in salmon. The
                causes for the current state of the Salish Sea are numerous and
                diverse, and these effects have accumulated over time. There
                appears to be no serious controversy among the Parties with
                regard to these points, nor does there appear to be any serious
                controversy that Project-related marine shipping is likely to
                cause significant adverse environmental effects. This is despite
                the fact that Project-related marine shipping would comprise a
                relatively small increase in the total vessel traffic in the
                Salish Sea, and that increased pressure on the Salish Sea and
                its marine life can be anticipated regardless of whether the
                Project proceeds.
              </p>
              <h2>Taking an holistic approach</h2>
              <p>
                Given the cultural, environmental, and commercial importance of
                the Salish Sea, the Board has adopted an holistic approach to
                its consideration of the designated Project and how it fits into
                the wider context of the many current stressors on that body of
                water, the marine animals and fishes within it, and the people
                who derive cultural use, livelihood, or pleasure from it. The
                Board concludes that, while Project-related marine
                shipping&rsquo;s incremental addition to cumulative effects on
                the Salish Sea will not be large, it will add to already
                significant effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Addressing effects, and cumulative effects in particular, on the
                Salish Sea requires a broad, systemic, and multi-faceted
                approach. To understand the effects of Project-related marine
                shipping and how best to mitigate those effects, one needs to
                understand the complex and interconnected system that it would
                operate within. In order to be most effective in mitigating
                environmental harm to the Salish Sea and its ecosystem that is
                likely to be caused by the Project, a broader approach is
                required; one which extends beyond the NEB&rsquo;s regulatory
                authorities and one which will benefit the broader system. The
                Board has conducted its environmental assessment, set Project
                conditions, and made its broader recommendations to the GIC with
                this in mind. This includes making recommendations that use an
                offset-based approach. It is the Board&rsquo;s view that, should
                the GIC make changes to the operation of all marine traffic,
                including Project-related traffic, and take action to relieve
                other stressors within the broader system, it will offset the
                incremental effects of the designated Project and make material
                improvements to the health of the Salish Sea.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board is also supportive of the role of the Indigenous
                Advisory and Monitoring Committee (IAMC) for the Project. In the
                Board&rsquo;s view, the IAMC is well placed to help facilitate
                effective and ongoing Indigenous consultation and participation
                in Project-related Salish Sea monitoring and follow-up measures.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the Board recognizes that scientific work to better
                understand the Salish Sea is continuing, it has heard a great
                deal of evidence, including from a variety of experts. The Board
                is satisfied that the evidence before it is sufficient for it to
                make the conclusions and recommendations it has reached in this
                MH-052-2018 Report.
              </p>
              <h2>Project conditions and recommendations to the GIC</h2>
              <p>
                The Board will impose 156 conditions on the Project if it is
                approved. It has also made 16 recommendations to the GIC. The
                conditions and recommendations are made in a manner consistent
                with the NEB Act, the CEAA 2012, the SARA, and they apply the
                precautionary principle.
              </p>
              <p>
                The conditions cover a wide range of matters, including
                emergency preparedness and response, protection of the
                environment, consultation with affected Indigenous communities,
                socio-economic matters, pipeline safety and integrity,
                commercial support for the Project prior to construction, and
                financial responsibility on the part of Trans Mountain.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board&rsquo;s recommendations to the GIC relate to
                Project-related marine shipping, including cumulative effects
                management for the Salish Sea, measures to offset increased
                underwater noise and increased strike risk posed to SARA-listed
                marine mammal and fish species, marine oil spill response,
                marine shipping and small vessel safety, reduction of greenhouse
                gas emissions from marine vessels, and the IAMC.
              </p>
              <p>
                In making its recommendations to the GIC, the Board drew
                guidance from the Federal Court of Appeal&rsquo;s decision in
                Tsleil-Waututh Nation. The Court indicated that the Board should
                identify mitigation measures within the authority of the federal
                government, despite the fact that the Board does not regulate
                marine shipping. The Board is also not limited to identifying
                measures that are within Trans Mountain&rsquo;s control to
                implement. With the addition of recommendations about matters
                beyond the Board&rsquo;s authority but within that of the GIC,
                the GIC will possess the requisite breadth of information to
                make the informed decisions required of it with respect to the
                Project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both the conditions and recommendations made by the Board are
                intended to mitigate, avoid, or lessen potential effects
                associated with the Project and its related marine shipping. The
                conditions are regulatory requirements imposed on Trans
                Mountain, which the Board would oversee and enforce as part of
                its regulatory mandate. In comparison, the recommendations to
                the GIC fall outside of the Board&rsquo;s regulatory mandate and
                are generally beyond the control of Trans Mountain. While the
                recommendations are sufficiently specific and are
                evidence-based, they are comparatively less prescriptive than
                the conditions. This provides a measure of flexibility for the
                GIC to determine the details of how best to implement them, and
                the resources required, should it decide to do so. This is
                appropriate given that the optimization of these mitigation
                measures may need to be based on a multitude of factors,
                including the GIC&rsquo;s overall approach for managing
                cumulative effects in the Salish Sea, multi- and
                cross-jurisdictional considerations, and the need to employ
                ongoing adaptive management in light of the complexities and
                uncertainties of the Salish Sea.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Board&rsquo;s recommendations to the GIC are
                directly related to its environmental assessment of
                Project-related marine shipping, the Board is of the view that,
                if implemented, they may assist in mitigating effects of all
                marine traffic in the area. This would be a positive outcome
                that would extend beyond mitigating or offsetting the impacts of
                the Project and its related marine shipping. The Board
                encourages the Government of Canada in the direction it has
                already taken to both deepen the scientific understanding of the
                Salish Sea and its resident marine life, and to continue to put
                in place procedures, programs, equipment, and funding to
                safeguard this important Canadian marine resource.

              <h2>Roadmap to the MH-052-2018 Report</h2>
              <p>
                Given that the Reconsideration focused on Project-related marine
                shipping, much of the OH-001-2014 Report is outside the scope of
                the MH-052-2018 hearing. However, the GIC must be informed about
                all aspects of the Project to make the decisions required of it.
                It is also important to be clear about what changed from the
                OH-001-2014 Report as a result of the MH-052-2018 hearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this reason, this MH-052-2018 Report contains the sections
                that were reconsidered by the Board, as well as sections from
                the OH-001-2014 Report that were beyond the scope of the
                Reconsideration. This ensures that all pertinent information is
                captured in a single consolidated report to the GIC.
              </p>
              <p>
                This MH-052-2018 Report contains the same chapter numbers and
                titles of the OH-001-2014 Report. Although sections of the
                OH-001-2014 Report are included in this MH-052-2018 Report, this
                does not mean that they were within the scope of the
                Reconsideration or reconsidered by the Board. The beginning of
                each chapter contains an explanation of what, if anything, was
                changed from the OH-001-2014 Report.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most chapters in this MH-052-2018 Report were reproduced from
                the OH-001-2014 Report and include the views of the original
                Panel that undertook the OH-001-2014 hearing. These views remain
                valid and unchanged, and are labelled as &ldquo;<strong
                  >Views of the Board</strong
                >.&rdquo; Some chapters have undergone substantive changes as a
                result of the MH-052-2018 hearing and include the views of the
                Panel that carried out the Reconsideration. These are labelled
                as &ldquo;<strong
                  >Views of the Reconsideration&nbsp;Panel</strong
                >.&rdquo;
              </p>
              <p>
                For issues that fall within the scope of the MH-052-2018
                hearing, the Reconsideration Panel included views of the Parties
                from the OH-001-2014 hearing where they were still applicable.
                These are then followed by new or updated evidence raised by the
                Parties in the MH-052-2018 hearing. The views of the
                Reconsideration Panel contain Board views from the OH-001-2014
                Report that were found to remain applicable after considering
                relevant evidence from both the OH-001-2014 and MH-052-2018
                hearings. The views of the Reconsideration Panel include
                additional views to address the new or updated evidence and to
                explain if it confirms or modifies the Board&rsquo;s previous
                findings from the OH-001-2014 hearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of the issues relevant to the MH-052-2018 hearing
                are covered in Chapters 5 and 14. An overview of what was
                considered by the Reconsideration Panel and changed from the
                OH-001-2014 Report is outlined below. The appendices from the
                OH-001-2014 Report have been reproduced, with updates to reflect
                the circumstances and factual underpinnings of the
                Reconsideration. Appendices 14 and 15 are new to this
                MH-052-2018 Report.

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                The Reconsideration has comprised a comprehensive,
                evidence-based, fair, and meaningful review of Project-related
                marine shipping. The Reconsideration process and this resulting
                report discharge the relevant requirements of the Board under
                the NEB Act, the CEAA 2012, and the SARA. The Board finds, in
                conclusion, that the Trans Mountain Expansion Project is in the
                Canadian public interest and recommends to the GIC that it be
                approved.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board thanks the Parties in the MH-052-2018 hearing for
                their thoughtful and thorough participation, which has resulted
                in better information, well-informed conclusions, and more
                effective conditions and recommendations that serve
                all&nbsp;Canadians.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should the Project be approved, the NEB will regulate it
                throughout its full lifecycle. The NEB will oversee Project
                construction and operation, and will hold Trans Mountain
                accountable for meeting its commitments and applicable
                regulatory requirements, keeping its pipelines and facilities
                safe and secure, and protecting people, property, and
                the&nbsp;environment.

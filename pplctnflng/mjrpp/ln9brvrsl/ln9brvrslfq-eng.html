                On 29&nbsp;November&nbsp;2012, Enbridge filed its application
                under section 58 and under Part&nbsp;IV of the
                <em>National Energy Board Act</em>. Enbridge is seeking approval
                for the reversal a 639&nbsp;km segment of Line&nbsp;9 between
                North Westover, Ontario and Montreal, Québec. In addition,
                Enbridge requested to increase the capacity of the entire
                Line&nbsp;9 from approximately 240,000&nbsp;barrels per day
                (bpd)) to approximately 300,000. Also included in the
                application is a request for the revision to the Line&nbsp;9

                If approved, the shift in flow direction from west to east would
                see the pipeline revert back to the direction that was
                originally approved in&nbsp;1975. The current westward flow has
                been in place since&nbsp;1999.

                Applications like this project, filed under section&nbsp;58 or

                After the application was submitted, the NEB reviewed it and
                determined that it was in the interest of Canadians to hold a
                public hearing for the project, consisting of written evidence
                and oral final argument.

                During a review of an application, the NEB considers all
                information that is relevant to the question of whether or not
                the application should be approved. Some of the topics that
                could be considered include:

                In July&nbsp;2012, Parliament passed the
                <em>Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act</em>, which
                changed the criteria for participating in a Board hearing. To
                participate in a hearing, you must either be directly affected
                or have relevant information or expertise. The Board is required
                to hear from persons who are directly affected, and may hear
                from persons who have relevant information or expertise. Anyone
                wishing to participate in a facilities hearing must apply for
                and be granted status to participate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of public hearings is to allow those with an interest
                in a project to participate in the process and express their
                views. Under the amended legislation, the NEB will decide on a
                case-by-case basis who is considered to be directly affected or
                who has relevant information or expertise based on their
                specific and detailed interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your application to participate must clearly demonstrate a
                connection between your interests and the List of Issues to be
                discussed during the hearing. You must fully complete all
                required fields on the Application to Participate Form in order
                to be considered. The Board will only use the information
                provided on the form in its assessment.
              </p>
              <p>
                If granted permission to participate, you may be permitted to

                The Board’s role includes promoting safety and security,
                economic efficiency, and environmental protection in the
                Canadian public interest. The Board considers environmental
                protection as a component of the public interest and has
                included it as a goal in the NEB Strategic Plan:

              <p>
                Yes. Since its inception in&nbsp;1959, the NEB has always
                considered the environment when making regulatory decisions. The
                NEB has significant experience in considering potential
                environmental effects by conducting EAs and has been doing so
                long before the 1995
                <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</em> (CEA Act) came
                into force.

                under the NEB Act for proposed facilities under its
                jurisdiction, including this project.

                The NEB continues to conduct EAs for proposed NEB-regulated

                of the environment and Canadians and will continue to perform
                this important assessment under the NEB Act even when an EA is
                not triggered by the

              <p>
                The NEB conducts an EA as part of its review of applications for
                projects under its jurisdiction. The NEB considers many factors,
                including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>physical and meteorological environment</li>
                <li>soil, soil productivity and vegetation</li>
                <li>wetlands, water quality and quantity</li>
                <li>fish, wildlife, and their habitat</li>
                <li>
                  species at risk or species of special status and related
                  habitat
                </li>
                <li>heritage resources</li>
                <li>traditional land and resource use</li>
                <li>human health, aesthetics and noise</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The EA considers the likely environmental effects, the adequacy
                of proposed mitigation measures to protect the environment, and
                the significance of effects after the mitigation measures are
                implemented. The Board commonly imposes additional conditions on
                most proposed projects to ensure environmental protection
                measures are sufficient and certain.

              <p>
                The NEB puts safety and environmental protection at the
                forefront of its responsibilities in protecting Canadians, and
                expects the companies it regulates to continually assess and
                continually improve their safety and environmental performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The NEB’s dedication to pipeline safety and security continues
                after a project is approved. The Board regulates pipelines
                throughout their lifecycle, from application to abandonment, to
                ensure companies remain effective in managing safety and
                environmental protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                The NEB holds companies accountable for results in the public
                interest using a rigorous compliance monitoring and enforcement
                program, which includes compliance audits and the inspection of
                construction and operating facilities. When a violation or an
                unsafe condition is detected, the NEB expects immediate
                correction and an assessment of the root causes in order to
                prevent the issue from happening again. Failure to address a
                violation or unsafe condition can result in further NEB
                sanction, such as suspension of operation.

                The NEB’s focus is on preventing accidents from happening in the
                first place. The NEB expects regulated companies to strive for
                zero spills or releases. However, should an incident occur, the
                NEB’s top priority is the safety and security of people, as well
                as the protection of the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each regulated company must maintain an up-to-date emergency
                procedure manual outlining the company emergency management
                procedures to be followed during an incident. The procedures
                must address emergency management, environmental protection, and
                worker and public safety. This plan must be on file with the NEB
                and the Transportation Safety Board (TSB).
              </p>
              <p>
                Companies are responsible for reporting the incident to the TSB
                and the NEB and for implementing their emergency response plan.
                The Board would then initiate its incident response procedures,
                which may include activation of its Emergency Operations Centre
                where appropriate.

                The NEB will verify that a company conducts an adequate and
                appropriate clean-up and remediation of any environmental
                effects resulting from the incident.

              <p>
                Yes, the application includes a revision to the Line&nbsp;9
                Rules and Regulations Tariff to allow the transportation of
                heavy crude. This revision will be part of the Board’s decision
                regarding the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                In making its decision on the project, the Board will consider a
                number of factors including the nature of the product in the
                pipeline. Incident response plans are expected to consider the
                nature of the product(s) in a pipeline.

<p>To: All Electricity Companies under the National Energy Board's Jurisdiction and 
All Interested Parties</p>
<p>Dear Stakeholder:</p>
<p><strong>Summary Report of the June&nbsp;2005 Electricity Cost Recovery Workshop</strong></p>
<p>Please find attached a summary report of the most recent industry workshop addressing 
cost recovery for the electricity industry. At this second workshop, a number of options 
and criteria were discussed in further detail. The summary report reflects the presentations, 
comments and discussion that took place. The report and other relevant documents are 
available on our Web site under <em>Engaging Canadians</em> and <em>Electricity Cost Recovery Review</em> (www.neb-one.gc.ca).</p>
<p>We invite you to submit your comments on the options presented in the report. You 
may also choose to provide an impact assessment of these options, to help the Board 
understand more clearly how these options might affect your operations. If you require 
background information to assist you in preparing your comments, the Board can provide 
nameplate capacity for the international power lines under its jurisdiction. Any feedback 
should be submitted by mail, courier or facsimile to the Board Secretary, Michel&nbsp;Mantha, by 7&nbsp;September&nbsp;2005.</p>
<p>The Board is in the process of developing the cost recovery concept based on the 
options and criteria discussed at the workshop. Your input will be helpful as this 
work gets underway. We anticipate that another workshop will be held in the late fall 
of&nbsp;2005 to present the draft cost recovery concept. An invitation to this meeting 
will be sent to you once the details are finalized.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact 
me as indicated below:</p>

<h2 id="executive_summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The National Energy Board's (NEB, the Board) Electricity Cost Recovery project 
was initiated in March&nbsp;2004 as a result of the electricity industry expressing 
concerns about the cost recovery process, and requested a review of the methodology. 
The electricity industry members requesting the review believe that the current methodology 
is not equitable, since exporters are the only group paying NEB costs. These members 
also believe that the restructuring of the industry resulting in the separation of 
generation, transmission, distribution and marketing functions means that it is critical 
for costs to be more appropriately distributed.</p>
<p>Following the industry request, the NEB organized a day-long workshop in Calgary 
on 9&nbsp;December&nbsp;2004 to explore the issue further with industry participants. 
About 25&nbsp;industry participants and Board representatives participated in the 
workshop. A second workshop was held on 2&nbsp;June&nbsp;2005 in Montreal, and was 
attended by 22&nbsp;industry participants. At this workshop, Board staff provided 
additional background information and presented some draft options and criteria for 
industry's input and feedback.</p>
<p>This Workshop Summary Report provides a summary of the discussion at the workshop. 
The report is intended to reflect participants' comments in their own words, and the 
use of terminology in the report is consistent with participants' remarks. For clarification, 
it should be noted that the NEB only has jurisdiction over exporters and International 
Transmission Lines (IPLs), and so any reference to transmission owners in the report 
would only apply to transmission owners with international facilities.</p>
<p>There were a number of principles that industry participants supported, for example, 
the user pay principle, especially for all applicants to pay the costs associated 
with their application. There was support for the following application cost options 
in principle.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Application Costs</strong></p>
<img src="/bts/cstrcvr/archive/mg/2005-08-04lctrctcstrcvrrprt-02-eng.jpg" alt="Application Costs" class="center-block">
<p><strong>Non Application Costs</strong></p>
<p>The group agreed that addressing cost recovery for applications was the easiest 
part of the process. Non-application costs were more difficult to address. With regard 
to non-application costs there was also support from industry for the principle that 
beneficiaries of services should pay for them. The following principles related to 
non-application costs were supported by the industry participants and were captured 
as follows.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Non Application Costs</strong></p>
<img src="/bts/cstrcvr/archive/mg/2005-08-04lctrctcstrcvrrprt-01-eng.jpg" alt="Non-application Costs" class="center-block">
<p>Board staff put forward the following possible criteria to ensure the effectiveness 
of the solution and industry participants provided a range of feedback on the criteria 
presented.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compliance with legislative and other requirements</li>
<li>Operational simplicity</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Predictability/stability of charges</li>
</ul>
<p>Board staff indicated that as part of the regulation amendment process, it was 
required to conduct an impact assessment to assess the economic, social, environmental 
and health impacts of the proposed changes on Canadian society. Board staff requested 
industry participants (individually or as a group) to provide their views on any potential 
impacts of these changes, along with their position and supporting rationale on any 
of the options discussed at the workshop. A written document should be formally submitted 
to the Board Secretary, Michel&nbsp;Mantha.</p>
<p>In the meantime, research on methodologies and service standards in other countries 
is being conducted. Board staff plans to make a draft concept available for review 
by industry in the fall of&nbsp;2005.</p>

fees for some customers, volume based for others), with the exception regarding &quot;border

<h2 id="neb_presentations">NEB Presentations</h2>
<h3 id="cost_recovery_regulation">Cost Recovery Regulations</h3>
<p><strong>Chantal Briand, Regulatory Development Analyst and Assistant Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>The regulatory process involves six&nbsp;phases, from conception and development 
to implementation. Stakeholder consultation occurs in the first four&nbsp;phases: 
conception and development; drafting the regulations; examination by Justice and the 
Privy Council Office; and Pre-publication in the <em>Canada Gazette, Part&nbsp;1</em>.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/U-3.7/index.html" rel="external"><em>User Fees Act</em></a> (UFA) promulgated in&nbsp;2004 may apply in making regulatory changes to the NEB cost recovery for the electricity industry. Currently, Parks Canada is the first agency to have implemented the requirements of this act, but their mandate 
is so different from that of NEB that it is not clear as to whether or to what degree 
the UFA would be applicable. If applicable, the UFA would overlay an additional regulatory process. While this may result in an increased political aspect, the UFA would not 
impose any substantive requirements or restrictions for determining the fees involved.</p>
<p>During group discussion, Board staff was asked about the relationship between the 
UFA and the cost recovery regulations. Board staff indicated that the principle behind 
the UFA was that the user of services should pay for those services. Board staff noted 
that the UFA was the result of a Private Member's Bill and that the government was 
not involved in drafting the act, so the Department of Justice and the Treasury Board 
are less familiar with it compared to other legislation. The Board will be monitoring 
the situation and will be ready to address the UFA's requirements, if necessary.</p>
<p>An industry participant asked about the changes in the Policy on Service Standards 
for External Fees. This policy replaced the External Charging Policy in November&nbsp;2004, 
since the previous policy was not compatible with the UFA. The new policy allows for 
flexibility in its application.</p>
<p>Board staff was asked about representation from other areas of government at the 
workshop. While there were two&nbsp;provincial regulatory bodies represented at the 
workshop, no federal bodies other than the NEB were in attendance. Board staff indicated 
that it is unusual for federal departments to be involved so early in the process. 
However, these departments have and will continue to receive all the information about 
the cost recovery project and will be kept up-to-date on the process. Board staff 
indicated that since the Board has hired a consultant to assist with the drafting 
of the new cost recovery regulations, perhaps it was less critical for the Department 
of Justice to attend the workshop as the department would normally be directly involved 
in drafting the new regulations. In the case of Natural Resources Canada, the department 
is not directly involved and any changes from the cost recovery project would only 
result in an administrative process for them. The Treasury Board is the body that 
is ultimately responsible, and the NEB will continue to keep them informed in a timely 
manner.</p>
<h3 id="demystifying_cost_recovery_fees">De-mystifying Cost Recovery Fees</h3>
<p><strong>Dan Philips, Team Leader, Finance</strong></p>
<p>Not all costs incurred by the Board are recoverable. About 10&nbsp;percent of the 
NEB's costs are nonrecoverable; these costs are related to frontier areas, work on 
behalf of other departments or agencies, and their associated overheads. In&nbsp;2003, 
total NEB costs were $40.9&nbsp;million. Electricity costs amounted to $4.3&nbsp;million, 
about 10&nbsp;percent of total costs. Electricity costs are rising relative to the 
other sectors. Industry participants commented that the increased costs should not 
be associated with export costs, since export volumes have been decreasing. Board 
staff noted that there have been four&nbsp;new IPL applications since&nbsp;2001, with 
a long period prior to that with no applications. These applications have driven costs 
up.</p>
<p>For cost recovery, the Board uses the calendar year, even though its fiscal year 
ends March&nbsp;31. Recoverable costs are defined by regulations (frontier costs are 
excluded by Order of the Board). The Board's costs are very labor intensive. About 
75&nbsp;percent of recoverable costs are associated with staff compensation. The remainder 
involves operating and maintenance expenses. The Auditor General performs an annual 
audit of the NEB's costs.</p>
<p>Currently, energy companies pay their share of recoverable costs in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greenfield levies (for pipeline start-ups only), or</li>
<li>Fixed fees (small and intermediate pipeline companies and electricity exporters), 
or</li>
<li>Sharing the remaining pool of costs by commodity sector</li>
</ul>
<p>These last costs are allocated according to how much time Board staff spend on 
each sector. Specific hours are recorded, not percentages of time. All NEB staff, 
including Board members, use time reports to track their hours by commodity, but individual 
projects are not generally tracked. Board staff indicated that it would be possible 
to track individual projects such as facilities applications or export permits. There 
is some work that cannot be allocated to a specific sector because it relates to all 
the commodities, for example, Aboriginal consultation. Shared costs are based on activity, 
rather than dollars. In the case of electricity, the activity measure is MW.h; for 
pipelines, it is throughput volumes.</p>
<p>Board staff clarified that the greenfield fee applies to pipelines only - and only 
to pipeline companies that are not presently regulated by the NEB. The fee is a percentage 
of the capital cost of the project, and there is no connection to the cost of any 
hearing that may be required. Furthermore, the fee is only payable if the application 
is approved. If the application is denied, then the costs associated with the hearing 
are recovered from the Board's regulated companies. Once greenfield facilities are 
in-service, the pipeline company shares in the allocation of throughput costs with 
other industry participants.</p>
<p>A Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) representative wondered if it would be 
possible to develop an electricity cost recovery concept that would include application 
fees. There was support from the industry participants for all application costs being 
paid by the applicant. Board staff indicated that it is not presently possible to 
recover application costs from unsuccessful applicants that are not regulated by the 
Board. Recovery of application costs from such unsuccessful applicants would require 
a change to the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-7/index.html" rel="external"><em>National Energy Board Act</em></a> and would take longer to accomplish than changes to the cost recovery regulations. Industry participants indicated that they would be interested in promoting this option for the long-term. Board staff indicated that it would bring this to the Board's attention.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks indicated it supports the user pay principle, including recovering 
costs associated with any denied application. Board staff indicated that Sumas was 
an unusual case, and that it is not often that hearing costs are so high and the application 
is not approved. Usually, when an application is denied, the proponent revises and 
resubmits the application.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks reiterated its support for the principle that the costs associated 
with a public hearing such as Sumas should be borne by the applicant. Coral Energy 
also supported the user pay concept and added that focusing on the bottom of the allocation 
'cascade' creates concerns among the players. Those concerns would be alleviated somewhat 
if some costs were allocated further up the cascade, especially if applicants are 
required to pay hearing costs. This would result in reduced costs to be shared by 
industry participants.</p>
<p>A clarifying question was asked about the current process that requires a four-year 
rolling average to determine costs. Board staff confirmed that four&nbsp;years are 
involved: actuals for the two&nbsp;previous years, a current year estimate and forecast 
for the following year. The Board estimates its costs and adjusts the estimate when 
costs are finalized.</p>
<p>Board staff was asked where accountability lies for its budget. It was confirmed 
that the budget is approved by Parliament and that the Board is accountable to Parliament. 
However, collected cost recovery monies are not returned to the NEB, they go into 
the government's general revenues. It was also confirmed that the Board itself does 
not function as a board of directors; it is a regulatory board.</p>
<p>It was noted that there is also a Cost Recovery Liaison Committee that meets regularly, 
comprised of energy industry representatives and other stakeholders such as consumer 
groups. The electricity industry is represented by CEA on this committee, but membership 
is open to other electricity industry participants as well. Interest in participating 
has increased over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>The Cost Recovery Liaison Committee provides input on costs as well as other issues. 
For example, when the Board is seeking increased funding from Parliament, input from 
the Cost Recovery Liaison Committee is sought. The last time, the committee told the 
Board that it was being too conservative in its request. Some committee members wrote 
letters supporting additional funding. Committee input is also sought on staffing 
level issues and salary levels.</p>
<p>Board staff was asked about the role of the Auditor General. The Auditor General 
provides a critical function as it performs an annual audit of the NEB's costs and 
time reporting as well, since the latter is a proxy for costs. The NEB financial statements 
are tabled at the Cost Recovery Liaison Committee and are also posted on the NEB's 
Web site.</p>
<p>Board staff also noted that setting priorities is a management decision and that 
the executive team determines projects. An annual strategic planning session is held 
in the fall. The Board is largely driven by industry activities such as the number 
of applications submitted. In a year with many activities, the Board must reassess 
its priorities and reallocate workloads to adapt to emerging situations.</p>
<p>Board staff noted that it needs to keep two&nbsp;different sets of books -&nbsp;one 
to reflect its fiscal year ending March&nbsp;31, the other to reflect its recoverable 
costs, which are based on the calendar year. Board staff asked industry participants 
if there would be any objection in shifting to a single set of books for both. Industry 
participants appeared to have no problem in moving to a single set of books based 
on the NEB fiscal year.</p>
<h3 id="overview_electricity_program">Overview of Electricity Program</h3>
<p><strong>Bob Modray, Technical Specialist, Economics and Energy Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The NEB's mandate for electricity is included in the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and there are responsibilities under the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-15.2/index.html" rel="external"><em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</em></a> (CEA Act). The NEB Act was recently amended following the implementation of the <em>Public Safety Act, 2002</em>. This 
will have implications for the NEB's oversight of facilities under its jurisdiction, 
including international power lines and will also impact the industry.</p>
<p>The Canadian Electricity Policy was created in&nbsp;1988 to respond to industry 
restructuring and to support the shift to a market-based approach to regulating electricity. 
In response, the NEB Act was revised in&nbsp;1990. For example, the need for prescriptive 
tests to determine if exports are surplus to domestic needs was removed. There have 
been no export hearings since&nbsp;1990. All export applications have been handled 
on a permit basis. Export applications have tended to be more straightforward than 
applications for new IPLs. There is also ongoing regulatory work, including meetings 
requested by potential applicants.</p>
<p>The Board's responsibilities related to IPLs have been evolving, and now may address 
reliability and security issues. The Board was directly involved in the Canada-U.S. 
blackout task force and there is ongoing work in support of a federal/provincial/territorial 
reliability subcommittee. Board staff indicated that it is concerned with the reliability 
of the IPL only - but there is a broader impact on the provincial system. There are 
reliability benefits for the rest of the system associated with IPLs. The Board is 
interested in understanding reliability issues and the impact of North American Electric 
Reliability Council (NERC) standards, but indicated that the boundaries of authority 
between federal and provincial jurisdiction in this regard are not always clear.</p>
<p>A CEA representative wondered about the costs associated with the new security 
legislation and Board staff indicated that it was too early to determine all related 
costs now; the costs so far would relate mainly to the changes to the NEB Act. The 
changes empower the Board to make regulations on security. Board staff also indicated 
that there has been no increase in its budget to address security issues, and that 
resources will need to be reallocated. Board staff was asked whether security expenses 
would be recoverable and Board staff indicated they are recoverable.</p>
<p>A discussion about exports ensued. Board staff was asked whether there is a connection 
between the volume of exports and the number of export applications. Board staff indicated 
that the number of applications varies from&nbsp;year to&nbsp;year and the number 
of applications is what drives the Board's work - not export volumes. Board staff 
was asked how many export applications are 'reactive', i.e., applying for a licence 
'just in case'. There is no annual fee to maintain a licence, but small exporters 
only pay a flat fee of $500, no matter how many licences they hold.</p>
<p>IPL applications are more involved and take more time. There have been four&nbsp;IPL 
applications in recent years, three of which resulted in public hearings. This compares 
with only a single IPL hearing during the&nbsp;1990s.</p>
<p>A further discussion ensued about the Board's market monitoring activities. This 
issue was also raised at the workshop last December. Market monitoring activities 
arise out of the Board's mandate to provide an advisory function and to inform the 
public about the functioning of energy markets. The Board's monitoring function involves 
assessing issues and trends. In this way it is different from the type of monitoring 
carried out by Market Surveillance Administrators (MSAs) in some jurisdictions. MSAs 
seek out abuses of market power and ways to improve the effective operation of electricity 
markets.</p>
<p>Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie asked whether the information gathered 
during market monitoring activities could be directly applied to the Board's processing 
of export permits. Board staff indicated that the information is not used directly 
for processing applications, but that the reports are helpful in educating potential 
interveners and others about how the market works and what the issues are. This work 
assists Board Members and staff in carrying out their regulatory responsibilities. 
Market monitoring activities promote understanding of energy markets and the Board 
believes that this helps markets to function more efficiently.</p>
<p>Board staff indicated that its market monitoring activities do not include a survey 
of prices and that it would be difficult to allocate market monitoring costs to a 
specific sector. Board staff was also asked whether it had a test to determine if 
markets are working. Do Canadians have fair market access, for example? If the NEB 
decides that Canadians do not have fair market access, would or could exports be stopped? 
Board staff responded that in some cases, price data are available to help assess 
whether markets are working; if consumers are not being offered fair market access 
they can complain to the NEB. If an exporter is found to contravene the permit (e.g.,&nbsp;fair 
market access is not offered), then presumably the permit could be revoked (and exports 
terminated).</p>
<p>Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie wondered whether fair market access was 
a reasonable criterion for Board staff to use in evaluating export applications. Reciprocity 
conditions might be a better criterion. Board staff indicated that reciprocity is 
a U.S. condition, not a Canadian one. For fair market access, the Board looks at whether 
Canadians can get access to electricity under similar conditions as the export market.</p>
<p>Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie also wondered whether the Board could stop 
exports, for example, if Ontario needed extra power. Board staff indicated that this 
scenario would need to be considered in the context of fair market access.</p>
<p>Board staff indicated that it is anticipating multi-commodity/convergence issues 
in the energy industry, for example, the implications of oil sands developments for 
natural gas cogeneration and electric transmission. Board staff also commented that 
FERC&nbsp;Order&nbsp;888 required players in the U.S. market to unbundle their systems 
and offer access on a fair basis to everyone. There are also more players now, partly 
resulting from the utility unbundling. So the issues are becoming increasingly complex 
and the Board needs a good understanding of them.</p>
<p>Board staff indicated that there is currently a trend toward decreasing exports 
and increasing imports .This results from Canadian generation capability not keeping 
pace with growing domestic electricity demand. For example, in August&nbsp;2002, Ontario 
was short of supply and had to import power. Other provinces have taken advantage 
of IPLs to import power because of drought conditions and economic opportunities that 
favour importing instead of using domestic generation. There have been 50-60&nbsp;TW.h 
of electricity transfers (exports plus imports) in recent years. Hydro One Networks 
noted that it is not the responsibility of IPL owners to address shortfalls.</p>
<p>Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie asked whether export volumes are based 
on net or gross numbers. Board staff noted that import volumes are not factored in. 
The calculation is based on gross export volumes with one exception, equichange agreements. 
Equichange agreements require that exports and imports balance out over time; however, 
in a given reporting period, net exports (exports minus imports) are utilized for 
cost recovery calculations.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>During the afternoon, Board staff and industry participants discussed a variety 
of possible options (mechanisms) that could be used in combination to create a concept 
or complete solution to address cost recovery. A number of these options had been 
proposed by industry participants at the December workshop. The following options 
were discussed:</p>
<p>New IPL application fee/greenfield fee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay actual estimated costs for each hearing (based on number of staff hours)</li>
<li>Pay flat fee for category&nbsp;1, 2 and&nbsp;3 (category relates to the length 
or complexity of the hearing and would be decided at the end of the hearing with input 
from the company)</li>
<li>Greenfield fee -&nbsp;form of application fee, based on the following potential 
parameters: facility, voltage level, name plate capacity, capital cost</li>
</ul>
<p>Export authorization fee</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat fee for export permits</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-application costs (all other costs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Transmission companies pay on installed capacity</li>
<li>Transmission companies pay based on volumes of exports plus imports (net line 
utilization)</li>
<li>Transmission companies pay based on existing IPL rated MW or&nbsp;MW.h</li>
<li>NEB services (monthly export returns, market monitoring, etc.) paid by those who 
benefit from them</li>
<li>Straight ratio (%&nbsp;for transmission companies and %&nbsp;for exporters)</li>
<li>Increased annual charge for small and intermediate exporters</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="application_costs">Application Costs</h4>
<p>Board staff was asked how the cost of hiring consultants was addressed. Board staff 
indicated that the cost for consultants comes out of operating costs and that these 
costs are minor.</p>
<p>Board staff was asked about the gap between actual costs and estimated costs based 
on employee time allocation. The industry participants agreed that it is not necessary 
to have a 100&nbsp;percent solution; a 75-80&nbsp;percent achievement of the objectives 
was adequate. The Ontario Energy Board indicated that other regulators have used hours 
as a proxy. Few regulatory bodies try to track actual compensation costs. There was 
general support for the NEB to transition to a new time tracking system to track individual 
staff hours for each application, including export permits that require a hearing.</p>
<p>Board staff was asked if options related to application costs straddled over different 
fiscal years would be an issue. Board staff indicated that a hearing can take place 
sometimes over a 2-3&nbsp;year period and that multiple years could be accommodated.</p>
<p>How are staffing issues addressed? Board staff indicated that it works in project 
teams and 'borrows' staff based on volume of work. All staff allocate their hours 
among the three commodities. While projects are not generally tracked, it would not 
be difficult to add a new project to the tracking system. There was general support 
from the industry participants for the NEB to track staff hours for each electricity 
application; this would include applications for both export permits and IPL certificates.</p>
<p>Board staff was asked whether estimates are forward 'guesses' or based on existing 
data. Board staff indicated that its estimates were based on actual data and that 
it is impossible to predict how a hearing will go.</p>
<p>While it is possible to track staff time associated with applications, it would 
be more difficult to track other operating costs such as hearing rooms without making 
some major revisions to the NEB accounting system.</p>
<p>Coral Energy noted that it did not make sense to tie application fees to the capital 
cost or other aspects of the project. What needs to be captured are the NEB's costs. 
The NEB's costs are not necessarily driven by capital cost, voltage or other aspects 
of a proposed project.</p>
<p>There was support from Hydro One Networks and Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie 
for IPL applicants to pay the actual costs for their hearings. NB Power Transmission 
Corporation wondered whether the application fees could be applied to all new IPL 
facilities, regardless of whether the applicant currently comes under the Board's 
jurisdiction or not.</p>
<p>While the industry participants supported the concept of all IPL applicants paying 
hearing costs, Board staff noted that it cannot charge a fee to an unsuccessful applicant 
that does not hold a Board authorization. Over the long term, there legislation would 
need to be changed to allow fees to be recovered from companies that are not regulated 
by the Board.</p>
<p>The industry participants were concerned about the recovery of costs associated 
with an unsuccessful application by an unregulated company such as Sumas. Board staff 
noted that this rarely occurs. Board staff noted that the Sumas application took a 
lot of the Board's time and that the cost of the application was higher than the cost 
of the IPL. Hydro One Networks questioned why other companies should subsidize those 
costs.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks indicated its support for full cost allocation to the applicant 
for all projects including exports as well as transmission lines. When there is a 
hearing or extended process associated with exports, the associated costs should also 
be determined and recovered from the applicant. However, there has been no hearing 
for exports since&nbsp;1990 and processing export applications may be fairly routine.</p>
<p>Ontario Power Generation noted that if export applications are now routine, it 
would be easy to calculate the cost based on staff hours as a proxy. Hydro One Networks 
indicated its support for this approach, but suggested that a flat fee could be created 
that would approximate the costs. Ontario Power Generation added that if a hearing 
is required, there could be a substantial increase in costs.</p>
<p>Board staff asked the industry participants how a flat export application fee could 
be determined. Hydro One Networks indicated that staff costs based on employee time 
could be tracked for a&nbsp;year or&nbsp;two. Board staff added that tracking could 
take place before the regulatory changes are implemented, and a baseline average could 
be determined.</p>
<p>Manitoba Hydro noted that in that province there is a very small export licence 
at the border for about 20&nbsp;kW and questioned whether such a small export amount 
should trigger an export fee based on the average application costs. Manitoba Hydro 
indicated it would almost be tempted to cancel the licence. Board staff suggested 
using another criterion such as single phase vs three phase or voltage level. There 
was a discussion about possible exemptions for very small export volumes. Powerex 
and Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie supported a minimum capacity or volume 
below which there would be no fee.</p>
<p>In summary, there were a number of principles that the industry participants suggested, 
for example, the user pay principle, especially for all applicants to pay the costs 
associated with their application. The industry participants also agreed that a transition 
period would likely be necessary. There was support for the following options in principle.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Application Costs</strong></p>
<img src="/bts/cstrcvr/archive/mg/2005-08-04lctrctcstrcvrrprt-02-eng.jpg" alt="Application Costs" class="center-block">
<h4 id="non_application_costs">Non-Application Costs</h4>
<p>The group agreed that addressing cost recovery for applications was the easiest 
part of the process. Non-application costs were more difficult to address. These costs 
include market monitoring, export returns and other non-allocated costs. These costs 
could also fluctuate.</p>
<p>With regard to non-application costs, there was also support from the industry 
participants for the principle that beneficiaries of services should pay for them. 
There was a significant discussion about the services provided by the Board and who 
benefits from them or causes them. There was a discussion about basing non-application 
costs on installed transmission capacity, and whether that would be the combined transfer 
capability or the nameplate capacity of the individual IPL. Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie 
indicated that it did not support any solution that would use total installed transmission 
capacity as a basis for non-application costs. Neither would the Board have jurisdiction 
to mandate that approach, since the Board only has jurisdiction over IPLs. Both Trans&Eacute;nergie 
and Brascan Energy Marketing supported utilization rather than installed IPL capacity 
as a basis for cost recovery. Brascan Energy Marketing also noted that if the well-being 
of the Canadian consumer is being protected, then consumers are the ones who should 
be charged, perhaps through distribution companies somehow.</p>
<p>Powerex noted that if installed capacity was used as a basis, then exporters would 
be paying some portion of the costs through transmission tariffs. Powerex added that 
there could be a different mechanism to capture value in transmission rates that could 
reflect the benefits to importers as well as reliability benefits. Board staff noted 
that nameplate capacity is auditable and stable. NB Power Transmission did not support 
a solution based on installed capacity, noting that it was building an interconnection 
that would function at a lower capacity than its nameplate rating because of restrictions 
in the U.S. market. Manitoba Hydro indicated that installed capacity or something 
similar would be the best proxy of value, since it provides a fair representation 
among all transmission companies and the costs would be shared on a relative basis, 
in any case. Manitoba Hydro said this approach is fair because the decision on how 
large to size an IPL is a conscious decision, i.e., if the utility designs it with 
an installed capacity greater than the level of exports that can be supported by the 
system, that's a choice, not an obligation. During this discussion, Manitoba Hydro 
indicated that information such as nameplate capacity or simultaneous transfer capacity 
might be useful in determining the extent of cost shifts that would result from changing 
the cost recovery methodology. NB Power Transmission also wanted to review the data 
to see if, indeed, that were the case.</p>
<p>Board staff asked whether the industry participants wanted to make a distinction 
between small, intermediate and large companies for the purposes of recovering non-application 
costs. Hydro One Networks indicated that there should not be any distinction unless 
one group is underpaying their share. Powerex added that if allocation is on a capacity 
basis, that would essentially create that distinction. Some industry participants 
indicated that dropping the intermediate category could be appropriate.</p>
<p>Board staff wondered whether having the NEB decide an allocation based on beneficiaries 
was appropriate. Each region might have different systems and different beneficiaries. 
Perhaps each province should determine who should be paying. Manitoba Hydro suggested 
a two-step cost allocation process, with the first step to allocate costs to each 
jurisdiction. Then each transmission provider could determine with their provincial 
regulator how to reallocate the costs. The point was made that ultimately provincial 
regulators would be in control of if and how costs would be passed on if they were 
initially charged to transmission companies.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks indicated that their transmission rates are 'postage stamp', 
so there might not be a meaningful reallocation to beneficiaries. The Ontario Energy 
Board added that while they do not handle rate cases every year, there is cost recovery 
of general costs, and that from their perspective, it would make sense for cost reallocation 
to be determined by provincial regulators. There was an ensuing discussion about the 
appropriate entities to be charged by the Board, since the Independent System Operators 
(ISOs), where applicable, are responsible for reliability, a factor associated with 
benefits. It was noted that FERC charges both the ISOs and the Transmission Facilities 
Owners (TFOs) for recovery of costs. The Independent Electricity System Operator of 
Ontario (IESO) noted that it doesn't own or operate facilities and that they are not 
regulated by the NEB. The IESO suggested that a given solution shouldn't be adopted 
just because it is easy to implement.</p>
<p>Coral Energy noted that both the TFOs and ISOs are not the ultimate beneficiaries 
for non-application costs and that the provinces are in the best position to make 
that decision.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks asked who the beneficiaries are for export returns. Board staff 
indicated that it was a statutory requirement to provide this information. Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec 
Production noted that it was not a beneficiary of these reports since it supplied 
the data in the first place.</p>
<p>It was noted by the industry participants that the criterion of causality works 
well with applications but not with other costs. These are charges the Board incurs 
because of its specific mandate. There is a need to focus on equity and a mechanism 
to determine who should pay. It was suggested by some industry participants that it 
would not be fair to shift all costs to IPLs. There could be discussion all day about 
beneficiaries without any resolution. It could be consumers; it could ultimately be 
the economy of Canada.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks wanted to see some kind of equitable allocation for material/substantive 
costs, with as much allocated as possible according to beneficiaries. Board staff 
asked what would constitute material or substantive costs. Hydro One Networks indicated 
that monthly export returns, at eight percent of the Board's costs, would be considered 
substantive. Perhaps monthly export returns could be worked back into application 
costs since the returns are required for the exporters to maintain their permits. 
After all the costs have been allocated this way, the remaining costs should be divided 
equitably somehow.</p>
<p>The largest component of non-application costs is market monitoring. There was 
a long discussion about who benefits from this work. The work does help the Board 
and thus indirectly benefits exporters/marketers and IPLs. It was suggested by some 
industry participants that these two&nbsp;groups could share those costs based on 
some kind of ratio that reflects the amount of work undertaken by the Board. Such 
ratio could be reviewed on a regular basis to determine if they are still appropriate 
and the ratio changed as necessary. That would address almost half of the non-application 
costs. That solution might be acceptable to everyone, including customers and there 
would be no shifting of the burden from one sector to another. Some industry participants 
also indicated that shifting the total burden to the IPLs might not be perceived well 
by the provincial regulator, although that might work for a transitional period. It 
was not clear whether all provincial regulators would approve IPL costs being passed 
through to customers. Hydro One Networks noted that regulators could ask the IPL to 
offset the cost elsewhere.</p>
<p>Ontario Power Generation wondered whether it would be easy to change the ratio 
as required. Board staff indicated that the regulation could be written in such a 
manner to allow some flexibility. Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie supported 
the principle of using criteria in the regulation, so that the numbers can be adjusted 
as appropriate. The Ontario Energy Board noted that it has a new cost recovery model 
with an extremely simple one-page&nbsp;regulation that allows significant discretion. 
Board staff noted that the current regulation provides some discretion, but that the 
NEB Act requires that the manner of calculating charges be stated in the regulation. 
The following principles were supported by the industry participants and were captured 
as follows.</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>Non Application Costs</strong></p>
<img src="/bts/cstrcvr/archive/mg/2005-08-04lctrctcstrcvrrprt-01-eng.jpg" alt="Non-application Costs" class="center-block">
<p>Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie noted that the definition of beneficiaries 
and benefits is very important, and that 'benefits' really relate to the reasons why 
the Board is undertaking a certain activity. Why is the Board doing market monitoring? 
Is it truly to determine if the market is working in Canada? Rather, the Board is 
mandated to undertake these activities. It is a cost of business due to companies 
that are required to be regulated by the Board. Coral Energy believed that the people 
of Canada are the true beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks believed that market assessments are done to help the Board 
make decisions on export permits and that is how those costs should be allocated. 
Others believed that the costs could not be associated with a direct beneficiary. 
Board staff noted that these non-application costs need to be recovered in some manner, 
regardless of whether there is a perceived direct benefit or not.</p>
<h3 id="driteria">Criteria</h3>
<p>To help create the most effective solution, Board staff suggested the following 
criteria and asked for industry's input.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compliance with legislative and other requirements</li>
<li>Operational simplicity</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Predictability/stability of charges</li>
</ul>
<p>Hydro One Networks suggested that it should be possible to change the legislation, 
but Board staff noted that that was not an option at the moment, although it could 
be considered for the long term. There was agreement that predictability and stability 
of charges was desirable and the four-year rolling average was a good mechanism.</p>
<p>Board staff asked if there were any other criteria that should be considered such 
as flexibility. Hydro One Networks noted that equity was an important criterion and 
that flexibility was an enabler to achieve equity.</p>
<p>Board staff raised the issue of the transparency of the parameters used such as 
numbers related to transmission capacity. From what authority should the numbers be 
derived? Would reliability council data be acceptable? Would industry accept numbers 
from a utility in another province or numbers supported by the local provincial regulator? 
Powerex noted that NERC provides a bigger picture and that path ratings tweaking will 
not happen.</p>
<p>The industry participants indicated that cost causation is also a criterion and 
that cross-subsidization from one group to another should not occur.</p>
<p>When the industry participants were asked about the weighting of the criteria, 
Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Production indicated that equity should be the main driver. NB 
Power Transmission indicated that cost causation should be main driver, although that 
criterion may be linked to equity. Powerex also agreed about the relative importance 
of cost causation, while Brascan Energy Marketing supported equity as the main driver, 
as well as the ability to adjust to market conditions in the future. There was support 
for adaptability as an additional criterion.</p>
<p>Hydro One Networks identified equity as the most important criterion and cited 
as well the need to make the process fair and transparent.</p>
<p>Powerex supported the need for simplicity. The ultimate solution should not be 
too complicated or require significant additional costs to satisfy the process. This 
will also help make the solution more predictable/stable.</p>
<p>Powerex wanted clarification of what was meant by predictability/stability, whether 
it related to the measures, such as installed capacity, or to the costs charged to 
each sector. Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Production indicated that it could not relate to 
costs, since there was no way the costs associated with the Sumas 2 application could 
have been avoided. The company supported the principle that the measures should be 
predictable. Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Trans&Eacute;nergie suggested that cost shifting 
should be avoided. Manitoba Hydro indicated that since a two-year process was needed 
to confirm costs, there would be plenty of advance warning, and therefore the costs 
would be predictable. However, if there was any cost shifting among groups, the more 
quickly this was accomplished, the more equitable the process would be.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions_next_steps">Conclusions and Next Steps</h2>
<p>A draft summary report of the workshop will be distributed to industry participants 
for review to ensure its accuracy. Industry participants wanted two&nbsp;weeks to 
provide its comments. A written document should be formally submitted to the Board 
Secretary, Michel&nbsp;Mantha. Industry participants indicated their interest in moving 
the process along quickly and said they would be able to provide its input two&nbsp;weeks 
from the date that the draft summary report was made available.</p>
<p>Board staff indicated that as part of the regulation amendment process, it was 
required to conduct an impact assessment to assess the economic, social, environmental 
and health impacts of the proposed changes on Canadian society. Board staff requested 
industry participants (individually or as a group) provide their views on any potential 
impacts of these changes, along with their position on any of the options discussed 
at the workshop and supporting rationale. A written document should also be formally 
submitted to the Board Secretary, Michel&nbsp;Mantha.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Board staff will create a draft concept on cost recovery methodology 
and will make it available for review in the fall of&nbsp;2005. The industry participants 
were asked their preference for providing input and the industry indicated that another 
group meeting with an opportunity to provide written feedback would be appropriate.</p>
<p>Participants reiterated the need to be timely and move the process along as quickly 
as possible. Board staff indicated that hiring a consultant to draft the regulations 
and having him attend the workshop will help facilitate the process.</p>

Proposed Electricity Cost Recovery Options</h2>
<h3>Definitions:</h3>
<p><strong>Option:</strong> the means or mechanisms used to achieve the desired 
end result.</p>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> One or a combination of mechanisms, including 
details such as the formulas for how each mechanism will be applied.</p>
<h3>Proposed Options to amend the <em>Electricity Cost Recovery Regulations</em></h3>
<p><strong>New international transmission power line (IPL) application fee / Greenfield fees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pay actual estimated costs for each hearing (based on number of staff hours).</li>
<li>Pay flat fee for category&nbsp;1, 2 and&nbsp;3 (category relates to the length 
or complexity of the hearing and would be decided at the end of the hearing with input 
from the company).</li>
<li>Greenfield fees: form of application fee. Fees could be based on the following 
potential parameters:
<ul>
<li>Facility (e.g.,&nbsp;single&nbsp;phase or 3&nbsp;phases)</li>
<li>voltage level</li>
<li>name plate capacity of the line</li>
<li>capital cost to construct the line</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Export authorization fee</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flat application fee for export permits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-application costs (all other costs)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Transmission companies to pay based on installed capacity.</li>
<li>Transmission companies to pay based on the volume of exports or on exports plus 
imports (the total utilization of the line).</li>
<li>Transmission companies to pay based on existing IPL rated megawatts or megawatts/hour</li>
<li>NEB services (monthly export returns, market monitoring, etc) to be paid by those 
who benefit from them.</li>
<li>Straight ratio (%&nbsp;for transmission companies and %&nbsp;for exporters).</li>
<li>Increase the annual charge to small and intermediate electricity exporters.</li>
</ul>

<thead>
<tr>
<th class=" text-left  active">Criterion</th>
<th class=" text-left  active">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Compliance with legislative and other requirements</td>
<td>Collection of recoverable costs in compliance with applicable legislation: 
Section&nbsp;24.1(1) of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em>, <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, <em>User Fees Act</em> and related regulations, Government of Canada policy on Service Standards for External Fees, 29&nbsp;November&nbsp;2004.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Operational simplicity</td>
<td>The method should be relatively easy to implement and use for both 
the NEB and industry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Equity</td>
<td>The interests of various stakeholders should be balanced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Predictability /Stability of charges</td>
<td>Predictable revenues to cover the Board's annual expenses and to 
allow companies to predict with reasonable accuracy what their cost recovery bills 
will be in a given year (avoiding highly inconsistent annual cost recovery revenues 
and an undue administrative burden).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td height="22">Cost causation</td>
<td>This is based on the 'user pay' principle. To the extent possible, 
costs should flow to the parties who caused these costs to be incurred.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>Definition of criterion/criteria: A standard, rule, or test on which a judgment 
or decision can be based.</p>

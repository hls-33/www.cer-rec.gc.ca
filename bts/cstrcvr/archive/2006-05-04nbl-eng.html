            The Board recently completed an extensive consultation process on
            the proposed amendments to the
            <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em> in relation
            to electricity matters. Companies were invited to submit written
            comments on the proposed Electricity Cost Recovery Concept by
            24&nbsp;February&nbsp;2006. All of the comments received were
            considered by the Board, and as a result the Board has made some
            modifications to the concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please find attached a summary report of the proposed amendments to
            the <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em>,
            reflecting industry comments and tfhe Board's modifications to the
            concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is satisfied with the modified Electricity Cost Recovery
            Concept as the consultation process was transparent and the Concept
            is equitable. Thank you for your continued interest and positive
            contribution to the NEB's review of cost recovery regulations
            related to electricity matters.
          </p>

            Electricity Cost Recovery Concept<br />
            Project Background
          </h2>
          <p>
            On 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2004, five major electricity companies
            regulated by the National Energy Board (the NEB or the Board)
            requested the review of the NEB cost recovery methodology for the
            electricity industry. Those companies were Brascan Power,
            Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec Production, Manitoba Hydro, Ontario Power
            Generation Inc. and Powerex Corp.
          </p>
          <p>
            The companies stated that due to changes that have occurred and
            continue to occur in the Canadian electricity industry, the current
            cost recovery methodology ought to be revised in order to more
            equitably allocate the costs of the NEB's electricity programs. On
            14&nbsp;July&nbsp;2004, the Board committed to undertake a review of
            the <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em> (Cost
            Recovery Regulations) related to the electricity industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB began an extensive consultation process with a workshop in
            December&nbsp;2004 in Calgary. The purpose of this first workshop
            was to understand the issues raised by the electricity industry and
            explore possible solutions. Possible cost recovery options to amend
            the Cost Recovery Regulations were developed and presented for
            discussion at a second workshop with the industry that took place in
            June&nbsp;2005. The proposed Electricity Cost Recovery Concept
            (Concept) was approved by the Board in December&nbsp;2005 and
            presented to stakeholders at an information session held in Toronto
            19&nbsp;January&nbsp;2006.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Concept is based on the existing commodity charging approach
            using actual energy transmissions in MWh. This approach is
            consistent with the manner of cost recovery used for the oil and gas
            sector for which Board costs are also allocated on the basis of
            throughput. The Concept is also simple to develop and administer
            while being equitable. The following table summarizes the Concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the January information session, the electricity industry
            was given 30 days to comment on the proposed Concept. All the
            comments received were considered during the Board's decision-making
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report reflects the Board's consideration of those comments and
            it's approval of the modified Concept.

          <h4 id="c1">1. Annual Levy on International Power Line Companies</h4>
          <p>
            There was a general consensus amongst companies about the proposed
            measurement units in MWh; however some concerns were raised about
            using actual energy transmitted as opposed to other measurement
            parameters such as scheduled imports and exports, or capacity
            reserve. Some stakeholders also indicated that it would be unfair to
            include in the calculation inadvertent flows, loop flows,
            wheel-throughs, and imports.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is of the view that actual energy transmitted (exports and
            imports) in MWh as the allocation factor is the most valid
            measurement from the standpoint of actual power line utilization and
            that it can be readily measured and reported. As a result of the
            comments received, the Board concluded that inadvertent flows and
            loop flows should not be included in the calculation of actual
            energy transmission as such flows are not planned transmissions and
            are an outcome of system configuration and electricity properties.
            However, the Board is of the view that wheel-throughs should be
            considered in the calculation as these flows are planned energy
            transmissions.
          </p>
          <h4 id="c2">2. Power Line Company Classification</h4>
          <p>
            The Board did not receive any comments concerning the proposed
            company classifications. The modified Concept contains
            two&nbsp;company classifications -&nbsp;small and large. The
            distinction between the two would be that a small power line<sup
              id="fn1-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"

            company would operate one or more power lines over which,
            collectively, less&nbsp;than 50&nbsp;000&nbsp;MWh is transmitted per
            year and large power line company would operate one or more power
            lines over which, collectively, not less than 50&nbsp;000&nbsp;MWh
            is transmitted. The proposed Concept also contained a provision for
            the approval of border accommodation facilities that would have a
            one time fee of&nbsp;$500. The Board conducted further analysis
            regarding border accommodations and is of the view that the proposed
            change is not required. The Board decided that international power
            line companies transmitting 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;MWh or less per year
            would be exempt from a Board levy.
          </p>
          <h4 id="c3">
            3. Levy of 0.2% on Newly Regulated International Power Line
            Companies
          </h4>
          <p>
            Companies indicated that additional information was needed with
            regard to the percentage of the levy established by the Board. The
            stakeholders suggested that 0.2% of the capital cost of a project
            might not reflect actual NEB costs for a new application. They also
            noted that the issue of unsuccessful applicants paying no costs is
            not addressed by the proposed Concept and encouraged the Board to
            pursue this possibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is of the view that the 0.2% capital cost of a project
            represents an appropriate levy for newly regulated international
            power line companies and that it would not create a barrier for new
            entrants to the industry. It has not been the Board's intention to
            recover all of its actual costs when setting the levy and the Board
            is of the view that it would be inappropriate in relation to the
            Board's hearing processes and public interest mandate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the Board does not track actual NEB costs pursuant to a
            decision previously made by the Board and that was supported by the
            Cost Recovery Liaison Committee; implementing a system to track
            actual costs would impose additional costs associated with the
            administration of the cost recovery program.
          </p>
          <p>
            With regard to unsuccessful applications, appropriate amendments to
            the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) would be required
            to permit costs to be recovered from unsuccessful applicants and
            cannot be effectively done in the current amendments to the Cost
            Recovery Regulations. The Board acknowledges the concern raised by
            some companies and is open to consider the issue as a possible
            future amendment to the NEB Act.
          </p>
          <h4 id="c4">4. Year-End Change</h4>
          <p>
            No comments were received from the electricity industry on this
            matter. However, the Board received comments from the oil and gas
            sector noting the possible impact on annual toll setting processes.
            The Board is reviewing the comments and will address the matter
            shortly. This is not expected to delay the amendments in relation to
            electricity matters.
          </p>
          <h3 id="d">Other Issues</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to receiving comments relating to the Electricity Cost
            Recovery Concept, stakeholders also provided feedback on other
            matters. One concern is the Board's inability to account for the
            costs of specific activities, and that there is no formal mechanism
            for industry to review the Board's costs. There is also a concern
            about an increase in NEB costs resulting from the implementation of
            a new cost recovery process.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1989, the Board created the Cost Recovery Liaison Committee
            (CRLC) as part of the new cost recovery program. The CRLC is
            comprised of representatives from the oil, gas and electricity
            industries and currently meets three to four times a year. NEB costs
            and budgets, as well as Board performance results, are presented and
            discussed. The CRLC is an available forum for stakeholders to be
            informed and provide input about Board financial matters; the next
            CLRC meeting is scheduled to take place in Calgary on
            9&nbsp;May&nbsp;2006. While there is a defined committee, the
            meetings are open to all industry representatives and participants
            may also attend by conference call. If you wish to receive more
            information about the upcoming meeting, please contact Jeff McGregor
            at 403-473-8098.
          </p>
          <p>
            NEB financial statements are also audited annually by the Auditor
            General and are posted on the NEB website under Publications
            -&nbsp;Auditor's Reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some stakeholders questioned the need for Energy Market Assessments
            (EMAs), suggesting that there are no direct benefits to them from
            this program. In addition, stakeholders would like to be consulted
            prior to the Board conducting such assessments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board's light-handed approach in relation to the regulation of
            electricity is premised on maintaining a current understanding of
            market issues. As part of that, the Board conducts its market
            monitoring program, including EMAs. The subjects of EMAs are
            identified based upon comments received from stakeholders and
            upcoming EMAs are posted on the Board's website. Typically, EMAs are
            developed through extensive consultations with stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the industry indicated that the Board's costs not related
            to applications should only be paid by the beneficiaries (user-pay
            approach).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board does not identify direct beneficiaries given the nature of
            the activities performed by the Board within the mandate set by
            Parliament. It would be difficult to have a user-pay approach that
            would equitably match clients and benefits directly since the Board
            regulates in the Canadian public interest.
          </p>
          <h3 id="e">Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The Board is satisfied with the modified Electricity Cost Recovery
            Concept as the approach taken to establish the proposal was fair and
            transparent. The Board is of the view that the Concept is equitable
            and is now better adapted to the electricity industry as it has
            evolved.

            The National Energy Board (NEB) has developed a web-based Online
            Event Reporting System (OERS) that regulated companies are required
            to use to report events under the various regulations administered
            by the Board. In addition to this system, the attached document
            entitled <em>NEB Event Reporting Guidelines</em> (the Guidelines)
            provides companies with greater clarity regarding the Board’s
            requirements with respect to event reporting under its various
            regulations. With the exception of “significant incidents” (see
            section&nbsp;11 of the Guidelines), OERS replaces the requirement
            for companies to report events relating to NEB-regulated facilities
            to the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) reporting hotline (as
            established by the “Single-Window Reporting Letter” issued by the
            NEB dated 25&nbsp;August&nbsp;1999).
          </p>
          <p>
            The events that are reportable using the online reporting system
            are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              incidents under the
              <em>National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em> (OPR),
              <em>National Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations</em> (PPR),
              and
              <em>Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations</em>
              (DPR)/<em>Oil and Gas Drilling Regulations</em>;
            </li>
            <li>
              unauthorized activities under the

          <p>
            The goal of this document is to provide National Energy Board (NEB,
            the Board) regulated companies with greater clarity regarding the
            Board’s expectations for event reporting (e.g.,&nbsp;incidents,
            occurrences, etc.) under its regulations. This will (a) provide
            companies with the information necessary to clearly understand the
            Board’s expectations with respect to event reporting; and (b)
            require companies to provide the NEB with the information necessary
            for the NEB to conduct the appropriate follow-up.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s2">2.0 Background</h2>
          <p>
            This document sets out the events that are reportable under the
            regulations administered by the Board and provides examples of such
            events. It also explains the Board’s expectations as to the timing
            of reporting and the information required when reporting events.
          </p>
          <p>
            All companies regulated by the NEB under the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA, as it applies to
            the Norman Wells proven area and offshore) are responsible to follow
            the reporting requirements set out in this document. In addition,
            companies that are regulated by the Board under the Northwest
            Territories <em>Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (OGOA) in the
            Inuvialuit Settlement Region are required to report events in
            accordance with these guidelines.<sup
              ><a href="#ftn1back" id="ftn1">[1]</a></sup
            >
            Companies may have additional reporting requirements under other
            legislation such as the <em>Canada Labour Code</em> (CLC) and are
            responsible for reporting to the appropriate government departments
            or agencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) have
            adopted a single window reporting approach.&nbsp; However, in some
            areas, the TSB reporting requirements are somewhat different than
            the NEB requirements. For additional details on the TSB reporting
            requirements, companies should refer to the
            <a
              href="http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/incidents-occurrence/pipeline/index.html"
              rel="external"
              >TSB website</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_2">2.2 Precautionary Approach</h3>
          <p>
            The Board’s top priorities are the safety and security of people,
            and the protection of the environment and property. Accordingly, it
            is the Board’s expectation that each company take a precautionary
            approach to the reporting of events. This means that even if there
            is some doubt as to whether an event should be reported, the company
            must report the event. In other words, companies should adopt a
            “when in doubt, report” approach. This approach to event reporting
            is consistent with NEB-regulated companies’ responsibility for
            anticipating, preventing, mitigating and managing incidents of any
            size or duration.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where an event was reported and subsequent evidence
            indicates that it was not reportable, the NEB records will reflect
            this and the event will not be included on the company’s compliance
            record.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_3">2.3 NEB Oversight of Event Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            In accordance with section&nbsp;12 of the NEB Act, the NEB reviews
            all events that are reported in order to assess whether companies
            have taken the appropriate corrective actions and to identify trends
            that may exist in regard to events. The NEB implements enforcement
            actions where necessary if any non-compliance is identified during
            the course of review.

          <p>
            Section&nbsp;52 of the OPR requires companies to notify the Board of
            all incidents relating to the construction, operation, or
            abandonment of their pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>An “incident” is defined in section&nbsp;1 of the OPR as:</p>
          <p class="mrgn-lft-md ">an occurrence that results in</p>
          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>the death of or serious injury to a person;</li>
            <li>a significant adverse effect on the environment;</li>
            <li>an unintended fire or explosion;</li>
            <li>
              an unintended or uncontained release of low-vapour pressure (LVP)
              hydrocarbons in excess of 1.5&nbsp;m&sup3;;

            <li>
              the operation of a pipeline beyond its design limits as determined
              under CSA&nbsp;Z662 or CSA&nbsp;Z276 or any operating limits
              imposed by the Board.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Paragraphs&nbsp;(<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>) and (<em>f</em>) have
            been identified as requiring additional guidance and are clarified
            below.
          </p>
          <h4 id="s3_1_1">
            3.1.1 “The death of or serious injury to a person”
          </h4>
          <p>
            Companies are required to report a death or serious injury to a
            person only where the death or injury is a result of an occurrence
            that relates to the construction, operation, or abandonment of a
            pipeline<sup><a href="#ftn2back" id="ftn2">[2]</a></sup
            >. Whether a death or injury is related to the construction,
            operation, or abandonment of a pipeline will depend on whether the
            person who was killed or injured was working at the time of the
            incident and/or whether the work was a cause or contributing factor
            to the incident. It is important to note that, unlike the CLC, the
            OPR does not differentiate between different types of “persons”.
            Therefore, companies must report all deaths or serious injuries to
            <em>any person</em> that occur relating to pipeline construction,
            operation, or abandonment regardless of whether that person was
            directly employed by the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where it is unclear whether a death or serious injury relates to the
            construction, operation, or abandonment of a pipeline (e.g.,&nbsp;a
            suspected heart attack), the Board expects that companies will
            employ the precautionary approach and report such deaths. Companies
            will have the opportunity to demonstrate, as part of their detailed
            reports (see section&nbsp;10), that the occurrence that resulted in
            a death or serious injury did not qualify as an incident
            (e.g.,&nbsp;that it resulted from a pre-existing health condition
            unrelated to the work that the person was doing). In these cases,
            the NEB will change the status of the occurrence from reportable
            (i.e.,&nbsp;an incident) to not reportable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The definition of “serious injury” in the OPR is not exhaustive and
            contains multiple injuries that qualify as serious, including “the
            fracture of a major bone”. The NEB uses the following definition of
            “major bone”: skull, mandible, spine, scapula, pelvis, femur,
            humerus, fibula, tibia, radius, and ulna.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible that a single occurrence may result in multiple
            serious injuries (e.g.,&nbsp;an occurrence that results in both the
            loss of sight in one or both eyes, as well unconsciousness).
            Companies must report all serious injuries that qualify as
            incidents, even if all injuries result from a single occurrence. If
            multiple serious injuries or deaths occur as a result of a single
            incident at the same location or if multiple serious injuries occur
            to the same person in a single event, companies are expected to
            report those occurrences under a single incident report. Conversely,
            if multiple serious injuries occur at different locations companies
            are expected to file separate reports for each occurrence. Companies
            should refer to section&nbsp;10 for additional information on
            reporting information requirements.

            <li>
              release of a toxic substance (as defined in the OPR) into a
              sensitive environment (e.g.,&nbsp;watercourse or wetland) or into
              a designated national/provincial area (e.g.,&nbsp;national park,
              provincial park, wildlife refuge);
            </li>
            <li>
              “frac outs” released directly into a watercourse during horizontal
              directional drilling operations;
            </li>
            <li>
              the release of a toxic substance in an area where there is a
              pathway to a receptor nearby (e.g.,&nbsp;the groundwater or
              surface water is used for drinking water, irrigation water, and/or
              is consumed by livestock); and
            </li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Companies are expected to apply the precautionary approach and
            report all occurrences that may result in a significant adverse
            effect on the environment. Companies will have the opportunity to
            demonstrate, as part of their detailed reports (see
            section&nbsp;10), that the occurrence did not have a significant
            adverse effect on the environment. In these cases, the status of the
            occurrence can be changed from reportable (i.e.,&nbsp;an incident)
            to not reportable.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that, if adverse effects are caused by residual
            contamination from a historical event, it should be reported through
            the Secretary of the Board as a Notification of Contamination. This
            process is further described in the NEB

            A “loss of containment” is an event that allows any fluid in the
            well bore to bypass well barriers and reach the surface or
            potentially adversely impact a downhole hydrocarbon-bearing
            reservoir. This includes a formation kick or a blow-out, or lost
            circulation into a hydrocarbon bearing reservoir. It does not
            include lost circulation into a non-hydrocarbon bearing zone below
            the surface casing depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lost circulation of any fluid in the well above the surface casing
            depth may qualify as an incident under this definition if it has
            potential to result in any adverse impact to the environment
            (e.g.,&nbsp;contamination of soil or surface or groundwater).

            support craft”
          </h4>
          <p>
            An imminent threat to safety means that a person, installation, or
            support craft will be harmed in the near future unless the threat
            can be avoided, additional control measures are put in place to

          </ul>
          <h4 id="s6_1_3">6.1.3 “Pollution” and significant pollution</h4>
          <p>
            Subsections&nbsp;1(1) of the DPR and the OGOA DPR define “pollution”
            as the introduction into the natural environment of any substance or
            form of energy outside the limits applicable to the activity that is
            subject to an authorization, including spills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies are expected to report an introduction of substance or
            form of energy as pollution if it exceeds a limit of discharge
            outlined in an environmental protection plan prepared in relation to
            an authorization (sections&nbsp;6 and&nbsp;9 of the DPR and the OGOA
            DRP). In the absence of such a limit, companies must report any
            release of that substance or form of energy into the natural
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subparagraphs&nbsp;75(2)(<em>b</em>)(vi) of the DPR and the OGOA DPR
            address, among other things, reporting requirements for incidents of
            significant pollution. Events that constitute significant pollution
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              spills of hydrocarbons, well or formation fluids outside of
              secondary containment; and
            </li>
            <li>
              discharge of substances that result in an exceedance of relevant
              quality criteria such as Canadian Council for Ministers of the
              Environment Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, if the limit of discharge for natural gas to a flare
            that cannot be feasibly conserved is a gas flow rate of
            100&nbsp;x&nbsp;103&nbsp;m&sup3;/d, a flow rate of
            150&nbsp;x&nbsp;103&nbsp;m&sup3;/d exceeds the discharge limit and
            is pollution. If the discharge also exceeds quality criteria or
            standards, such as the National Ambient Air Quality Objectives or
            the Northwest Territories Ambient Air Quality Standards, it is
            considered to be significant pollution.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_2">6.2 “Near-miss”</h3>
          <p>
            “Near-miss” is defined in subsections&nbsp;1(1) of the DPR and the
            OGOA DPR as an event that would likely cause an event set out in
            paragraph&nbsp;(<em>a</em>) of the definition of “incident”, but
            does not, due to particular circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sections&nbsp;75 of the DPR and the OGOA DPR do not differentiate
            between the information requirements for near-misses and incidents.
            As such, companies must provide equivalent reports for both types of
            events to the Board.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_3">6.3 Reporting Timelines</h3>
          <p>
            Paragraphs 75(1)(<em>a</em>) of the DPR and the OGOA DPR state that
            the operator must ensure that the Board is notified of any incident
            or near-miss “as soon as the circumstances permit”. In this context,
            this phrase is substantively the same as “immediately”; therefore
            the notification period is the same as the notification periods that
            is expected where the term “immediately” appears. Companies should
            refer to section&nbsp;11 of this document for guidance regarding
            timing of this notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paragraphs&nbsp;75(1)(<em>b</em>) of the DPR and the OGOA DPR
            require that the Board be notified at least 24&nbsp;hours in advance
            of any press release or press conference held by the operator
            concerning any incident or near-miss, except in an emergency
            situation, in which case the Board shall be notified without delay
            before the press release or press conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these cases, companies must call the NEB Incident Phone line
            at&nbsp;(403)&nbsp;807-9473 and indicate the subject of the press
            release or conference, the date and time of occurrence, and the
            relevant company personnel’s contact information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to notification, paragraphs&nbsp;75(2)(<em>b</em>) of
            the DPR and the OGOA DPR require companies to submit an
            investigation report identifying the root cause, causal factors, and
            corrective action taken to the Board no later than 21&nbsp;days
            after the day on which the incident or near-miss occurred for the
            following incidents or near-misses:

            Conservation Officer and the Chief Safety Officer immediately, by
            the most rapid and practical means. Notification via the online
            reporting system or through the TSB incident hotline meets the
            requirements of informing the Chief Conservation and Safety
            Officers. Companies should refer to section&nbsp;11 of this document

            >, companies must also consider if the event qualifies as a
            “significant incident”. A significant incident is an acute event
            that results in: term, as prescribed herein.
          </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              a serious injury (as defined in the OPR or TSB regulations);
            </li>
            <li>
              a fire or explosion that causes a pipeline or facility to be

            <li>
              a LVP hydrocarbon release in excess of 1.5&nbsp;m&sup3; that
              leaves company property or the right of way;
            </li>
            <li>a rupture; or</li>
            <li>a toxic plume as defined in CSA&nbsp;Z662.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For the purposes of this document, a “rupture” is an instantaneous
            release that immediately impairs the operation of a pipeline segment
            such that the pressure of the segment cannot be maintained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where an event qualifies as a significant incident and must be
            reported immediately, companies are required to notify the TSB
            Reporting Hotline at (819) 997-7887. Subsequently, the company is
            required to input the details required by both the TSB (see TSB
            regulations) and the NEB for each significant incident into the
            online reporting system. The phone notification and the input of
            information into OERS are required to occur within 3&nbsp;hours of
            the incident being discovered. The goal of the initial phone
            notification is to allow the relevant agencies to mobilize a
            response to an incident, if required.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all other events that must be reported immediately, companies
            must report within twenty-four&nbsp;hours of occurrence or discovery
            to the online reporting system.

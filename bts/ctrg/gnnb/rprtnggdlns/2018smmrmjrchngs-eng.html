                    As framed, section&nbsp;4.1.3 of the proposed updated
                    guidelines would require regulated companies to report any
                    “fugitive emissions” encountered during the regular ongoing
                    operation of pipeline systems. As examples, the Board points
                    to releases through faulty seals, packing, gaskets, and
                    O-rings. Alliance notes that the reporting of such events
                    would significantly increase the reporting obligations
                    relative to current state, with no tangible benefit to
                    public safety. Furthermore, such requirements would likely
                    result in difficulty differentiating between incidents that
                    have attendant safety concerns and those which do not.

                  <p>
                    For the reasons expressed in greater detail below, Alliance
                    would urge the Board to remove fugitive emissions from the
                    proposed updated guidelines:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Absence of Safety Risk &ndash; As acknowledged by the NEB, a
                    fugitive emission release “poses no risk to the safety of
                    the public, company employees or to the immediate
                    environment”. As such, a fugitive emission does not have the
                    character of a hazardous incident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regulatory Reporting Requirement Unchanged &ndash; The
                    sustaining criterion in the NEB Onshore Pipeline Regulations
                    is “an unintended or uncontrolled release of gas or HVP
                    hydrocarbons”. This same basic criterion has been in place
                    for decades, and has never been interpreted or enforced to
                    include fugitive emissions. Alliance submits that no
                    compelling reason has been shown to require an amendment to
                    this past convention.

                  <p>
                    Nature and Origin of Fugitive Emissions &ndash; Pipeline
                    companies strive to minimize fugitive emissions; however,
                    very small-scale release resulting from the regular wear and
                    tear and sometimes imperfect functioning of seals, packing,
                    gaskets, O-rings, and the like are an operational reality.
                    Fugitive emissions are therefore not extraordinary events,
                    but rather an aspect that companies have to appropriately
                    manage on an ongoing basis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prevailing NEB Requirements &ndash; Further to the preceding
                    bullet, fugitive emissions are managed by companies within
                    the context of the operations and maintenance, integrity
                    management, and environmental management programs that are
                    already mandated by the NEB Onshore Pipeline Regulations (at
                    sections&nbsp;27, 40, and 48).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Existing Government Reporting Framework &ndash; Fugitive
                    Emissions are already subject to an extensive reporting
                    framework in Canada. Federally-regulated pipelines have,
                    among others, obligations to report fugitive emissions under
                    the following regulatory regimes: (i)&nbsp;Environment and
                    Climate Change Canada in respect of greenhouse gas (GHG)
                    emissions through the Federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting
                    Program; (ii)&nbsp;the Ontario Ministry of Environment, and
                    Climate Change; (iii)&nbsp;the Quebec Ministry of
                    Sustainable Development, Environment, and the Fight against
                    Climate Change; (iv)&nbsp;Alberta Environment and Parks; and
                    (v)&nbsp;the British Columbia Climate Action Secretariat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Proposed New Federal Regulations &ndash; Additionally,
                    Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Department of
                    Health issued draft regulations on May&nbsp;27, 2017 for the
                    reduction of releases of methane and certain volatile
                    organic compounds from upstream oil and gas facilities and
                    transmission pipeline systems.4 The draft regulations, which
                    would apply to all federally regulated pipelines, pose
                    specific requirements for fugitive emissions within the
                    context of “Leak Detection and Repair”. More particularly,
                    the proposed regulations would require the periodic conduct
                    of leak detection surveys using optical gas imaging, with
                    provision that any leaks ≥ 500 ppm be repaired within
                    certain defined time frames.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In light of the foregoing, Alliance would urge the Board to
                    not classify fugitive emissions as reportable incidents or
                    events. Rather, the Board should continue to allow pipeline
                    companies to manage the fugitive emission aspect within the
                    context of existing and emerging regulatory requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the longer term, Alliance would recommend that the Board
                    work towards developing a volumetric incident reporting
                    threshold for unintended natural gas releases. In this
                    connection, CEPA notes that the Pipeline and Hazardous
                    Materials Safety Administration within the United States
                    Department of Transportation employs a volumetric reporting
                    threshold of three million standard cubic feet or more for
                    unintended natural gas releases.

                    In Alliance’s respectful submission, the Board would be
                    unnecessarily over-extending the reporting requirement in
                    going from third-party strikes to all forms of pipeline
                    damage no matter the severity and no matter how caused.

                    could either amend the “incident” definition in the NEB
                    Onshore Pipeline Regulations or issue a corresponding order
                    using its powers under the National Energy Board Act.

                    pipeline damage aspect is already addressed within the
                    context of a pipeline company’s integrity management

                    pipeline companies. Going forward, these sessions will
                    continue to be an appropriate forum for providing the Board
                    with information on the ongoing integrity of pipeline

                    As framed, Section&nbsp;4.1.3 in the proposed updated
                    guidelines would require regulated companies to report any
                    “fugitive emissions” encountered during the regular ongoing
                    operation of pipeline systems. For example, the NEB points
                    to releases through faulty seals, packing, gaskets, and
                    O-rings. This approach to reporting fugitive emissions
                    assumes that fugitive emissions are incidents that are
                    detectable in real time (within 24&nbsp;hours). In reality
                    most fugitive emissions are very small and are only
                    detectable when specific testing is conducted. Furthermore,
                    failing to make a distinction between normal operations and
                    safety events is an impediment to measuring and reporting
                    pipeline safety performance, and will likely be confusing
                    and potentially misleading to the Canadian public.

                    The NEB considered these comments globally and is responding
                    in that manner. The NEB expects companies to minimize their
                    operational emissions in general and has found that there
                    has been inconsistent reporting between regulated companies

                    With reference to Sections&nbsp;6.2 and 11.7 of the proposed
                    updated guidelines, it is CEPA’s understanding that the NEB
                    is looking to take the “pipeline damage” reporting feature
                    from the Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations and expand
                    that reporting requirement to all forms of damage, no matter
                    what the cause or severity (e.g. “coating scratch”). CEPA is
                    of the view that not all damage is necessarily an “incident”
                    and that further criteria and guidance are required. For
                    example, a “coating scratch” could be revised to read
                    “coating damage that is indicative of line contact with
                    potential to impact the integrity of the pipeline”.

                  <p>
                    CEPA also notes integrity metrics are incorporated in the
                    pipeline performance measures that pipeline companies are
                    required to submit to the NEB each spring. If an occurrence
                    of pipeline damage results in a loss of containment or other
                    significant consequence, it is captured as a reportable
                    event under the various incident reporting criteria set out
                    in section&nbsp;1 of the OPR. Additionally, for many years,
                    the NEB has conducted annual pipeline integrity information
                    exchange sessions with individual Group 1 pipeline
                    companies. Going forward, these will continue to be the
                    appropriate forums for providing the NEB with information on
                    the ongoing integrity of pipeline systems (including the
                    identification and remediation of any pipeline defects or
                    damage).

                    CEPA would like to better understand the value and objective
                    of collecting incident cost information. In addition,
                    further information on the types of costs (initial response
                    or ongoing remediation) and timeframe for reporting is

                    Based on the initial review of the proposed changes, CEPA’s
                    view is that reporting incident costs does not add value to
                    the effectiveness of incident reporting. Reporting costs
                    associated with an incident will vary widely due to
                    individual company processes and procedures. For example,
                    companies may have different methods for tracking costs; one
                    company may hire a contractor to respond &ndash; an Oil
                    Spill Removal Organization like relationship &ndash; that
                    will be costly, while other companies have an internal
                    capability that would be less costly.

                    The definition of “incident” in the OPR clearly sets out
                    what is reportable to the Board; occurrences that result in
                    operation of the pipeline beyond its design limits as
                    determined under CSA&nbsp;Z662 or any operating limits
                    imposed by the Board. The precise criterion appearing in the
                    “incident” definition in Section&nbsp;1 of the Regulations
                    is as follows: “the operation of a pipeline beyond its
                    design limits as determined under CSA&nbsp;Z662 or
                    CSA&nbsp;Z276 or any operating limits imposed by the Board”.
                    The draft revised Guidelines provide examples of reportable
                    incidents that fall into the category of “operations beyond
                    design limits” that are inaccurate or do not have a design
                    limit within CSA&nbsp;Z662 or CSA&nbsp;Z276. Specific

                    Slope movement &ndash; When designing a pipeline, many
                    companies will account for slope movements and ensure such
                    movements are within the limits of that design. In other
                    words, a slope movement does not necessarily mean that there
                    is an “operating beyond design limits” incident.
                    Furthermore, a pipeline company will often monitor select
                    slopes on a long-term basis in conjunction with their
                    integrity management programs. In such cases, there would be
                    very slow ground movement (&lt; 1 mm/day with somewhat
                    higher rates encountered during heavy rains).

                    limits of the pipeline as determined under CSA&nbsp;Z662 or

                    standards / requirements. Some tariff limits are driven by
                    commercial negotiations and therefore not design limits and
                    should therefore be excluded from reporting. Furthermore,
                    some qualities in tariff specifications have no impact on
                    the ability to maintain safe and reliable pipeline
                    operations. For example, certain properties are monitored as
                    a courtesy to end-use customers. Exceeding a tariff limit
                    would not necessarily be an example of operating beyond
                    design limits...

                    restrictions would have a dampening effect on imposing those

                    self-impose pressure restrictions for precautionary reasons
                    on a temporary basis pending in-line inspections or other

                    The NEB has considered CEPA's feedback and does not agree
                    with the arguments made. If a pipeline is under a
                    self-imposed pressure restriction on a precautionary basis
                    pending verification activities for safety reasons, any
                    exceedance of this pressure may lead to an integrity or
                    safety risk and the Board needs to be made aware of this. In
                    addition, NEB staff find it difficult to believe that a
                    company would ignore potential safety concerns by changing
                    their approach to applying pressure restrictions from a
                    precautionary standpoint due to a reporting requirement.

                    the uninterruptible power system (UPS) or the back-up

                    The NEB considered Enbridge's feedback and agree that an arc
                    is not in itself considered a fire or an explosion but
                    rather the potential source of fire or explosion. In the
                    event that an arc causes a fire or an explosion, this event
                    becomes reportable. For the bullet under &quot;Events that

                    Enbridge would like further clarity from the Board regarding
                    criteria for when pipeline damage is considered material and
                    should be reported as an incident. In regard to coating
                    damage, reporting all “coating scratches” would be
                    problematic. For example, during pipe exposure for integrity
                    digs there could be some scratches caused to the coating
                    that would not be indicative of any pipe damage or previous
                    line contact. The Alberta Pipeline Rules recognizes this in
                    its definition of “contact damage” and
                    subclause&nbsp;1(1)(e)(iii) includes, “damage to the
                    pipeline’s protective coating that compromises the
                    functionality of the coating, with the exception of minor
                    damages that may occur during final hand excavation and
                    external cleaning”. Enbridge suggests that the example of a
                    “coating scratch” be revised assuggested by CEPA or be
                    aligned with the criteria in the Pipeline Rules.

                    small fire during welding can occur, if there is no impact
                    to the construction, operation or abandonment of pipeline

                    reported would likely result in loss of containment, damage
                    to infrastructure, casualties, impact to environment, etc.
                    In defining reportable fires / explosions the NEB should
                    consider the following:

                  <p>
                    Does the fire impact on any operations during the lifecycle
                    of the pipeline?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Does the fire impact on materials used in the operations
                    during the lifecycle of the pipeline?
                  </p>
                  <p>Does the fire impact on environment?</p>
                  <p>Does the fire impact on public safety?</p>
                  <p>
                    Has the fire resulted in casualties or need for emergency
                    response?

                    There are limited regulations on fugitive emissions programs
                    and until legislation is in place that will drive such a
                    requirement, there is little likelihood that fugitive type
                    emissions will be identified and reported at that level.

                    The proposal in Section&nbsp;4.1.4 of the Proposed Revised
                    Guidelines to report &quot;any exceedance of product,
                    chemical properties as defined in the tariff limits&quot;
                    should be amended to require only reporting ofexceedances
                    that pose an integrity risk as determined by the operator
                    according to applicable codes. Many tariff exceedances have
                    no material impact on integrity. The current structure of
                    the proposed Revised Guidelines is to require each
                    exceedance to be assessed by an Engineering Assessment (EA),
                    imposing a substantial administrative cost to both industry
                    and the regulator with little or no benefit to safety or the
                    environment. The approach in the Proposed Revised Guidelines
                    appears to assume a tariff exceedance necessarily results in
                    a potential integrity threat, and consequently ought to
                    drive an EA. This is not the case. A tariff exceedance
                    rarely results in integrity concerns. Tariff gas and oil
                    quality specifications are selected for a combination of
                    factors, including commercial considerations, and not purely
                    on the basis of whether or not an exceedance may pose a risk
                    to integrity. The combination of factors and their relative
                    weight may vary by company.

                    TransCanada recommends that the NEB keep in place the
                    current reporting timelines: a phone notification as soon as
                    possible, not to exceed 3&nbsp;hours, and input of
                    information into OERS within 24&nbsp;hours of the incident.

                    Regardless of how the Proposed Revised Guidelines change, a
                    successful transition to a new reporting regime must include
                    a transition period, define the contents of an acceptable
                    implementation plan and change management process for
                    affected entities, and provide reasonable time frames for
                    affected entities to adjust internal processes. This
                    transition period would also allow industry to
                    implementtraining on the new requirements before they go
                    into effect. Finally, where new types of incidents are now
                    required to be reported, reporting should only be required
                    for those incidents discovered after the completion date of
                    the implementation plan and change management process.

                    Although the term &quot;design limits&quot; is not
                    specifically defined in the OPR or CSA&nbsp;Z662, CEPA
                    understands that the intent is specific to reporting
                    incidents where it is confirmed that the pipeline's
                    structural design limit has been exceeded. CEPA suggests
                    that this is more appropriate than reporting exceedances of
                    parameters that, only by inference, may or may not have a
                    possibility to affect a pipeline's structural design limit.
                    Exceeding such parameters without affecting a pipeline's
                    structural design limit may meet the definition of a near
                    miss, however, it would not meet that of an incident. For
                    example:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1) Pipe exposure:</strong> On its own, pipe exposure
                    does not necessarily equate to exceeding design limits. The
                    design limits in the context of safety and integrity are
                    those based on pipeline structural integrity. Many other
                    requirements within the CSA standards are recommendations
                    and good practices, and should not be considered as design
                    limits. CEPA interpret's the NEB's view is that if a
                    pipeline is designed to operate while buried, the operation
                    of the same pipeline uncovered is operation beyond design
                    limits. CEPA suggests that the key technical concept is
                    whether the physical context in which the pipeline operates
                    has changed such that the pipe is subject to stress or other
                    physical impairment resulting in unsafe operations
                    (i.e.&nbsp;operating beyond design limit). A pipeline
                    designed to operate which covered may also safely operate
                    uncovered. In the same way that not all slope movement will
                    result in operation beyond design limits, not all loss of
                    cover will result in operation beyond design limits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>2) Self-imposed pressure restrictions:</strong>
                    Requiring companies to report excursions of self-imposed
                    pressure restrictions would have a dampening effect on
                    imposing those pressure restrictions in the first place.
                    Companies often self-impose pressure restrictions for
                    precautionary reasons on a temporary basis pending in-line
                    inspections or other verification activities. The Board has
                    the power to test the adequacy and effectiveness of a
                    company's controls through inspections, audits or other
                    available compliance verification mechanisms.

                    The NEB does not agree with the rationale in CEPA’s
                    position. The NEB is of the view that when a company
                    operates beyond its design limits it is a strong indicator
                    that the company does not have the appropriate operational
                    controls in place to prevent these events from happening.
                    The lack of or inadequate operational controls may have a
                    direct impact on safety and the reporting of these events
                    may lead to opportunities to prevent more serious incidents
                    form occurring. As such staff have proposed a conservative
                    definition in alignment with the precautionary approach;
                    staff purposely intend on capturing occurrences where it is
                    unclear that an “integrity concern” was caused.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is important to note that the Onshore Pipelines
                    Regulations does not provide any definition or even an
                    opportunity to define the term “near miss” as referenced by
                    CEPA. Indeed, OBDL incidents in general could all be
                    considered near misses in general terms; however, they are
                    defined as incidents in the OPR and therefore the term “near
                    miss” is not relevant to the current conversation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CEPA presents details on two possible cases. The NEB has
                    provided a respose to the two specific cases outlined by
                    CEPA:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1. Pipeline exposure. Cover affords the pipe some measure of
                    protection. Unless the company can point to where exposure
                    of the pipeline was specifically addressed in the Design
                    Base Memorandum and how it was incorporated in its design
                    and construction, a cover less than design cover is
                    operating beyond design limits. In short, a pipeline that
                    was designed to be buried should remain buried.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. Self-imposed pressure restrictions. The NEB does not
                    believe that companies would stop applying precautionary
                    pressure restrictions due to a reporting requirement. This
                    would not be a responsible action to take and would
                    precipitate a reaction from NEB if found during the course
                    of a compliance activity. While the Board does have the
                    power to test the adequacy/effectiveness of company
                    controls, the argument is moot as it intends to use this
                    data to help inform those activities and as such it serves
                    only to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its
                    powers.

                    categorized as examples of operating beyond design limits:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1) When a slope's movement exceeds what was predicted at the
                    design stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2) If an unstable slope is discovered in Operation that was
                    not identified during the design stage.

                    including incident costs does not add value to the
                    effectiveness of incident reporting and does not add value
                    to the transparency interests of Canadians. Reporting costs
                    associated with an incident will vary widely due to
                    individual company processes and procedures. For example,
                    companies may have different methods of tracking costs. A
                    company that hires a contractor to respond to an incident
                    will have a different cost structure and resulting costs
                    compared to a company that relies on internal response
                    capabilities. Further to this point, a company may choose to
                    pay for differing levels of contingency or back up
                    resources. These could all be appropriate solutions for
                    responding to an incident, but result in very different
                    costs for similar event types and outcomes .

                    CEPA recommends the revised Event Reporting Guidelines not
                    include incident cost requirements. If the NEB does require
                    such information there needs to be clarity on the purpose of
                    collecting the information as well as its intended use. This
                    information should be collected through other more
                    appropriate channels on a case-by-case basis.

                    The NEB has considered CEPA's comments and does not agree.
                    As outlined in the meeting held with CEPA on September 29,
                    2017 the NEB requires this information because:

                    &ndash; On 19&nbsp;June 2016, the Pipeline Safety Act
                    (Bill&nbsp;C-46) came into force and amended the National
                    Energy Board Act to, among other things, impose additional
                    financial requirements on companies. The NEB will begin
                    collecting incident cost information from companies in order
                    to have a more adequate data set to inform the assessment of
                    companies’ financial resources plans, as well as the
                    circumstances which would warrant financial resource amounts
                    that are greater than the absolute limit of liability that
                    applies to them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &ndash; Bill&nbsp;C-46 also provided the NEB with the
                    additional authority to order a company to reimburse others
                    that have incurred costs or expenses in relation to a
                    pipeline release. A sound understanding of costs will be
                    required in order to assess applications from third parties
                    of this nature.

                  <p>
                    &ndash; Commencing with the 2017-2018 fiscal year, the Board
                    will use “collection of information regarding the monetary
                    impact of spills” as an indicator that companies are
                    cleaning up spills in an efficient and effective manner, as
                    part of its reporting to Parliamentarians (through our
                    Departmental Results Framework). This new performance
                    indicator may, in and of itself, raise public interest in
                    spill costs.

                  <p>
                    The NEB agrees that incident costs vary. However the NEB is
                    not persuaded that this is a reason not to collect the data,
                    rather it informs the appropriate approach to analysing the
                    data. In addition, given the other details reported in the
                    OERS including details on location and magnitude (e.g.
                    amount of product released), incident costs would not be
                    completely without context as CEPA implies. While additional
                    context may be needed at some point, the NEB maintains that
                    the total costs of an incident still provide a rough
                    indication of the level of effort required to correct the
                    consequences caused by the incident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OERS is the system of record of incident data and, because
                    the costs of an incident are intrinsically linked to that
                    incident, it is the most appropriate place to collect the
                    data. Given that the NEB estimates an average of
                    3&nbsp;incidents per year will require reporting of costs
                    the creation of a &quot;more appropriate&quot; channel to
                    report costs is unncessessary. Note that changes will be
                    made to OERS to accomodate the longer timelines associated
                    with incident costs.

                    The NEB disagrees that only sustained fires should be
                    reported and that small welding or housekeeping fires should
                    be specifically excluded. Safety staff consider small fires
                    in aggregate to be a potential soft signal indicating a
                    problem with fire prevention procedures or equipment. Adding
                    “sustained” to the requirements would, in staff's view,
                    result in fires be largely underreported.

                    As currently framed, Section&nbsp;4.1.3 in the proposed
                    updated guidelines would require regulated companies to
                    report &quot; releases due to venting or activation of
                    pressure relief systems that are greater than a total volume
                    of 30,000 standard cubic metres&quot; regardless of whether
                    the release is &quot;unintended or uncontrolled&quot; or a
                    part of operation as the original design intended. CEPA
                    interprets the NEB's approach to reporting to assume a
                    release of fugitive emissions over the threshold is
                    considered an incident regardless of whether it poses a risk
                    to the public or the environment. CEPA believes the release
                    threshold of 30,000 standard cubic metres should be limited
                    only to those releases that are unintended or uncontrolled.
                    Efforts to collect data on fugitive emissions or reduce
                    fugitive emissions should be dealt with through existing
                    measures and agencies.

                    The NEB agree with CEPA's rationale. A release that occurs
                    due to planned venting or activation of pressure relief
                    systems is arguably both intended and controlled and
                    therefore does not logically constitute an incident. As such
                    the NEB proposes to remove the wording from the document
                    entirely. Regardless, companies still must meet the fugitive
                    emissions reporting requirements outlined by Environment and
                    Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The data reported to ECCC is

                    CEPA suggests that some sections of the document still
                    require further clarification to ensure all events that meet
                    the precautionary reporting principle are aligned. This is
                    particularly important with respect to proposed reporting
                    requirements regarding potential leaks. For example, when
                    dead vegetation is spotted along a right-of-way an
                    assessment is completed to determine the cause as there
                    could be many causes other than pipeline leaks. If, during
                    the initial assessment, professional judgment by the
                    pipeline operator determines, based on the balance of
                    information available, that it is a pipeline leak, then
                    taking a precautionary approach to reporting should be
                    considered. Timing for that initial analysis should be a
                    factor as well; if it can be done quickly (which may take
                    several days) then a precautionary report may not be
                    appropriate. However, if there are limitations that drive
                    more time for the initial assessment (e.g. seasonal access)
                    then a precautionary report may be appropriate.

                    The NEB has reviewed all sections of the Revised Guidelines
                    to ensure they are aligned with respect to precautionary
                    reporting. The NEB agrees that judgement plays an important
                    role in determining whether to report something from a
                    precautionary standpoint. There is nothing currently in the
                    language of the Revised Guidelines that suggests otherwise.

                    report. These are specifically the cases that the NEB is

                    Once the guidelines are finalized, CEPA recommends a
                    six-month transition period for implementing new reporting
                    requirements in order to ensure adequate time for regulated
                    companies to educate staff and revise processes.

                    The NEB agrees that the consultation has been productive and
                    there remains areas where CEPA and the NEB are not in
                    agreement. There have been no “fatal flaws” identified to
                    date and therefore no reason to believe one would be
                    identified at this stage. As such the NEB did not perform a
                    final review with CEPA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The NEB does not believe a six month transition period for
                    implementing new reporting requirements is appropriate. The
                    changes are clarifications to existing reporting
                    requirements that are already in effect. In addition, CEPA
                    and its member companies first saw the Revised Guidelines in
                    June 2017 and NEB staff has been transparent in their
                    responses to the initial feedback and the direction the
                    Revised Guidelines were heading. Therefore regulated
                    companies have had four months to consider how they might
                    implement changes should they come into effect. Instead the
                    NEB has provided a transition period with the Revised
                    Guidelines coming to effect April&nbsp;1, 2018.

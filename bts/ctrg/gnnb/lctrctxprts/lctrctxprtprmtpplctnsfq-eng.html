            When applicants seek National Energy Board (the NEB or the Board)
            approval to export electricity, they must apply in writing<sup
              >[1]</sup
            >
            to the Secretary of the Board and must give notice of their
            application to the public. Giving notice is accomplished through
            publishing an advertisement called a Notice of Application and
            Directions on Procedure (an NOA/DOP) and, depending on the
            circumstances, may include additional publication and direct service
            on utilities.

            [1] An application for an electricity export permit is considered in
            a written process.
          </p>
          <p><strong>1. What is an NOA/DOP and what is its purpose?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Giving notice is a basic legal requirement. Any member of the
            public, including a company, who might be affected by a government
            decision, must have access to enough information about the
            application, and the process to consider the application, in order
            to participate effectively. An NOA/DOP is an advertisement in a
            standard format that is required to be published when applying for
            an electricity export permit. An applicant publishing an NOA/DOP, in
            both English and French, gives notice that an application for an
            electricity export permit has been submitted to the Secretary of the
            Board and is ready for review. The applicant outlines how the
            general public, including potentially affected parties, may
            participate in the review process.
          </p>

              them?</strong

          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of electricity export permit applications, it is the
            responsibility of the applicant to complete all publication and
            notice requirements. The level of notice that an applicant is
            required to give will vary depending on different factors.
            Bilingual<sup>[5]</sup> publication of an NOA/DOP in the
            <a
              href="http://www.gazette.gc.ca/accueil-home-eng.html"
              rel="external"
              ><em>Canada Gazette</em></a
            >, Part&nbsp;I<sup>[6]</sup> is required for all applicants as well
            as in such other publications as the Board considers
            appropriate.<sup>[7]</sup> In addition, an electricity export permit
            applicant<sup>[8]</sup> is required to identify to the Board, in the
            application or in the NOA/DOP, whether the applicant or an affiliate
            has interests in generation or transmission facilities in Canada. If
            it does, it has the additional requirement of serving the NOA/DOP on
            utilities in the language of the utilities' choice as well as
            publishing in newspapers, both in English and in French.
          </p>
          <p class="small  ">
            [5] Since Canada is a bilingual country, all notices relating to an
            application to the Board must be published in both French and
            English. The responsibility is always on the applicant to ensure
            that correct notices are published to reach both official language
            groups.<br />
            [6] The official newspaper of the Government of Canada.<br />
            [7] Subsection&nbsp;119.04 (1) of the NEB Act.<br />
            [8] This requirement does not apply to applications for border
            accommodations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, proof of public notice (evidence of publication and service
            on utilities), is required to be submitted to the NEB before the
            notice requirements can be considered complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The requirement to provide notice (as outlined in the NEB Act, the
            Electricity Regulations and the MOG) means that an applicant can
            carry out a specific procedure after considering whether this
            methodology satisfies the intent or purpose of notice. The applicant
            will be expected to demonstrate that it considered the facts and
            determined that the notice completed gave the maximum exposure of
            the application to members of the public that could be affected.

              >4. How does an applicant decide on which utilities to serve
              notice?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the applicant or an affiliate has an interest in facilities,
            the applicant has the additional requirement of serving utilities
            with the notice. In this case, two types of service requirements on
            utilities exist. First, the applicant must serve notice on any
            utilities, including those in neighbouring provinces, which are
            directly interconnected with any facility-related interests of the
            applicant. Second, the applicant must serve notice on those
            transmission utilities in Canadian service areas<sup>[9]</sup> from
            which exports to the United States are proposed.
          </p>
          <p class="small  ">
            [9] In the electricity industry, the term service area generally
            refers to the geographical area in which a transmission or
            distribution company has clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >5. How does an applicant decide in which newspapers to publish
              notice?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the applicant or an affiliate has an interest in facilities,
            the applicant must publish in newspapers both in English and in
            French. The MOG identifies that the NOA/DOP should be advertised in
            the largest paid general circulation newspapers (in English in the
            English newspapers and in French in the French newspapers) in the
            service area(s) from which the proposed exports may originate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, for example, an applicant has an interest in facilities and is
            applying for a blanket permit<sup>[10]</sup> proposing to export
            from the province of Ontario only, then the most populous community
            in the province of Ontario would be Toronto. The applicant would
            then identify the English language newspaper in the Toronto area
            that has the most paid subscriptions. The same process would then
            apply in identifying which French newspaper has the most paid
            subscriptions. However if, for example, an applicant has an interest
            in facilities and is applying for a blanket export permit from all
            provinces in Canada, then publishing in each province is a
            possibility, however, a national newspaper is also an option (see
            Q#7 with respect to multiple service areas).
          </p>
          <p class="small  ">
            [10] Blanket export applications are applications whereby applicants
            request an electricity export permit without having any
            pre-negotiated export sales arrangements or contracts in place.

            <strong
              >6. What if an applicant cannot find both English and French paid
              general circulation newspapers in the service area from which
              exports are proposed?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The MOG specifies that if a community does <em>not</em> have both
            English and French newspapers (at least one of each), that meet the
            definition as outlined, then the NOA/DOP can be published in both
            official languages in the newspaper which has the largest paid
            circulation in that community. At the time of publication of these
            FAQs, every province has at least one English and French paid
            general circulation newspaper.

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The MOG states that where exports are proposed from more than one
            service area, publication may be made in both official languages in
            a nationally published newspaper.
          </p>

              appropriate?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicants can rely on the standard procedure identified in the MOG
            most of the time; however, as the details of every electricity
            export permit application will be different, applicants must keep in
            mind that the intent is to provide notice of the electricity export
            application to potentially affected parties. In determining adequacy
            of notice, Board review will likely focus on whether the intent of
            the MOG and the concept of notice have been met. That is, everyone
            who may be affected has a fair chance to learn about the application
            in sufficient detail that he or she can comment on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            While publishing in newspapers as outlined in the MOG will meet the
            needs for many applications, there may be situations where other
            forms of notice will be more effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, in areas where other languages are spoken and/or an
            oral tradition is still prevalent, broadcast media such as radio or
            television may be more appropriate. In other areas, a newspaper
            published in one or several First Nation languages, instead of in
            English or French, may better serve the population. A third example
            may be sending an email to existing email distribution lists or
            posting to websites. Proof of publication or service using these
            alternative means may need to be provided through an affidavit to
            the Board.<sup>[11]</sup>

          <p>
            Supplementing the notice method described by the MOG would not need
            the permission of the Board. However, varying from this method would
            require permission (see Q#10 regarding variance).

          </p>
          <p>
            The only exemption from <em>Canada Gazette</em> publication is where
            specific terrorist activity has resulted in a critical shortage of
            electricity outside of Canada.<sup>[12]</sup>
          </p>
          <p class="small  ">
            [12] Subsection&nbsp;119.04 (2) of the NEB Act states that the
            &quot;Board may waive the requirement to publish a notice referred
            to in subsection&nbsp;(1) if the Board considers that there is a
            critical shortage of electricity outside Canada caused by terrorist
            activity within the meaning of subsection&nbsp;83.01(1) of the
            <em>Criminal Code</em>.&quot;

          <p>
            Any request for a variation from publication and service
            requirements, including the rationale, must be submitted in writing
            to the Secretary of the Board prior to filing the application. In
            addition, a proposed alternative for informing potentially affected
            interested parties must be included. Any variance to the standard
            procedure for publication and service requirements identified in the
            MOG must be approved by the Board prior to implementation.

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The MOG indicates applicants should publish the NOA/DOP in
            newspapers on the same date (insofar as it is possible to do so) as
            publication occurs in the <em>Canada Gazette</em>, Part&nbsp;I. It
            is recommended that applicants serve the utilities simultaneously by
            publishing in newspapers to keep notice periods concurrent.
          </p>
          <p><strong>12. What length of notice period is required?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Unless the NOA/DOP stipulates a longer period, the processing
            procedure as outlined in the MOG specifies that the Board will wait
            for a 30-day period from the date of publication of the NOA/DOP to
            allow for comments by interested parties. A 30-day notice period is
            included in both the sample NOA/DOP in the MOG appendix as well as
            the electronic template located on the
            <a href="/pplctnflng/sbmt/ssdl/xprtmprtpplctn-eng.html"
              >Online Application System</a
            >
            (OAS).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is aware that frequency of publication of newspapers may
            vary. The <em>Canada Gazette</em>, Part&nbsp;I is published weekly,
            on Saturdays. While most national newspapers and newspapers in
            larger Canadian cities are published daily, many of the smaller
            local and second language newspapers may publish less frequently.
          </p>
          <p>
            To keep notice periods concurrent, notice periods in the various
            publications may each start on different dates but all end on the
            same date, with a minimum of 30&nbsp;days for the shortest one.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the Board is aware that due to a host of reasons (for
            example, business reasons or the complexity of an application),
            applicants may choose to specify NOA/DOP notice periods for
            interested parties that extend beyond&nbsp;30&nbsp;days, such as 45
            or 60&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lengths of notice periods and applicant rights to reply should
            generally be the same for service on utilities as for the published
            NOA/DOP.
          </p>
          <p><strong>13. What constitutes proof of publication?</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Electricity Regulations require proof of publication of the
            notice.<sup>[13]</sup>
          </p>
          <p class="small  ">
            [13] The Electricity Regulations paragraph&nbsp;8&nbsp;<em>c</em>),
            for border accommodations, and paragraph&nbsp;9&nbsp;<em>d</em>),
            for other than border accommodations (either blanket or contract
            specific applications).
          </p>
          <p>
            Proof of publication in the <em>Canada Gazette</em>, Part&nbsp;I, is
            usually provided in the form of either (1)&nbsp;an affidavit from
            the <em>Canada Gazette</em> (upon request of the applicant)
            accompanied by a copy of the advertisement as it was published or
            (2)&nbsp;a published original of the issue in question.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MOG states that applicants are required to file with the Board,
            as soon as possible after the date of publication in the newspapers,
            copies of each newspaper tear sheet showing the published NOA/DOP.
            Proof of publication in newspapers is usually provided through
            submitting the complete page of each newspaper in which the original
            advertisement was published. (See Q#16 for further discussion of
            tear sheets.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>14. What constitutes proof of service on utilities?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicants typically file copies of letters to utilities with the
            Board as evidence of serving notice (clearly indicating the date of
            the letter, the addressee and full street address and references to
            both the application and the NOA/DOP). A cover letter is often
            included with this submission confirming the date(s) the letters
            were sent.
          </p>
          <p><strong>15. How are proofs submitted?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Applicants can demonstrate adequate notice has been provided by
            submitting clear confirmation of each publication and service.
            Proofs of publication and service on utilities are generally
            submitted to the electronic
            <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Home/Index"

            delivery to complete the filing.

              >16. What is a tear sheet, and is an original necessary?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            A tear sheet is a whole newspaper page, torn out of an original
            document after publication, to provide evidence that an
            advertisement was actually published. Pre-prints provided in
            anticipation of publication are not acceptable as they only show
            what is intended and cannot account for errors and omissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paid publications are required to provide a tear sheet upon the
            request of the advertiser. Upon publication in the
            <em>Canada Gazette</em>, Part&nbsp;I, applicants have the option of
            requesting an affidavit of publication, which is accepted as
            evidence that a notice was published.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although original documents are generally required, and are
            typically sent by mail, courier, or hand delivery, virtual or
            electronic tear sheets in Adobe (.pdf) format are acceptable for
            submission through the Board's electronic Regulatory Document Index,
            followed by a printed hard-copy filing by mail, courier or
            hand-delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as with any other document, for alternatives to an original
            tear sheet to be acceptable, whether virtual or scanned, a copy must
            be both clear and readable. In addition, the copy must include the
            standard identifiers that are usually included in the header and/or
            footer of the respective publication. Identifiers usually include
            the title or name of the publication, the publication date, the
            section number (and or section name, type or designation) and the
            page number. The information must be sufficient for any interested
            party accessing the NEB electronic Regulatory Document Index to
            reasonably crosscheck or verify the publication information.

          <p>
            Several examples of NOA/DOPs that would be appropriate for a variety
            of electricity export applications have been included in
            Appendix&nbsp;I of the MOG<sup>[14]</sup>.

            Should an applicant wish to apply for a blanket electricity export
            permit, the NEB's Online Application System (OAS) contains links to
            electronic application forms, in both French and English.

          </p>
          <p>
            No, the applicant is responsible for drafting, translating,
            publishing and sending out all English and French notices as
            applicable.

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            During the pre-application stage, the Board offers applicants the
            opportunity to send draft NOA/DOP advertisements to NEB staff for
            evaluation. At that point, staff will endeavour to provide
            assistance to ensure that the notices comply with the basic notice
            requirements. Note: NEB staff gives feedback only on the limited
            information provided to them by the applicant. Board Members make
            the ultimate determination as to whether whatever notice has been
            given is considered effective. Once an application has been filed,
            no feedback other than decisions of the Board can be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >20. What happens when an interested party believes notice has not
              been effective?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Interested parties should submit a complaint in writing to the
            Secretary of the Board as soon as possible, with a copy to the
            applicant. Such communication should clearly indicate: why the
            public notice was not effective and what action, if any, the
            interested party is requesting of the Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Secretary of the Board receives a complaint while the export
            application is still before the Board, Board Members will consider
            the evidence and determine whether notice was adequate. If public
            notice is found not to have been effective, the Board may direct the
            applicant to republish or serve notice accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if the Secretary of the Board receives a complaint after a
            permit has been issued then the complaint would be considered under

            or order made by it).

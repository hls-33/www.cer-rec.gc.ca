                On 19&nbsp;June 2016, the Pipeline Safety Act came into force.
                Among other changes, the Pipeline Safety Act amended the

              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  introducing absolute liability to pipeline companies, and
                  setting out for pipeline companies with the capacity to
                  transport greater than 250,000&nbsp;barrels of oil per day
                  (major oil pipeline companies), the absolute liability level

                </li>
                <li>
                  requiring pipeline companies to demonstrate to the Board that
                  they meet their requirement to maintain financial resources;
                  and,
                </li>
                <li>

                In February 2018, the Government introduced Bill&nbsp;C-69, An
                Act to Enact the Impact Assessment Act and the Canadian Energy
                Regulator Act, to amend the Navigation Protection Act and to
                make consequential amendments to other Acts. Bill&nbsp;C-69
                proposes to repeal the National Energy Board Act and replace it
                with the Canadian Energy Regulator Act. The above referenced
                changes are included in the Canadian Energy Regulator Act and
                will apply if and when the Canadian Energy Regulator Act comes
                into force.

                Upon release of the Regulations on 11&nbsp;July 2018, the Board
                developed the Draft Pipeline Financial Requirements Guidelines
                (Draft Guidelines) to provide further details on the information
                that each pipeline company should provide to demonstrate that it
                meets the financial resource requirements established in the NEB
                Act and the Regulations.

                On 15&nbsp;February 2019, the Board issued the Draft Guidelines
                and set out a process to gather feedback and comments. All
                companies and interested persons were to submit the comments by
                8&nbsp;March 2019. The Board stated that after receipt of
                comments on the Draft Guidelines, it intended to issue final
                guidelines by 29&nbsp;March 2019, and post the written comments
                on the Board’s website.

                Some commenters made requests, such as for the Board to grant an
                exemption from the NEB Act or Regulations, or for the Board to
                modify Absolute Liability limits or introduce new Absolute
                Liability limit classes. These comments have not been addressed
                in the Final Guidelines, as the NEB Act and Regulations do not
                provide any authority to the Board to grant such requests. In
                addition, the Board finds that comments which pertain to the
                content of the Regulations or NEB Act are outside the scope of
                the Final Guidelines.
              </p>

              <p>
                In its 15&nbsp;February 2019 letter, the Board directed
                companies to file an assessment of their Absolute Liability
                limits, along with supporting information, by 8&nbsp;March 2019.
                All companies who have not yet done so must now submit a
                Financial Resources Plan, pursuant to subsection&nbsp;48.13(3)
                of the NEB Act, detailing the financial resources available to
                respond to a release. Companies should consult section&nbsp;4 of
                the Final Guidelines for details on what the Board expects a
                Financial Resources Plan to include.
              </p>
              <p>
                For expediency and efficiency in assessing the Financial
                Resources Plans, and to enable the Board to assess as many
                Financial Resources Plans as practicable prior to the
                coming-into-force date of the Regulations on 11&nbsp;July 2019,
                the Board requires companies to submit their Financial Resources
                Plans according to the following schedule:

                              The Risk Value for a gas pipeline company is
                              calculated by multiplying the square&nbsp;of the

                1.2 Purpose of the Pipeline Financial Requirements Guidelines
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Pipeline Financial Requirements Guidelines (Guidelines)
                provide further details on how a pipeline company should
                demonstrate that it meets the financial resource requirements
                established in the NEB Act and the Regulations. Each company’s
                information will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. These
                Guidelines may be amended from time to time by the NEB as
                necessary. The Guidelines do not restate all of the particular
                requirements of the NEB Act or Regulations and each company is
                responsible for ensuring familiarity and compliance with the
                statutory requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Guidelines apply in a manner that is supplementary to the
                requirements of the NEB Act and the Regulations. In the event of
                any inconsistency or discrepancy between the Guidelines and the
                NEB Act and/or the Regulations, the NEB Act and Regulations will
                prevail over the Guidelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Neither the NEB Act nor the Regulations provide authority to the
                Board to grant exemptions from Absolute Liability provisions of
                the NEB Act and Regulations; to lower Absolute Liability limits;
                introduce new Absolute Liability Classes; or to accept lower
                amounts of financial resources that companies must maintain.
                Absolute liability limits may only be changed by the Governor in
                Council, on the Minister’s recommendation.

              <p>
                The NEB Act states that the purpose of sections&nbsp;48.12
                to&nbsp;48.17 is to reinforce the “polluter pays” principle by,
                among other things, imposing financial requirements on any
                company that is authorized under the NEB Act to construct or
                operate a pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each company must maintain financial resources equal to its
                Absolute Liability limit, or a greater amount if so specified by
                the Board. In the event of an unintended or uncontrolled
                release, the company must respond appropriately, contain the
                incident, and pay out all claims as appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a company does not comply with an order of the Board in
                respect of any action or measure to be taken in relation to such
                a release, or if the Governor in Council is of the opinion that
                the company does not have or is not likely to have the financial
                resources necessary to pay for the costs incurred or to be
                incurred in relation to a release, and any compensation that
                might be awarded for compensable damage caused by the release,
                then the Governor in Council may designate a company pursuant to
                subsection&nbsp;48.16(1) of the NEB Act. Upon designation, the
                Board may take any action or measure considered necessary in
                relation to the release and may authorize a third party to take
                any such action or measure.

              <p>
                <strong>Absolute Liability</strong> &ndash; The NEB Act states
                that if an unintended or uncontrolled release of Oil, Gas or any
                other commodity from a pipeline occurs, the Company that is
                Authorized under the NEB Act to construct or operate that
                pipeline is liable, without proof of fault or negligence, up to
                the Absolute Liability limit that applies to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means that Companies are liable, regardless of negligence
                or fault, for losses or damages resulting from an unintended or
                uncontrolled release up to certain specified limits. This is
                known as Absolute Liability. The Absolute Liability limit is
                defined in the NEB Act for Major Oil Pipelines, and in the
                Regulations for all other NEB-regulated pipelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Absolute Liability Class</strong> &ndash; The NEB Act
                establishes an Absolute Liability limit of $1&nbsp;billion for
                Companies Authorized to construct or operate one or more
                pipelines that individually or in the aggregate have the
                Capacity to transport at least 250&nbsp;000&nbsp;barrels of Oil
                per day. The Regulations establish classes, Absolute Liability
                limits and financial resource requirements for other
                NEB‑regulated pipeline Companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Authorized</strong> &ndash; The Regulations note that
                authorized, in respect of a pipeline, describes a pipeline whose
                construction and operation have been authorized under Part III

              <p>
                NEB regulated Companies are subject to the Absolute Liability
                provisions of the NEB Act and Regulations. The Absolute
                Liability limits are determined based on various criteria, which
                place Companies into certain classes. The following section
                highlights some key features of the NEB Act and Regulations, and
                provides guidance in terms of how a Company can calculate its
                respective Absolute Liability Class.

              <h4 id="s3_3_a">(a) Oil Pipelines</h4>
              <p>
                The NEB Act and Regulations set out classes of liability based
                on Capacity for Companies that are Authorized to construct or
                operate one or more pipelines that individually or in the
                aggregate have the capacity to transport Oil.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted in the definitions section above, to determine
                Capacity, the Board will rely on the Capacity assuming the
                Board-approved design of the pipeline. This means that, for the
                purposes of determining Absolute Liability, the Board will
                consider Capacity to be a pipeline’s maximum daily Capacity
                assuming the pipeline(s) is (are) operating at 100% of design
                specifications. Capacity will account for all Board-approved
                facility additions, removals, decommissionings, abandonments and
                deactivations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Available capacity, average throughput, or maximum throughput
                over a given time period, will not be relied upon as measures of
                Capacity. The capacity resulting from voluntary, temporary, or
                Board-mandated pressure or flow restrictions will not determine
                Capacity for the purposes of Absolute Liability Class.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Companies Authorized to construct or operate two or more
                unconnected Oil pipelines, the cumulative Board-approved
                Capacity of those pipelines will be used to determine the
                Company’s Absolute Liability level. For example, if a
                NEB-regulated Company has two Oil pipelines, each with
                150,000&nbsp;barrels per day of Capacity, the Company in the
                aggregate has the Capacity to transport 300,000&nbsp;barrels per
                day, and its Absolute Liability limit would be $1&nbsp;billion.
                Where a company operates an oil pipeline system of two or more
                connected lines, the highest Capacity within the system will be
                used to determine the Absolute Liability limit.

                Companies that are Authorized to transport NGLs that do not meet
                the definition of Gas will be considered Oil pipelines for the
                purposes of the Financial Resource Requirements established in
                the NEB Act and Regulations. In other words, Companies that are
                Authorized to transport NGLs that at a temperature of 15°C and a
                pressure of 101.325&nbsp;kPa, are in a
                <strong>liquid</strong> state, will be treated as Oil pipeline
                companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                If Schedule&nbsp;A of a Company’s certificate or order
                authorizes it to transport “NGLs” generally &ndash; without
                specifying the types of NGLs &ndash; or any NGLs that meet the
                definition of “Oil” in the NEB Act, then the Oil Absolute
                Liability limits apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                If Schedule&nbsp;A of a Company’s certificate or order only
                authorizes the transport of NGLs that meet the definition of
                “Gas” under the NEB Act, then the Gas Absolute Liability limits
                apply. The Company is responsible for providing evidence that
                the NGLs it is Authorized to transport meet the definition of
                Gas in the NEB Act.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Company may apply to the Board, pursuant to section&nbsp;21 of
                the NEB Act, to vary Schedule&nbsp;A of its certificate or order
                to more accurately reflect the product it transports.
              </p>
              <h4 id="s3_3_c">(c) Gas Pipelines</h4>
              <p>
                For Gas pipelines, the Absolute Liability level will be
                determined based on Risk Value. If the Company operates two or
                more Gas pipelines, then the Risk Value is that of the pipeline
                with the highest Risk Value.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Risk Value is calculated based on the Board-approved maximum
                operating pressure, and maximum outside diameter on a pipeline
                or pipeline system. For purposes of determining Risk Value for a
                given pipeline, only Board-authorized facility additions,
                removals, decommissionings, abandonments, and deactivations
                should be taken into account. Operational pressure, average
                pressure, or pressure taking into consideration voluntary,
                temporary, or Board‑directed pressure or flow restrictions will
                not be relied on as a basis to determine Risk Value for the
                Absolute Liability Class.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike with Oil pipelines, Risk Value is not “additive” in the
                same way Capacity is additive in determining the Absolute
                Liability Class for a Company that operates multiple Oil
                pipelines. If a Company operates multiple Gas pipelines, its
                Absolute Liability Class is determined based on its Gas pipeline
                with the highest Risk Value.
              </p>
              <h4 id="s3_3_d">(d) Other Commodity</h4>
              <p>
                For pipelines that ship products not meeting the definition of
                Oil or Gas, the other commodity Absolute Liability Classes
                apply. The Company is responsible for providing evidence of the
                commodity it transports.
              </p>
              <h4 id="s3_3_e">
                (e) Changes to Pipeline Capacity or Risk Value
              </h4>
              <p>
                Given that pipelines may go through design changes throughout
                their lifecycle which impact Capacity or Risk Value, Company
                Absolute Liability Classes may change accordingly. For example,
                a pipeline under construction would not be subject to Absolute
                Liability until such time as the pipeline contained a commodity,
                at which point the Company would be subject to Absolute
                Liability. Throughout the Company’s lifecycle, facility
                additions, acquisitions, and/or design changes may result in an
                increase in a Company’s Absolute Liability Class, while
                deactivations, decommissionings, asset sales, and abandonment
                may result in a decrease in a Company’s Absolute Liability
                Class.
              </p>
              <p>
                Practically, a pipeline Company may modify, decommission,
                abandon, or deactivate facilities, which could reduce the
                pipeline’s Capacity or Risk Value to the point where the
                pipeline would be classified in a lower Absolute Liability
                Class. For example, an Oil pipeline Company may apply for and
                receive approval to abandon a pump station, the effect of which
                could be to reduce its Capacity from 55,000&nbsp;barrels per day
                to 40,000&nbsp;barrels per day.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Company must apply to the Board explicitly to have its
                Absolute Liability Class lowered, providing sufficient evidence
                to the Board detailing the impacts of the modification, prior to
                the Board approving a decrease in the Company’s Absolute
                Liability Class. Following Board approval of the lowering of the
                Company’s Absolute Liability Class, the change to Absolute
                Liability Class would become effective once the applied-for
                changes to a Company’s system had been physically completed in
                accordance with any requirements and conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will only consider facility changes that have been
                approved by the Board when calculating a Company’s Capacity or
                Risk Value. Accordingly, reduced throughput levels, voluntary
                pressure restrictions, and other facility changes for which no
                Board order/decision/filings are required will not be
                determinative in assessing a Company’s Absolute Liability Class.
                In addition, Board-directed pressure or flow restrictions will
                not affect a Company’s Absolute Liability Class.

              <p>
                Company must maintain the amount of Financial Resources
                necessary to pay the Absolute Liability limit that applies to it
                or the amount specified by the Board. Each pipeline Company must
                satisfy the Board that it meets the requirement to maintain
                Financial Resources and complies with any Board order specifying
                the type of Financial Resources it must maintain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pursuant to subsection&nbsp;48.13(3) of the NEB Act, Companies
                are required to satisfy the Board that their Financial Resources
                meet the requirements of the NEB Act and Regulations. To do
                this, every Company must file a Financial Resources Plan with
                the Board, and annual compliance filings. The section below
                provides the expectations for filing a Financial Resources Plan,
                as well as the details for annual compliance filings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board will review a Company’s Financial Resources Plan and
                it may order a Company to maintain certain financial resource
                types, in certain amounts. The process will work as follows:

                an affiliate level (e.g., lines of credit or commercial paper
                programs of a parent Company), or whether the resources are
                contingent and provided from a third party (e.g., insurance).
                For any non-directly held resources, the Financial Resources
                Plan should detail whether access is at the NEB-regulated
                Company’s sole discretion, or otherwise encumbered (and if so,

              <p>
                Subsection&nbsp;48.13(1) of the Act stipulates that “a
                <strong>Company that is Authorized under this [NEB] Act</strong>
                to construct or operate a pipeline shall maintain […] Financial
                Resources”. Accordingly, the Board will not rely on Financial
                Resources of a parent or affiliate as a demonstration of
                “maintaining” Financial Resources at the operating Company
                level, absent a parental/affiliate guarantee, a line of credit
                with a parent/affiliate guarantor, or some other instrument or
                mechanism providing direct, unencumbered access to those parent
                company Financial Resources at the authorization holder
                Company’s sole discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
                For any Financial Resources Plan that intends to place reliance
                on the resources of a parent or affiliate, a detailed corporate
                structure diagram must be provided. Additionally, a description
                of the mechanism or instrument that provides access to
                parent/affiliate funds (such as a letter of guarantee or line of
                credit), as well as a copy of the instrument, must be provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board notes that some Companies may be a “named beneficiary”
                or a “named insured” on broad, corporate-wide insurance
                policies. As long as the Company is a named insured or named
                beneficiary, the Board will consider the insurance coverage as
                part of a Financial Resources Plan, to the extent the Company
                has coverage under the policy.
              </p>
              <h3 id="s4_3">4.3 Sole Reliance on Insurance</h3>
              <p>
                If a Company plans to rely only on insurance to demonstrate
                Financial Resources (other than for readily accessible financial
                resources, as described in the next section), then it should
                explain how it can fund initial release response measures in a
                timely manner. A Company should also describe the potential
                steps necessary to fund release response measures and the
                timelines for each step, including for insurance claims to be
                submitted, processed, and paid. The Board expects companies to
                take into consideration the timing of access for various types
                of resources, such as cash on hand, internal resources, credit
                lines, insurance and any other financial resources, and ensure
                the timing is aligned with the expected timing of expenses in
                the event of a release.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, if a Company chooses to place a high degree of reliance
                on insurance as part of its Financial Resources Plan (for
                example, &gt;50% of its financial resources being composed of
                insurance), the Board would expect the Company to further
                justify this approach in part by describing its risk, operating
                characteristics, and potential exposure to sudden financial
                resource draws in the event of a release. The Board will review
                each Financial Resources Plan on a case‑by-case basis.
              </p>
              <h3 id="s4_4">4.4 Readily Accessible Resources</h3>
              <p>
                The Regulations stipulate that a Company that operates one or
                more Authorized pipelines referred to in paragraphs&nbsp;2(1)(a)
                to (d) must maintain at least 5% of the amount of Financial
                Resources referred to in subsection&nbsp;48.13(1) of the NEB Act
                in types that are readily accessible. A Company that operates
                one or more Authorized pipelines referred to in
                paragraphs&nbsp;2(1)(e) to&nbsp;(i) must maintain at least 2.5%
                of the amount of Financial Resources referred to in
                subsection&nbsp;48.13(1) of the NEB Act in types that are
                readily accessible. Should the NEB direct companies to maintain
                financial resources in readily accessible types, the types it
                can direct include: letters of credit; lines of credit;
                participation in a pooled fund, as referred to in
                subsection&nbsp;48.14(1) of the NEB Act; and, cash or cash
                equivalents.
              </p>
              <p>
                These funds must be accessible within
                five&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;business days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Accordingly, the readily accessible requirement is as follows,

                6. Increasing of Financial Requirements by the NEB
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Board has no authority to increase Absolute Liability
                limits. Absolute Liability limits are set out in the NEB Act and
                Regulations. The NEB Act states that the Governor in Council
                may, by regulation, on the Minister’s recommendation, prescribe
                an amount greater than one&nbsp;billion dollars for Major Oil
                Pipeline Companies, and prescribe Absolute Liability limits for
                all Non‑Major Oil Pipeline Companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the Board does have the discretion, pursuant to
                subsection&nbsp;48.13(1) of the NEB Act, to require a Company to
                maintain Financial Resources in an amount greater than its
                corresponding Absolute Liability amount. The Board may exercise
                this discretion on a case-by-case basis.

              <p>
                Subsection&nbsp;48.13(2) of the NEB Act indicates that the Board
                may order a Company, or as a member of a class of Companies, to
                maintain Financial Resources in certain types, and in certain
                amounts of each type. The Regulations prescribe a list of
                financial resource types, and a list of readily accessible
                types, from which the Board may choose to direct Companies to
                maintain.
              </p>
              <p>
                The financial resource types are prescribed via the Regulations

              </ul>
              <p>

                minimum amounts of Financial Resources in a form that is readily
                accessible to the Company, as reiterated in Table&nbsp;2 above.
                The financial instruments the NEB could order a Company to use
                are set out in the Regulations and would be one or more of the
                following for the purposes of the Readily Accessible Portion:

                following financial resource types, the Financial Resources
                should contain the following attributes:

              <h4 id="s7_1_a">(a) Insurance</h4>
              <p>
                Any Company relying on insurance to satisfy its requirement to
                maintain Financial Resources should have policies in place with
                conditions suitable to cover the scope of operations of the
                Company, and applicable to the exposures involved in its
                activities. A Company relying on insurance must provide a
                certificate of insurance, containing an overview of its
                insurance policies, detailing at a minimum:
              </p>

              <p>
                Should notice of cancellation of insurance be issued by
                insurers, the Company shall act to remove the reason for
                cancellation, or shall act immediately to obtain alternative
                insurance, and shall inform the Board of the actions taken to

                with an escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Board and a
                Company. Such agreement would acknowledge receipt of the
                requisite amount of Financial Resources that would be
                established in an escrow fund. The escrow fund would be managed
                and governed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
                escrow agreement.

                  of the line of credit including notice of cancellation,
                  secured/unsecured, total amount, undrawn portion.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board will only rely on the undrawn portion of a line of
                credit in consideration of the sum of Financial Resources a
                Company is maintaining. The Board may direct Companies to report
                if the undrawn portion of a credit line drops below a certain
                threshold, as required. The Board may also direct Companies to
                report if the Line of Credit is terminated, modified or amended.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board has also approved lines of credit from parent
                companies/affiliates as acceptable Financial Resources, with the
                following attributes:

              </ul>
              <h4 id="s7_1_e">(e) Participation in a Pooled Fund</h4>
              <p>
                A Company may provide proof of its participation in a pooled
                fund to maintain Financial Resources. In the event a Company
                participates in a pooled fund, it must meet the requirements set
                out in section&nbsp;5 of the Regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the Board would expect that for a pooled fund to be
                satisfactory:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  Funds must be maintained in a segregated account and not be
                  commingled with fund participants’ general funds;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The administrator of the fund must be an independent, third
                  party acceptable to the Board or any successor administrative
                  body;
                </li>
                <li>Funds must be protected from creditors;</li>
                <li>
                  Funds must be protected from misuse or use for a purpose other
                  than responding to a release;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The pooled fund shall only be used for the purpose of meeting
                  the financial resource requirements and shall not otherwise be
                  encumbered; and,
                </li>
                <li>
                  Funds must be liquid and payable to the Board or any successor
                  administrative body within five&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;days of the
                  Board’s demand.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Board would likely require that it review and approve the
                terms on which any pooled fund is created and administered.
                After such a review, the Board may provide further guidance or
                direction as necessary.

              <h4 id="s7_1_f">(f) Parent Company Guarantee</h4>
              <p>
                A parental guarantee agreement must provide proof that there are
                sufficient funds at a parent company level to cover the
                Financial Resources for its NEB-regulated Company. This parental
                guarantee agreement must be accompanied by the most recent
                audited financial statements of the parent company, as well as
                any subsequently completed unaudited quarterly statements and,
                if available, the most recent credit rating reports from the
                guarantor. The Financial Resources of the parent company will
                only be relied on for the amount of the guarantee agreement.
              </p>
              <p>Furthermore, the guarantee should:</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Require that in the event of default of either the guarantor
                  or the NEB-regulated Company, the Board or any successor
                  administrative body be served notice of default within
                  two&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;business days.

              <p>
                The Board may consider a surety bond as proof of Financial
                Resources subject to the surety bond having terms as follows:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  The surety must be regulated by the Office of the
                  Superintendent of Financial Institutions;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The obligee must be the “Her Majesty the Queen in Right of

                  successor administrative body”;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The term of the bond must be indefinite. The bond may have a
                  form of evergreen provision that automatically renews the bond
                  unless notice of termination is given;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bond must be terminable by the surety providing
                  sixty&nbsp;(60)&nbsp;days’ notice, with the obligee then
                  having a further sixty&nbsp;(60)&nbsp;day period to make a

                </li>
                <li>
                  The bond must be structured as an on demand instrument. This
                  may be accomplished by requiring the surety to pay the bond
                  amount upon receiving a written demand of the obligee;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bond must reference the underlying regulatory obligations
                  of the principal. For Financial Resources, the bond should
                  reference the NEB Act, specifically subsection&nbsp;48.13(1),
                  48.13(3), (and 48.13(2) if applicable); and,
                </li>
                <li>
                  The surety may fulfill its obligations under the bond by:

                  pipeline Company’s obligations under the Financial Resource
                  Requirements established in the NEB Act and Regulations, or
                  (iii) paying the bond balance to the Board. If these options
                  are set out in the bond, then the Board must have the

                there will be, any material revisions to its Financial Resources

                Company’s financial position, significant draws of credit, or
                cancellation/amendments to insurance policies that may put at
                risk a Company’s ability to maintain Financial Resources equal
                to its Absolute Liability limit or higher if ordered by the

                becomes aware of the development, using the Board’s e-filing
                system. This also includes any reported change to a Company’s
                ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Any resulting
                changes that are required to a Company’s Financial Resources
                Plan must be e-filed within fifteen&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;business days

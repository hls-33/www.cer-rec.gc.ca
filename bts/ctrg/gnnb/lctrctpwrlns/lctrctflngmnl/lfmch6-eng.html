          <p>
            This chapter describes the NEB&rsquo;s environmental and
            socio-economic assessment responsibilities and process and outlines
            the information required in a complete application. Chapter&nbsp;6
            consists of two broad parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subsections&nbsp;6.2 to&nbsp;6.4 will assist an applicant in
            understanding how a project is evaluated and how an applicant should
            provide information:
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2 &ndash; The NEB&rsquo;s Approach to Environmental and
            Socio-Economic Assessment;

          </p>
          <p>6.4 &ndash; Level of Detail.</p>
          <p>
            The applicant should carefully review the information in
            subsections&nbsp;6.2 through&nbsp;6.4 to properly understand the
            requirements outlined in the subsections that follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of the chapter, subsections&nbsp;6.5 to&nbsp;6.8,
            describes the information applicants should include in a
            project-specific Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA):
          </p>

          <p>6.6 &ndash; Effects Assessment;</p>
          <p>6.7 &ndash; Cumulative Effects Assessment; and</p>
          <p>6.8 &ndash; Inspection, Monitoring and Follow-up.</p>
          <p>
            In addition to the description of the project (discussed in
            Chapter&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4 of this Manual), the applicant should
            describe:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the environmental and socio-economic baseline setting;</li>
            <li>
              the predicted beneficial and adverse effects of the proposed
              project on the socio-economic and biophysical environment over the
              life of the project;
            </li>
            <li>
              the methods used for effects analysis, and the rationale for
              selecting the methods chosen;
            </li>
            <li>the proposed mitigation measures; and</li>
            <li>
              the predicted significance of residual project effects and

            project (construction, operation, maintenance and abandonment),
            including the potential for accidents and malfunctions during each
            phase. Tables&nbsp;6-2 and&nbsp;6-3, which follow

            6.2 The NEB’s Approach to Environmental and Socio-Economic
            Assessment
          </h2>
          <p>
            The NEB has a broad mandate under the NEB Act and it may consider
            matters that appear to the Board to be directly related to the
            international powerlines (IPL) and relevant to its decisions or
            recommendations. The NEB's environmental and socio-economic
            assessment responsibilities cover four distinct phases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              evaluating potential effects of constructing and operating
              proposed projects;
            </li>
            <li>
              monitoring and enforcing terms and conditions before, during and
              after construction;
            </li>
            <li>
              monitoring and regulating ongoing operations, including
              decommissioning; and
            </li>
            <li>evaluating potential effects of abandonment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB&rsquo;s objective for environmental and socio-economic
            assessment are that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the potential effects of projects receive thorough consideration
              before any decisions on the project are made allowing a project to
              proceed;
            </li>
            <li>
              projects are not likely to cause significant adverse effects or
              contribute to significant adverse cumulative effects;
            </li>
            <li>
              there is an opportunity for meaningful public and Aboriginal
              participation; and
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            the NEB&rsquo;s process and its decisions or recommendations are
            transparent and reflect the input received from those participating
            in the environmental assessment and regulatory review process.

          <h3 id="s6_3_1" class="list-unstyled">6.3.1 What is Scoping?</h3>
          <p>
            Appropriate scoping is the foundation upon which an efficient and
            effective environmental and socio-economic assessment is built.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope ensures that the assessment focuses on relevant issues and
            concerns, and assists in determining the appropriate level of detail
            to include in the assessment. Proper scoping reduces the risk of
            including unimportant or irrelevant information in the assessment or
            excluding factors that should be assessed.Scoping is the process of
            identifying:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the physical facilities and activities to include within the ESA;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              what biophysical and socio-economic elements are likely to be
              affected.

            6.3.2 The Applicant's Role in Scoping
          </h3>
          <p>The applicant&rsquo;s role in scoping includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              providing sufficient information for the NEB to fully understand
              the nature of the project it is to assess;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensuring the applicant&rsquo;s ESA focuses on relevant issues and
              concerns, including those identified by affected parties, and that
              an appropriate level of detail is included in the ESA; and
            </li>
            <li>
              considering the factors set out in s.19 of the CEA Act 2012 as
              applicable (see Factors to be Considered below), even for projects
              not governed by the CEA Act 2012.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To assist an applicant in scoping before filing an application, the
            NEB encourages the applicant to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              request a meeting with Board staff to discuss process-related
              matters and be guided to examples of complete ESAs filed
              previously with the Board (see Section&nbsp;1.6 &ndash;
              Pre-Application Meetings Guidance Notes);
            </li>
            <li>
              consult any relevant Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEA
              Agency) guidance documents and if appropriate, discuss scoping
              with any other relevant federal authorities (see Table&nbsp;5-1
              for potential considerations and contacts); and
            </li>
            <li>
              where appropriate, consult with other regulatory bodies at the
              provincial, territorial, regional, municipal or Aboriginal levels
              of government.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An application must clearly identify, describe and substantiate:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the scope of the applied for project;</li>
            <li>
              other physical facilities and activities necessary to enable the
              project to proceed, including directly-related ancillary
              facilities, such as access roads including temporary and permanent
              bridge crossings, or construction camps; and
            </li>
            <li>
              other physical facilities and activities likely to occur if the
              applied for project is approved and proceeds, which may include
              other power lines and works directly related to the proposed
              project.

          </h3>
          <p>
            The scope of the project includes the physical facilities and
            activities making up the project and enabling it to proceed as
            applied for by the proponent. It may also include other physical
            facilities and activities that would be undertaken if the applied
            for project is approved and proceeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB determines the scope of the project by considering relevant
            case law, CEA Agency guidance and any other relevant commentary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB will review and assess the scope of the ESA based on the
            evidence before it. Although elements of the project or the scope of
            factors to be considered may change over the course of a proceeding
            (e.g., as a result of public or Aboriginal input, or changes to the
            project), the application is usually the prime source of information
            and starting point for establishing what the Board will consider in
            the environmental assessment of a project.
          </p>
          <p>
            For projects subject to a public hearing, the NEB will release a
            List of Issues that sets out the issues the Board will consider in
            the hearing. Within the List of Issues, environmental matters are
            usually identified at a sufficiently broad level that all relevant
            environmental effects may be considered. It is important to note the
            requirements within this Filing Manual amount to a standing scoping
            document in lieu of the NEB preparing a project-specific scoping
            document for every project.

            <p><strong>FYI -&nbsp;Reminder...</strong></p>
            <p>
              The requirements contained within this Filing Manual are
              essentially a generic scope of the assessment document applicable
              to any facility project. The description of the project within the
              proponent&rsquo;s application sets out the scope of the project.
              If the information submitted is not sufficient for the NEB to be
              clear on scope, the NEB will request more information, which could
              lengthen the assessment process.

            In evaluating whether to include other physical facilities and
            activities directly related to the proposed project, but which may
            be outside of the NEB&rsquo;s regulatory jurisdiction, the Board may
            consider factors such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Is the physical facility or activity within the control of the
              applicant for the primary project being applied for under the NEB
              Act?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are mitigation measures and follow-up activities enforceable by
              the NEB, another federal or provincial department or agency, or
              person or body that will ensure implementation?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are effects from the other physical facilities and activities
              relevant to the Board&rsquo;s decision or recommendation under the
              NEB Act?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>CEA Act 2012 Designated Physical Activities</h4>
          <p>
            For physical activities designated under the CEA Act 2012, the NEB
            as the Responsible Authority must prepare a description of the
            factors to be taken into account in the EA and the scope of those
            factors. Section&nbsp;19 of CEA Act 2012 sets out the factors that
            must be taken into account. It is critical that applicants, in
            preparing their ESA&rsquo;s, apply section&nbsp;19 and consider the
            scope of those factors based on guidance in this Filing Manual.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s6_4">6.4 Level of Detail</h2>
          <p>
            The nature of the project, together with the environmental and
            socio-economic setting, establish the extent of interactions between
            the project and the environment. Those interactions form the basis
            on which effects are predicted, and for understanding the
            appropriate level of detail needed about the setting, interactions,
            and predicted effects. The extent of public interest may also guide
            the applicant in determining the level of detail necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the project may impact Aboriginal communities and affect the
            use of traditional territory or potential or established treaty or
            Aboriginal rights, applicants must identify the potentially-affected
            Aboriginal groups and carry out effective consultations with them to
            determine their views and concerns. If there are potential impacts,
            applicants must file information about the Aboriginal groups
            affected, the concerns they have raised, how the applicant will
            address the concerns and identify any outstanding concerns. The
            level of detail provided should reflect the nature and extent of the
            impacts, the nature of the rights or interests affected and the
            degree of concern expressed by Aboriginal groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information provided by an applicant in its ESA must be of
            sufficient detail to allow the NEB to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              identify the spatial and temporal extent of interactions between
              the project and the biophysical and human environments;
            </li>
            <li>identify the potential effects of the project;</li>
            <li>
              identify the potential for the environment to affect the project;
              and
            </li>
            <li>determine the significance of those effects.</li>

            <p><strong>FYI -&nbsp;Example...</strong></p>
            <p>
              As an example, a project crossing a small and ephemeral
              watercourse during the dry perod, with no activities or physical
              works within the fisheries sensitive zone, would likely require
              less detail of effects on fish and fish habitat than a project
              requiring in-stream construction work in a fish-bearing
              watercourse during spawning periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              The applicant must clearly rationalize the level of detail
              provided. This is typically reflected through the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Description of the project: information describing how the
                project would cross the watercourse, (primary and alternative
                methods) and whether any physical works or construction would be
                required in or immediately adjacent to the watercourse, and if
                so, what these could be and how they might take place;
              </li>
              <li>
                Environmental setting: information on  the nature of the
                watercourse, shores, riparian zones, erosive features, its
                fisheries and fish habitat potential;
              </li>
              <li>
                Interactions: information detailing the proposed timing of
                construction, the spatial extent of interactions, any loss of
                riparian or fish habitat, and extent of any potential release of
                a deleterious substance into the watercourse;
              </li>
              <li>
                Predicted effects: information on any direct and indirect
                effects on water quality, habitat, fish and on which life stage,
                or any effects on other wildlife; and
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Results of consultation with other regulators: information
              detailing the results of any consultation with Fisheries and
              Oceans Canada, or the measures that will be taken to ensure
              compliance with the Fisheries Act with respect to fisheries
              protection.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The ESA must include both quantitative and qualitative information.
            Applicants must consider the extent to which detailed maps, survey
            and trend data, or diagrams or figures relating to specific areas of
            biophysical or socio-economic elements of interest or concern may
            enhance the assessment. The number and nature of biophysical and
            socio-economic elements considered within an ESA, and the supporting
            level of detail necessary, will vary depending on the setting and
            issues raised about the project.

          <h4>Study Area</h4>
          <p>
            The study area(s) must be of sufficient size to encompass the
            spatial boundaries of the project related facilities or activities
            (e.g., access roads, temporary and permanent bridges).
          </p>
          <p>
            The study area must cover at least one kilometer on each side of the
            power line. It must also to be of sufficient size and orientation to
            encompass all areas where valued components may be affected by the
            project, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>areas downstream and immediately upstream;</li>
            <li>
              areas in which the project may be within the range of vision;

          <h4>Guidance -&nbsp;Identification and Analysis of Effects</h4>
          <p>
            The identification and analysis of project effects builds directly
            on scoping, the description of the environmental and socio-economic
            setting, and the level of detail considerations described above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, applicants use a valued component approach to focus the
            effects analysis on practical and representative components of the
            biophysical and socio-economic environment. Valued components could
            be the broad elements described in Tables&nbsp;6-1, 6-2 and&nbsp;6-3
            or a representative subset of those elements. In that way, the
            analysis of potential effects focuses on the components of those
            biophysical or socio-economic elements where project-environment
            interactions are more readily assessable, and on the interactions
            that may be of concern to the public or Aboriginal groups (often
            termed Valued Environmental Components [VECs] or Valued
            Socio-Economic Components [VSCs]). The valued components selected
            must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              be indicative of predicted effects that could result from the
              project over time;
            </li>
            <li>
              have baseline data available in order to determine the
              significance of effects; and
            </li>
            <li>
              be able to reflect measurable changes that result from the project
              effects over time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The analysis should result in an understanding of where uncertainty
            about project-environment interactions may exist, or where
            information gaps necessary to predict effects may remain.
          </p>
          <h5>Spatial and Temporal Boundaries</h5>
          <p>The spatial and temporal boundaries should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              be provided for each valued component, along with a rationale for
              selecting those boundaries;
            </li>
            <li>
              include the area over which effects on valued components may
              occur. This area could include a  population boundary, home range,
              airshed, watershed, Aboriginal traditional land and resource use
              area, or municipal or regional planning district;
            </li>
            <li>
              include the duration that each valued component may be affected;
            </li>
            <li>
              consider the effects of the project on the valued component and
              the extent to which those effects are measurable;
            </li>
            <li>include all phases of the project; and</li>
            <li>not be constrained by jurisdictional boundaries.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Analysis</h5>
          <p>
            The analysis methods must be fully disclosed and meet the study
            needs. In addition to meeting the requirements of other regulations
            (e.g., Species at Risk Act [SARA], Migratory Bird Convention Act
            [MBCA], Fisheries Act, etc.), the analysis of project effects must
            take into account local, regional and federal policy or management
            objectives (e.g., recovery strategies, action plans, management
            plans and land use plans) and thresholds. Where there are no
            management objectives or thresholds, include information on the
            current state of knowledge on the valued component. After a review
            of the available literature, if the state of knowledge is incomplete
            or there is substantial uncertainty, identify any information gaps,
            and indicate if and how they will be filled. Where uncertainty
            exists about the project effects on a valued component, describe how
            the inspection and monitoring program will reduce the uncertainity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where there is applicable local and traditional knowledge, it must
            be included in the ESA. See Section&nbsp;5.3 Consultation, for
            further details on consulting with Aboriginal persons and groups and
            gathering traditional knowledge.
          </p>
          <h5>Effects Assessment for Accidents and Malfunctions</h5>
          <p>
            The prevention of any accidents and malfunctions associated with
            NEB-regulated projects is the NEB&rsquo;s goal. In the event an
            accident or malfunction does occur, the Board will hold its
            regulated companies accountable for an appropriate response under
            their Emergency Management Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The applicant&rsquo;s ESA must identify and assess the effects on
            workers, the public, and biophysical and socio-economic elements of
            all potential accidents and malfunctions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accidents and malfunctions and associated emergencies can result
            from numerous events, including equipment failure, human error,
            natural perils such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, or
            earthquakes, and terrorism or other criminal activities.
            Multi-hazard emergencies, such as an earthquake, may cause facility
            damage, fires and explosions, which result in injury and further
            property damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The level of detail provided on potential effects of accidents and
            malfunctions will depend on the:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>type, scale, and location of the proposed project;</li>
            <li>
              environmental and socio-economic sensitivities within potentially
              affected areas; and
            </li>
            <li>
              extent to which an applicant&rsquo;s existing Emergency Management
              Program and other plans and manuals address the issues and
              concerns about the proposed project.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Abandonment</h5>
          <p>The abandonment of an IPL requires an application to the Board.</p>
          <p>
            For an application to construct and operate an IPL, the level of
            detail provided may be constrained by the uncertainties inherent
            with forecasting a phase of the project that may be several decades
            in the future.&nbsp; However, an abandonment application should
            outline what project components would be removed and how the right
            of way would be returned to a state comparable with the surrounding
            environment.

                    If more than one mitigation measure is proposed as a
                    possibility for any particular effect, provide the
                    applicable criteria for selecting the mitigation to use, or
                    describe how measures would be combined to mitigate against
                    a single effect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If new mitigation measures are to be used, provide any test
                    results or a technically based rationale for their use and
                    describe how their effectiveness will be evaluated.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ensure mitigation measures are appropriate for the scale of
                    impacts predicted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If project effects cannot be avoided, mitigation must reduce
                    or compensate for them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Where an applicant hires a third party to prepare its ESA,
                    provide a statement committing to adopting and implementing
                    all mitigation recommendations included in the ESA. Explain
                    any mitigation recommendations not adopted and provide
                    alternative approaches, as appropriate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Identify the conditions of approvals or permits required by
                    other regulatory bodies related to the mitigation of
                    environmental or socio-economic effects. Describe how
                    commitments regarding mitigative measures will be
                    communicated to field staff for implementation.
                  </li>

              </li>

              <li>
                2. Ensure that commitments about mitigative measures will be
                communicated to field staff for implementation through an
                Environmental Protection Plan (EP Plan). An EP Plan might be
                simple and concise for smaller, less complex projects but for
                certain projects (see guidance below), the NEB may require a
                comprehensive EP Plan. An EP Plan must include all environmental
                commitments specific to the project and include or
                cross-reference other plans and programs relied on. Describe any
                plans or programs that may be used to mitigate potential effects
                (e.g., waste management plans, invasive species plans,
                horizontal directional drill contingency plans, heritage
                resource discovery contingency plans, etc.).
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Describe plans and measures to address potential effects of
                accidents and malfunctions during construction and operation of
                the project (see guidance under Identification and Analysis of
                Effects, Accidents and Malfunctions in Subsection&nbsp;6.6.1).

            </ul>
          </div>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <h5>Mitigation Measures</h5>
          <p>Mitigation measures are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>developed during a project&rsquo;s feasibility study;</li>
            <li>developed during project design;</li>
            <li>defined in the project plan;</li>
            <li>
              refined as the ESA progresses and the project&rsquo;s predicted
              environmental and socio-economic effects become more certain, and
            </li>
            <li>may be standard or project-specific measures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The identification and analysis of effects and mitigation measures
            may be presented together.
          </p>
          <h5>Mitigation Options</h5>
          <p>
            At the application stage of the proposed project many mitigation
            measures may still be tentative, subject to further detailed design
            and to site specific environmental conditions. For these cases the
            ESA should describe:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the different mitigative options available and being considered;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              the criteria that will be used for selecting the actual mitigation
              to be implemented.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Including the options and selection criteria for contingency
            measures in an EP Plan may avoid having to submit variance
            applications to the NEB if changes in field conditions require use
            of construction alternatives.
          </p>
          <div
            class="col-md-12 well well-sm brdr-tp brdr-rght brdr-bttm brdr-lft"
          >
            <p><strong>FYI -&nbsp;Reminder...</strong></p>
            <p>
              In some cases, the proposed route or site, route segments,
              facility design or construction methods may themselves be forms of
              environmental mitigation when compared to alternative routing,
              design or construction methods. This may be demonstrated in the
              application&rsquo;s discussion of alternatives (see
              section&nbsp;4.5) by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                identifying which design features and construction methods are
                considered to be mitigation;
              </li>
              <li>
                identifying any alternatives that were considered to these
                features or methods and the proposed routing; and
              </li>
              <li>
                providing a comparative analysis of the mitigation measures
                considered.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h5>Environmental Protection Plan (EP Plan)</h5>
          <p>
            Although the NEB expects an EP Plan to be prepared for all projects,
            the size and scope of an EP Plan will vary. An EP Plan is specific
            to a project and is a tool to communicate a company&rsquo;s
            environmental protection procedures and mitigation measures to
            employees, contractors, and regulators. The purpose of an EP Plan is
            to document and communicate all project-specific environmental
            commitments made by an applicant and the associated mitigation
            measures in a clear and user-friendly format.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB may request a comprehensive EP Plan during the examination
            of an application, or as a condition of approval to be complied with
            before construction. The NEB may expect a comprehensive EP Plan to
            be filed under the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              when the applicant does not have up-to-date company manuals on
              file with the NEB that document its environmental protecction
              procedures;
            </li>
            <li>
              if site-specific or project-specific mitigation or protection
              measures are provided by the applicant as commitments to avoid or
              address predicted adverse environmental effects in the
              application; or
            </li>
            <li>
              if the application and assessment process is lengthy or complex,
              and environmental protection measures and commitments are
              contained in several different places or documents (e.g.,
              responses to information requests).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Comprehensive EP Plans are typically required for larger facility
            applications. In these circumstances, the NEB encourages companies
            to submit a draft EP Plan containing all preliminary environmental
            protection and mitigation measures with their application to assist
            the NEB in assessing the application. Should the project be
            approved, the NEB often requires the company to file an updated EP
            Plan before starting construction.
          </p>
          <p>When preparing its EP Plan, an applicant should consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              identifing specific goals for protecting environmental elements
              and addressing socio-economic elements;
            </li>
            <li>
              describing the environmental protection objective for each goal,
              and providing mitigative options to meet those objectives based on
              site-specific conditions; and
            </li>
            <li>
              providing decision-making criteria for choosing which measures and
              procedures to implement and under what circumstances for each
              objective.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Draft EP Plan</h5>
          <p>
            If a draft EP Plan is filed with the application, it should contain:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the purpose of the EP Plan, a summary of the project with a map,
              and a description of how environmental compliance would be
              achieved for the project;
            </li>
            <li>
              the resource-specific mitigation to be applied for the project,
              and the general environmental protection measures for each phase
              of construction;
            </li>
            <li>
              relevant construction specifications and drawings to execute
              environmental mitigation measures, and the corresponding
              environmental alignment sheets;
            </li>
            <li>
              other more detailed plans as applicable (e.g., waste management
              plan, emergency and security management plans, contingency plans,
              and other element-specific management plans and programs);
            </li>
            <li>
              the assignment of accountabilities and responsibilities for
              carrying out practices and procedures, making criteria-based
              decisions and confirming compliance with the Environmental
              Protection Program; and
            </li>
            <li>
              a table of contacts for reporting environmental incidents as
              required by other regulators.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Final EP Plan</h5>
          <p>A final comprehensive EP Plan must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>include all items required in a draft EP Plan;</li>
            <li>
              if relevant, include an amendment or concordance table detailing
              changes from the draft to final version of the EP Plan;
            </li>
            <li>
              incorporate all environmental commitments made during the NEB
              application assessment process, including all requirements set out
              in permits, certificates, or any other authorizations;
            </li>
            <li>
              include a copy of any NEB discussion or assessment of
              environmental matters as set out in or attached to the NEB
              certificate or permit;
            </li>
            <li>
              include additional requirements as a result of season-specific
              field surveys conducted before construction;
            </li>
            <li>
              include the GPS locations for environmentally-sensitive areas
              identified in the surveys; and
            </li>
            <li>
              include updated environmental alignment sheets summarizing all
              pertinent environmental issues and the corresponding mitigation
              measures that will be implemented during construction.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Variances to the EP Plan</h5>
          <p>
            It is the responsibility of the company to apply to the Board for
            variances to the commitments made in the application, in the
            application assessment process or as required in the project
            approval conditions. It is therefore of benefit to the applicant to
            incorporate decision making criteria for choosing which measures and
            procedures to implement and under what circumstances. Where this is
            done, there may be sufficient flexibility to respond to changes that
            result in the field without filing a variance application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further information about variation applications can be obtained

          <h5>Waste Management Plan</h5>
          <p>
            A waste management plan for the control of contaminated and
            non-contaminated waste from the project is required. The plan must
            describe the purpose of the plan, the types of waste anticipated,
            the resulting prevention and mitigation measures to be applied to
            manage that waste, and how any relevant reporting requirements will
            be met. The plan must also include a reporting structure, contact
            list and reference to other applicable legislation.

            An applicant&rsquo;s programs, plans and manuals should be
            considered as part of its mitigation of potential effects of
            accidents and malfunctions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There may also be project-specific plans and commitments an
            applicant should consider as part of its mitigation of potential
            effects of accidents and malfunctions. As noted in Section&nbsp;6.1,
            these must also be incorporated into a company&rsquo;s programs as

            <li>
              Evaluate the significance of residual adverse environmental and
              socio-economic effects against the defined criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evaluate the likelihood of significant residual adverse
              environmental and socio-economic occuring and substantiate the

            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Guidance &ndash; Applicant’s Evaluation of Significance</h4>
          <p>
            Evaluating environmental and socio-econmic effects consists of
            assessing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>whether the effects are adverse;</li>
            <li>whether the adverse effects are significant; and</li>
            <li>whether the significant adverse effects are likely.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A common way for an applicant to assess a project's effects is to
            compare the quality of the existing environment with the predicted
            quality of the environment if the project is approved and built. The
            direction of change to the environment may be adverse, neutral or
            beneficial.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following criteria may be useful in assessing the significance
            of a project&rsquo;s adverse effects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>magnitude;</li>
            <li>duration;</li>
            <li>frequency;</li>
            <li>geographic extent;</li>
            <li>ecological context; and</li>
            <li>reversibility or degree of permanence.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In applying these criteria to each residual effect, an applicant
            must define each criteria and the range considered within each
            criteria. To help evaluate the significance of a particular effect
            and define the point at which it becomes &ldquo;significant&rdquo;,
            consider providing rating attributes (e.g., low / moderate / high)
            for each significance criteria and defining the range of each
            attribute. An applicant must also describe how each criterion or
            combination of criteria was used to reach the applicant&rsquo;s
            significance conclusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Definitions for rating criteria are expected to be quantitative and
            based on standards, guidelines, objectives or other established and
            accepted ecological thresholds. In the absence of any such
            references or regulatory guidance, or where these are not
            quantitative (e.g., it may not be appropriate to set thresholds to
            determine &quot;acceptable levels of change&quot;, in relation to
            all socio-economic effects), then rating attribute definitions must
            be qualitative and based on available research literature.
            Applicants must also consider the level and nature of concerns
            raised by the public and address issues of concern to Aboriginal
            groups potentially affected by the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The significance of adverse effects could also be assessed by
            comparing effects to conformity requirements within approved land
            use plans or conducting a quantitative risk assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where professional judgement is used to determine the significance
            of adverse effects, the extent of reliance on professional judgement
            must be described and rationale for the extent of the reliance must
            be provided. An applicant&rsquo;s ESA must provide an evaluation of
            the likelihood and significance of any adverse environmental
            effects, for consideration by the NEB.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assessing the likelihood of significant adverse effects must be
            based on the probability of occurrence and state the level of
            scientific uncertainty. If a qualitative determination of the
            likelihood of significant adverse effects is used, provide a clear
            rationale and supporting information.

          <h4>Guidance &ndash; Scoping and Analysis of Cumulative Effects</h4>
          <h5>Cumulative Effects Assessment</h5>
          <p>
            Assessing cumulative effects typically requires the same method of
            analysis as described in the project-specific effects assessment. As
            discussed in Subsections&nbsp;6.3 to&nbsp;6.6., the baseline
            information, project description and project-specific mitigation
            measures already captured in the application must be provided in
            enough detail to characterize the extent of the residual effects of
            the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subsection&nbsp;6.6 and Tables&nbsp;6-2 and&nbsp;6-3 outline the
            type of information required for a project-specific effects
            assessment. Although the tables also make specific note of
            information required for a cumulative effects assessment for valued
            components, all information requirements contained in the tables
            should be evaluated, as appropriate, as a guide for applicants in
            completing a cumulative effects assessment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cumulative effects assessment differs from a conventional
            project-specific effects assessment in that it typically includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>larger geographic study areas;</li>
            <li>longer time frames;</li>
            <li>
              environmental and socio-economic effects associated with physical
              facilities or activities that may not be directly related to the
              applied for project (e.g., upstream or downstream facilities not
              within the Board&rsquo;s jurisdiction, a proposed highway project
              or residential sub-division in the study area, ongoing forestry or
              agricultural activities); and
            </li>
            <li>
              spatial boundaries that are generally not constrained by
              jurisdictional boundaries.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The level of effort and scale of the cumulative effects assessment
            should be appropriate to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the nature and context of the project under assessment;</li>
            <li>its potential residual effects; and</li>
            <li>
              the environmental and socio-economic setting (e.g., an increased
              level of detail may be required when rapid or intensive
              development of the region has occurred or is anticipated, or
              particular environmental or socio-economic sensitivities or risks
              are involved, such as significant Aboriginal traditional use).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Applicants should also consult the CEA Agency&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;Operational Policy Statement &ndash; Assessing Cumulative
            Environmental Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment
            Act, 2012&rdquo;.
          </p>
          <h5>Other Physical Facilities or Activities</h5>
          <p>
            Provide clear reasoning, with supporting rationale, for selecting
            the other existing and future physical facilities or activities to
            be included within the cumulative effects assessment. When
            identifying other physical facilities or activities, include those
            physical facilities or activities likely to take place as opposed to
            those not reasonably foreseeable or hypothetical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consideration of other physical facilities or activities that have
            been or will be carried out within the defined spatial and temporal
            boundaries must, at a minimum, include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>existing projects and activities;</li>
            <li>
              those physical facilities or activities for which formal plans or
              applications have been made or are likely to occur; and
            </li>
            <li>
              other related project or activity development assumptions that
              support and are consistent with the long term economic or
              financial assumptions (Chapter&nbsp;7) and engineering assumptions
              (Chapter&nbsp;4) made in the application, even if formal plans or
              applications have not yet been made.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Courts have said that the decisions of responsible authorities
            are not required to &ldquo;consider fanciful projects by imagined
            parties producing purely hypothetical effects&rdquo;<sup id="fn3-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"
                ><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a
              ></sup
            >. However, the NEB does have discretion to consider future
            development scenarios if it is reasonable to anticipate that the
            applied for project could contribute to the potential cumulative
            effects resulting from such future development (i.e. if the economic
            feasibility of the applied for project is contingent upon the future
            development). The extent to which an applicant must consider the
            effects associated with other future physical facilities and
            activities and the associated depth of analysis will depend upon the
            relative contribution of the applied for project to the predicted
            cumulative effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where intensive or expansive development of the region is occurring
            or anticipated, details regarding the flexibility of
            project-specific mitigation and monitoring strategies become
            particularly important and should also be provided with the
            application to demonstrate the ability of the applicant to adapt its
            plans in the future should the resulting cumulative effects differ
            from those predicted (further Filing Requirements and Guidance for
            project related monitoring are provided in Subsection&nbsp;6.8
            below).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board recognizes that an applicant&rsquo;s depth of analysis in
            assessing the effects associated with other future physical
            facilities and activities will depend on the feasibility and
            practicality of assessing those effects. For example, future effects
            associated with projects not within the direct control of the
            applicant and for which there is limited information, or which are
            still in early planning stages, are inherently more challenging to
            assess. Despite this, an applicant should use the best available
            information or undertake additional work to assess these potential
            effects. Any uncertainties associated with the information used and
            any assumptions or limitations associated with the analysis must be
            explained.

          <h4>Guidance -&nbsp;Mitigation Measures for Cumulative Effects</h4>
          <p>
            Mitigation of cumulative effects may include broader-scale planning
            measures or initiatives to reduce interactions and effects from
            multiple projects or activities. Potentially effective mitigation of
            cumulative effects may not be within the direct control of, or
            undertaken by, the applicant. For example, operators may have
            cooperation plans in place to prevent simultaneous occurrence of
            activities or projects, or multiple operators may cooperatively make
            use of existing disturbed areas to prevent new disturbances.
            Further, regional-level multi-stakeholder planning initiatives may
            also be evaluated as a means to mitigate cumulative effects. Where
            such measures or initiatives are in place, an applicant should
            clearly explain why the identified mitigation would be appropriate
            to mitigate any cumulative effects. If the mitigation is not within
            the direct control of the applicant, it should state who would
            implement the mitigation and how that responsible party intends to
            monitor implementation of the mitigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Various forms of compensation (e.g. habitat offsets) should also be
            considered as part of an applicant&rsquo;s proposed mitigation, as
            appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If monitoring or research programs are identified as a means to
            adaptively manage cumulative effects, the applicant should
            explicitly identify how those programs will be used to avoid or
            reduce effects (i.e., which management actions will be triggered
            when certain ecological or socio-economic effects are identified, or
            thresholds reached).

            effects versus cumulative effects is the consideration of other
            physical facilities and activities. The evaluation of significance

            reporting can vary, but typically ranges from one to five years
            following the commencement of project operations. Projects requiring
            a longer period of time to reach reclamation goals (e.g., work in
            areas difficult to revegetate, such as native prairie) or requiring
            an in-depth, element-specific program may be required to submit

                  may be appropriate to define a more suitable or specific
                  element or valued component. For example, where there is a
                  risk of soil contamination reaching groundwater, then
                  &ldquo;groundwater contamination&rdquo; might be an
                  appropriate element to assess. This could more accurately
                  focus on the issue of concern, avoid repeating information
                  under both soils and water categories, and provide a more
                  focused assessment.

                  Ensure spatial boundaries for the study area and assessment
                  are specific to the valued component and ecologically
                  defensible (e.g., winter range boundaries, migration routes,

                <p>
                  When calculating the disturbance footprint or linear
                  disturbance density, remember to include the total avoidance
                  area experienced by the valued component, which may be
                  considerably larger than the physical footprint itself

                  Temporal considerations are also relevant. For example,
                  effects on wildlife from noise and sensory disturbance, water
                  usage or divergence, or waste stream emissions to air, land or
                  water can be exacerbated by having a number of projects taking
                  place simultaneously (or continuously over more than one
                  season) in a watershed, breeding area or migratory pathway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Increased access to project areas, whether temporary or
                  permanent, affects wildlife habitat, populations, distribution
                  and interactions. Access may include not only human access but
                  increased ease of access by predators or competing species.

                  Examples of tools that may be used to assess cumulative
                  effects on valued components include scenario-based models,
                  spatial analysis using a geographic information system, and
                  landscape level indicators of change (e.g., linear density)

                  Many rare species (e.g., endangered or threatened species
                  under the SARA) are at risk in large part as a result of the
                  past cumulative effects on their population or habitat. Their
                  inclusion on official lists reflects their status as having
                  crossed a threshold requiring special actions for their
                  protection and recovery. Any additional residual effects have
                  the potential to further contribute to this existing
                  situation. Consequently, proposed projects must preferably
                  avoid, or fully mitigate or compensate for any residual
                  project contribution to cumulative effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Status refers to designation under federal, provincial or
                  territorial legislation or guidelines (e.g., extirpated,
                  endangered, threatened or of special concern).

                  Consult the SARA public registry for Schedule&nbsp;1, the List
                  of Wildlife Species at Risk, and Schedules&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3.
                  Consult with Environment and Climate Change Canada (Canadian
                  Wildlife Service), Fisheries and Oceans Canada, or Parks
                  Canada on Species at Risk or their critical habitat in the

                <p>
                  Where critical habitat has not been defined, field studies may
                  be necessary, as well as identifying, with federal, provincial
                  or territorial authorities, mitigation measures that
                  effectively avoid sensitive interaction periods or activities.
                  Field surveys may be useful in identifying mitigation needs or
                  locally common populations not substantially affected.

                <p>
                  For species at risk listed on Schedule&nbsp;1 of SARA, the
                  proposed mitigative measures must be consistent with any
                  applicable Recovery Strategies and Action Plans listed on the
                  SARA public registry.
                </p>

                  Consult with appropriate provincial or territorial authorities

                <p>
                  For species at risk with no recovery strategy or action plan,
                  applicants should use the best available information, such as
                  COSEWIC status reports, draft recovery strategies or action
                  plans, existing plans or input from the recovery team and
                  specific advice (or management plans) from any jurisdiction
                  that manages the species. Describe how measures to avoid,
                  fully mitigate or compensate project effects would align with
                  the best available information. When relying on compensation
                  plans, describe the details of consultation with relevant
                  experts, the options available, and criteria for selecting the
                  options relied on, and for assessing the adequacy (sufficiency
                  and validity) of any compensation measures or offsets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Applicants should conduct a thorough inventory of all areas
                  potentially affected by the project that are expected to
                  support any species at risk or species of special status.
                  Consult federal, provincial, territorial, regional and local
                  databases (e.g., conservation data centres) and any other
                  information associated with species of special status. Species
                  data in existing databases may not be systematically collected
                  or updated and, therefore, a database search may not be
                  sufficient to support a conclusion about the absence of a
                  species in the area.

                  An assessment of impacts on current use of lands and resources
                  for traditional purposes by Aboriginal people is required for

                  Aboriginal people may use lands for various traditional
                  activities such as hunting, fishing, trapping, berry picking,
                  and plant gathering, for medicinal, cultural or household use,

                  In assessing the temporal aspects of traditional land and
                  resource use, note the frequency, duration and seasonal
                  aspects of each activity. In assessing the spatial aspects of
                  traditional land and resource use, note that some activities
                  could be site specific (e.g., berry-picking areas) but others
                  may not (e.g., hunting may extend over a broad area and
                  temporal considerations may be more relevant).

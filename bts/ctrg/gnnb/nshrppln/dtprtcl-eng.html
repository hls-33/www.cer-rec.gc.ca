<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Companies are responsible for meeting the requirements of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CER Act) and related regulations in order to manage safety and security, and protect the environment during the entire lifecycle of their facilities, from design through construction, operation and abandonment.</p>
<p>The Canada Energy Regulator (Commission) expects that pipeline companies operate in a systematic, comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Commission expects that companies have effective, fully developed and implemented management systems and protection programs that provide for continual improvement. A carefully-designed and well-implemented management system supports a strong culture of safety, and is fundamental to keeping people safe and protecting the environment.</p>
<p>As required by the Canada Energy Regulator Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR), companies must establish, implement and maintain effective management systems and protection programs in order to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions that may adversely affect the safety and security of the company’s pipelines, employees, the general public, as well as property and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Canada Energy Regulator Management System and Protection Program Audit Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The Commission utilizes a number of methods for assessing compliance with its regulatory requirements which include audits of company management systems, and protection programs for safety, environment, integrity, pipeline crossings and public awareness, emergency management and security.</p>
<p>Companies will be audited and evaluated against the legal requirements within the CER Act and its associated regulations, other applicable legislation and standards including the Canada Labour Code and CSA&nbsp;Z662, as well as any conditions contained within applicable Commission certificates or orders enforced by the Commission (collectively, Legal Requirements).</p>
<p>As part of this audit process and in accordance with the OPR, companies will be audited and evaluated against the processes, procedures and standards that each company identifies as being part of its management system and protection programs.</p>
<p>The Commission uses its standardized audit protocol to assist in both organizing and communicating its management system and protection program requirements, and in verifying that a company’s management system and protection programs meet Legal Requirements. This protocol is made available to companies and the public to promote transparency and understanding of the Commission’s audit process.</p>
<p>The standardized audit protocol has been organized in a table format for ease of reference. The table has been divided into five categorical elements. These elements are further divided into 17&nbsp;sub-elements, which are supported with the Commission’s expectations and associated legal references. The Legal Requirements referred to in the standardized audit protocol are not exhaustive, and do not reflect all of the Legal Requirements audited to.</p>
<p>The total complement of applicable Legal Requirements audited to ultimately varies depending on  the specific processes, activities, locations and certificate requirements of the company being audited, and are generally communicated to an audited company over the course of the audit as the Commission implements its audit process.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong></p>
<p>Following the Commission’s review of the company’s management system and protection programs, the Commission will issue an audit report containing its findings of compliance and non-compliance. For evaluation and reporting purposes, the terms of compliant and non-compliant are defined as follows:</p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<dl>
<dt>Compliant:</dt>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg"><dd>The element meets Legal Requirements. The company has demonstrated that it has developed and implemented its management system and protection programs, processes and procedures to meet Legal Requirements.</dd></div>
<dt>Non-Compliant:</dt>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg"><dd>The element does not meet Legal Requirements. The company has not demonstrated that it has developed and implemented its management system and protection programs, process and procedures to meet the Legal Requirements. A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is required.</dd></div>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Following the Commission’s issuance of the audit report, an audited company will be required to develop and implement a CAP to address any non-compliance. The CAP will be submitted for the Commission’s approval prior to its implementation.</p>
<p>A company’s CAP is required to clearly describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compliance objectives and outcomes with documented measures for success;</li>
<li>Plans for developing and implementing any needed changes to programs, procedures and practices, including changes to training and competency requirements; and</li>
<li>Schedules of implementation, including any key interim implementation dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedules for implementation must be based on risk, with high and/or imminent risk issues being addressed as quickly as practicable.</p>
<p>Companies that do not effectively implement Commission-approved CAPs will be subject to the Commission’s compliance assurance processes and enforcement tools including administrative monetary penalties, as applicable.</p>
<p>A description of the Commission’s audit process including pre- and post-audit administrative requirements will be provided to companies during the audit notification and planning process.</p>

            The National Energy Board (the Board) has issued the attached
            Information Advisory regarding the updated OPR and PPR guidance and
            FM requirements on decommissioning activities and applications. The
            Board expects that this Information Advisory is given wide
            circulation to all relevant personnel within your organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions concerning the guidance requirements,
            please contact Kurt McAllister, Director, at 403-292-4800.

            <strong
              >Updates to OPR and PPR Decommissioning Guidance Notes<br />
              and New Decommissioning Filing Manual Requirements</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Purpose</strong><br />
            To clarify decommissioning activities and applications, the Board
            has updated the <em>Filing Manual</em> by the addition of specific
            requirements for decommissioning applications and amended the
            guidance notes on decommissioning in the OPR and PPR. The Board has
            additionally included a reference under the abandonment requirements
            section directing companies to review the engineering activities
            located under the decommissioning requirements before submitting an
            abandonment application so as to confirm that all engineering
            activities have been met by the abandonment stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Expectations</strong><br />
            The amendments only clarify an existing process. There are no
            related amendments to the OPR or PPR or additional consequential
            amendments to the<em> Filing Manual</em> or any other related
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>

              >GOAL (s.&nbsp;45.1): To ensure that decommissioning of a
              pipeline, or part of a pipeline, is carried out in a safe,
              efficient, and environmentally responsible manner that respects
              the rights of those affected.</strong

          <p>
            Decommissioning may be required when a company ceases operation of a
            pipeline or part of one, but the same level of service continues as
            a result of other lines in the system (e.g. looped lines within a
            common right-of-way). Service is defined as the ability of a
            pipeline, as a whole, to transport hydrocarbons to an end point. For
            example, if a company ceases operation of one line in a series of
            looped lines (collectively the pipeline) and it is no longer being
            used to transport hydrocarbons, this would often be considered a
            decommissioning because, as a whole, the other lines are still able
            to transport hydrocarbons and provide the same level of service. The
            Board acknowledges, however, that decommissioning relief may be
            appropriate in other contexts. Other examples of decommissioning
            could include, but would not be limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If Pipeline ‘A’ in a right of way corridor ceases operation
              without a discontinuance of service, and there are other pipelines
              (either one or more companies and/or one or more jurisdictions) in
              the same corridor, Pipeline ‘A’ may need to remain in a
              decommissioned state, so as not to impact the remaining operating
              pipelines until all are ready for abandonment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Within a company’s facilities (e.g., meter stations, pump
              stations, terminals, etc), there may be a need to cease operation
              of a portion of a particular facility, without discontinuance of
              service, until the entire facility can be abandoned in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              There may be a need to relocate a pipeline or facility to
              accommodate a public work project (e.g. roads, electrical
              facilities, etc.).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All decommissioned pipelines will require an application to the
            Board for abandonment when the circumstances allow for the physical
            activities related to abandonment. The Board expects that companies
            will continue to monitor decommissioned pipelines and consult with
            affected parties during the decommissioning period. A public hearing
            must be held for abandonment applications. The Board has authority
            to hold a hearing for a decommissioning application if it considers
            it advisable to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The requirement for companies to seek approval to decommission
            facilities allows the Board to assess the socio-economic,
            environmental and financial effects of the proposed projects and in
            order to promote to the fullest extent, the safe operation of other
            pipelines or facilities that continue to operate nearby. If
            40&nbsp;km or more of pipe will be removed from the ground, a
            decommissioning application will require an environmental assessment
            under the <em>Canadian Environment Assessment Act, 2012</em>.

            Decommissioning is intended to capture the permanent cessation of
            operation of a processing plant or part of one that does not result
            in a discontinuance of service.

            The requirement for companies to seek approval to decommission
            facilities would allow the Board to examine the application to
            promote to the fullest extent the continued safe operation of the
            processing plant and assess the socio-economic, environmental and
            financial effects of the proposed projects and promote to the
            fullest extent, the safe operation of facilities that continue to

          <p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
          <p>
            Schedule A is to be used to determine whether a project under the
            Act is subject to Exemption Order XG-XO-100-2008 (the Order), in
            which case, an application to the Board is not required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Copies of Schedule A are not required to be physically completed,
            filed, or retained for those projects undertaken pursuant to the
            Order. However, companies and persons may be required, either upon
            request of the Board or during a Board audit, to demonstrate that
            projects undertaken pursuant to the Order were properly subject to
            this Order.
          </p>
          <p>
            In determining whether a project under the Act is subject to
            Exemption Order XG-XO-100-2008, companies shall ensure that the
            project is within the list of eligible projects listed in
            Step&nbsp;1.
          </p>
          <p>It is important to note the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Order only applies to projects related to the decommissioning
              of an existing oil or gas pipeline or processing plant for which a
              Board certificate or order is in place or which was exempt from
              the requirements of filing under the Operations and Maintenance
              Activities on Pipelines Regulated Under the
              <em>National Energy Board Act</em> or the section&nbsp;58
              Streamlining Order and does not apply to commodity pipelines or
              those pipelines transporting sulphur or sulphur compounds beyond
              the property limits of a gas plant for sale or disposal;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Projects which are captured under the Order may also be subject to
              other regulatory requirements which are not within the purview of
              the Board and it is incumbent upon the applicant to be aware of
              and comply with these requirements; and
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For projects listed in Step&nbsp;1, the Order applies only if the
              project(s) required meet <strong>ALL</strong> of the criteria set
              out in Steps&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3 of Schedule&nbsp;A.

17&nbsp;July 2015</p>
<p><strong>To: All Oil and Gas Companies under the Jurisdiction of the National Energy Board (Board) and Interested Persons</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operations and Maintenance Activities on Pipelines under the <em>National Energy Board Act</em></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this letter is to inform you of important updates related to <em>Operations and Maintenance Activities on Pipelines Regulated under the National Energy Board Act: Requirements and Guidance Notes</em> (O&amp;M Guidelines).</p>
<p><strong>Effective 17&nbsp;August 2015, companies are directed to file O&amp;M Notifications through the Online Event Reporting System (OERS).</strong> This replaces the requirement for companies to file documents electronically through the Board’s electronic repository. Companies will no longer be required to file a hard copy of the notification. Information on how to use the OERS can be found in <a href="/pplctnflng/sbmt/vntrprtngsrgd/vntrprtngsrgd-eng.html">Appendix&nbsp;B</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to filing an O&amp;M Notification, companies should review the O&amp;M Guidelines to ensure all required information is provided, as set-out in <a href="#nnxa">Appendix&nbsp;A</a> of this letter. Companies are reminded they must still fulfill their regulatory obligations to other federal, territorial and provincial agencies for O&amp;M activities. Additional information pertaining to the Board’s responsibilities as they relate to fish and fish habitat and navigation for notifications of O&amp;M activities can also be found in the O&amp;M Guidelines.</p>
<p>For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Meghan&nbsp;Ruholl, Director, Audit, Compliance Support and Enforcement (403-299-2795 or 1-800-899-1265).</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>

<h2>O&amp;M Guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="s1" class="list-unstyled ">1.0 Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of the <em>Operations and Maintenance Activities on Pipelines Regulated Under the National Energy Board Act: Requirements and Guidance Notes</em> (O&amp;M Guidelines) is to provide all parties with greater clarity about how operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) activities on pipelines (including processing plants) under the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) will be regulated, while promoting safety, security, environmental protection, economic efficiency, and respect for the rights of those that may be affected.</p>
<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h3 id="s2" class="list-unstyled ">2.0 Background</h3>
<p>Routine O&amp;M activities are evaluated by the National Energy Board (Board) as part of the original application for the construction and operation of a pipeline<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>; therefore, companies are not required to apply for additional approval to undertake most O&amp;M activities. The Board continues to regulate O&amp;M activities and to fulfill its mandate through its inspection and audit programs.</p>
<p> The requirements for O&amp;M activities contained in this document apply to all pipelines regulated under the NEB Act that occur on lands owned by the applicant company or where there is an agreement in place between the company and the landowner(s) that covers the construction, operation and maintenance of a pipeline, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>company-owned land;</li>
<li>land rights held under easement, leased, or licensed land; and</li>
<li>temporary workspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where permanent new lands are required to carry out O&amp;M activities companies are reminded that they must fulfill the requirements of sections&nbsp;86 and&nbsp;87 of the NEB Act.</p>

<h3 id="s3" class="list-unstyled ">3.0 Definitions</h3>
<h4 id="s3_1"><em>3.1 Eligible Activities</em></h4>
<p>Operations and maintenance activities include:</p>
<ol>
<li>all activities necessary to safely operate an existing pipeline;</li>
<li>maintenance activities, upgrades or repairs to an existing pipeline or part of a pipeline that do not increase the approved maximum operating pressure (MOP), the stress level<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> or diameter of the pipeline; or</li>
<li>physically removing an existing section of pipe up to 5&nbsp;km in length, and putting a new section of pipe in its place, as long as this replacement does not increase the approved maximum operating pressure (MOP), stress level or diameter of the pipeline.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="s3_2"><em>3.2 Restrictions on Eligible Activities</em></h4>
<p>Where any of the following restrictions exist, the company must apply to the Board in accordance with the NEB Act and the related Regulations and <strong><em>may not carry out the proposed activity until approval from the Board has been obtained</em></strong>. The restrictions apply where:</p>
<ol>
<li>the work includes welding on an in-service pipeline by a pipeline company that has not previously performed in-service welding in accordance with the requirements of CSA&nbsp;Z662-15, Clause&nbsp;7.17, ‘Welding on In-Service Piping’, or the equivalent clause in the most recent edition of CSA&nbsp;Z662; or</li>
<li>the work involves the construction of an aerial crossing, excluding work on company owned or leased land relating to facilities (e.g.,&nbsp;terminal stations, processing plants, compressor/pump stations).</li>
</ol>
<p>Subject to <a href="#s3_3">section&nbsp;3.3</a>, O&amp;M activities that fall within the types of activities listed in 3.1 above, and to which none of the restrictions in 3.2 apply, do not require an application to the Board under the NEB Act. Companies will be required to notify the Board prior to undertaking the O&amp;M activities. (See <a href="#scha">Schedule&nbsp;A</a> and <a href="#s4_1">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>).</p>
<h4 id="s3_3"><em>3.3 Ineligible Activities</em></h4>
<p>O&amp;M activities <strong>do <em>not</em> include</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>upgrades that result in increases above previously approved and specified levels to:
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
<li>the MOP,</li>
<li>stress levels,</li>
<li>the diameter of the pipeline, and/or</li>
<li>airborne emissions or noise levels<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn3"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>&quot;looping&quot; (i.e.,&nbsp;adding pipe parallel or adjacent to, and interconnected with, an existing pipeline for the general purpose of increasing capacity);</li>
<li>construction of a new pipeline; or</li>
<li>deactivation (for longer than 12&nbsp;months), reactivation (where a pipeline has been deactivated for more than 12&nbsp;months), decommissioning, or abandonment.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>All of the preceding activities require an application under the NEB Act, the <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999</em> (OPR) or the <em>National Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations</em> (PPR)</strong> (see <a href="#scha">Schedule&nbsp;A</a>).</p>
<div class="col-md-12  brdr-tp brdr-rght brdr-bttm brdr-lft  well well-sm ">
<p><strong>Guidance Notes:</strong></p>
<p>O&amp;M activities <strong><em>do not include</em></strong> the addition of a parallel piece of pipe without removal of the existing pipe that has em ceased operation. If the company plans to leave an existing section of pipe in place, it must apply to the Board: (i) for an exemption under section&nbsp;58 of the NEB Act, for the construction and operation of the new section of pipeline; and (ii) to decommission the existing section of pipe under the OPR.</p>
<p>Companies are required to apply to the Board for the installation of any length of pipe that is greater than 5&nbsp;km.</p>
<p>In general, permissible &quot;upgrades&quot; <strong><em>do not include</em></strong> additions of components to a pipeline or processing facility that were not specifically contemplated in the original Certificate or Order. However, the definition of upgrade includes the addition of cathodic protection systems, as these are typically contemplated during the assessment of the original pipeline. Therefore, the addition of a cathodic protection system is considered an O&amp;M activity.</p>
<p>Upgrades include improvements in technology. For example, if a company were proposing to install solar panels as a power source in place of an existing source of fuel oil, the proposed installation would be considered a permissible upgrade under the O&amp;M Guidelines. This is analogous to removing an existing section of pipe and putting a new section in its place, since the function of the installation would not change from what was originally approved.</p>
<p>Upgrades do <em>not</em> include adding new connections, including tie-ins or hot taps, and associated piping and metering facilities for the purposes of sale or receipt of oil or gas. These installations still require an exemption Order under section&nbsp;58 of the NEB Act but may be captured within the section&nbsp;58 Streamlining Order. Metering or regulating facilities installed for the sole purposes of measurement or monitoring are considered O&amp;M activities.</p>
<p>Companies are encouraged to contact the Board for additional clarification related to specific O&amp;M activities they are planning (see <a href="#s7">Section&nbsp;7.0</a> for contact information).</p>

<h3 id="s4" class="list-unstyled ">4.0 Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="s4_1"><em>4.1. Notification to the National Energy Board</em></h4>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p> The Board is provided with sufficient information to make a decision as to whether to inspect O&amp;M activities that could result in safety consequences to landowners or the public, environmental consequences, or a negative impact on normal third-party use of the right-of-way (RoW) or adjacent property.</p>
<p><strong> Requirements:</strong></p>
<p> In any of the following circumstances, the Board requires companies to provide <strong>notification</strong> to the Board of O&amp;M activities at least&nbsp;<strong>21 working&nbsp;days</strong><sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn4"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> prior to starting work:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are unresolved 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party concerns (i.e., landowners, Aboriginal groups, shippers, federal and provincial departments, or other parties who may be affected by the O&amp;M activities) and these concerns relate specifically to the proposed O&amp;M activity<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn5"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>;</li>
<li>new permanent land must be acquired in accordance with NEB Act sections&nbsp;86 and&nbsp;87;</li>
<li>exposure of the pipe surface for the purposes of integrity assessments, repairs or removing an existing section of pipe and putting a new section in its place in areas where there are residences, or where there is a school, hospital, prison, or other institution where people routinely congregate in large groups (more than 50&nbsp;people), within the emergency planning zone or within 200&nbsp;m of the proposed activity (whichever is greater);</li>
<li>removing an existing section of pipe and putting a new section in its place where the replacement is greater than 100&nbsp;m (but less than 5&nbsp;km) in length;</li>
<li>pressure testing of line pipe performed by means other than hydrostatic testing<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn6"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>; and<br>
</li>
<li>ground disturbance using power-operated equipment within 30&nbsp;m of a wetland<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn7"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> or a water body<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn8"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>, or within 30&nbsp;m of the substrate of a wetland or water body<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn9"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any of the above-noted circumstances, companies are required to submit the following information when notifying the Board:</p>
<ul>
<li>a description of the planned activity or project;</li>
<li>a rationale for the activity or project;</li>
<li>the location of the activity (e.g.,&nbsp;legal land description, kilometre post);</li>
<li>where applicable, the location of any residences, or schools, hospitals, prisons, or other institution where people routinely congregate in large groups (more than 50&nbsp;people), within the emergency planning zone or within 200&nbsp;m of the proposed activity (whichever is greater);</li>
<li>timing and duration of the activity (e.g.,&nbsp;day, week, month);</li>
<li>reference to applicable section(s) of relevant company manuals or environmental protection plan;</li>
<li>a contact person with the company, with whom the Board could follow-up;</li>
<li>regarding consultation:
<ul>
<li>where there are no unresolved 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party concerns related specifically to the O&amp;M activity, a <strong><em>summary</em></strong> or overview of consultation that has been undertaken with potentially affected 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;parties; or justification why consultation was not carried out; and</li>
<li>where there are remaining unresolved 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party concerns related specifically to the O&amp;M activity, a <strong><em>complete record</em></strong> or table of consultation that has been undertaken with those parties; or justification why consultation was not carried out; and</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>where new permanent land is to be acquired for an O&amp;M activity:
<ul>
<li>whether fee simple landowner is in agreement (if private land);</li>
<li>confirmation that company will comply with the requirements under sections&nbsp;86 and&nbsp;87 of the NEB Act; and</li>
<li>the amount of new permanent land to be acquired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="col-md-12  brdr-tp brdr-rght brdr-bttm brdr-lft  well well-sm ">
<p><strong>Guidance Notes:</strong></p>
<p>For notification, the Board requires sufficient information to understand the nature and scope of the O&amp;M activities. The information required for notification to the Board should be concise, but it should provide the Board with sufficient detail to determine whether Board follow-up is warranted. With respect to Board inspections of O&amp;M activities, the Board will rely on the information outlined in the company’s O&amp;M Manual, its Environmental Protection Program, and information resulting from public consultation activities when verifying compliance of O&amp;M activities.</p>
<p>Companies are required to file notifications using the Online Event Reporting System (OERS) at <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/ers">https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/ers</a>. Further guidance on how to use the OERS can be found on the website at <a href="/index.html">www.neb-one.gc.ca</a>, under Operations and Maintenance Activities.</p>
<p><a href="#s8">Section 8.0</a> outlines the additional information that the Board requires companies to provide with their notification of O&amp;M activities involving ground disturbance using power-operated equipment within 30&nbsp;m of a wetland or a water body, or within 30&nbsp;m of a substrate of a wetland or water body, made pursuant to these guidelines. Further details of the requirements can also be found in the OERS user guide.</p>

<h4 id="s4_2"><em>4.2. Unplanned Operations and Maintenance Activities</em></h4>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p> Companies undertake all O&amp;M activities that are required to safely operate a pipeline and to protect the environment.</p>
<p><strong> Requirement:</strong></p>
<p> For O&amp;M activities that are unplanned (i.e.,&nbsp;the company only becomes aware these activities are necessary shortly before starting the work), but which would normally require advance notification (see list of activities requiring notification in <a href="#s4_1">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>), companies are required to notify the Board as soon as they determine the activity must be carried out, following the same notification process outlined in <a href="#s4_1">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered"><caption class="wb-inv collapse ">Guidance Notes</caption>
<tr>
<td> <p><strong>Guidance Notes:</strong></p>
<p> Notifying the Board of unplanned O&amp;M activities does not substitute for a company's obligation to report incidents under the OPR, PPR, the <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Crossing Regulations</em>, the <em>Transportation Safety Board Act,</em> the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>, and/or under other relevant legislation. Such reporting is also required.</p></td>

<h4 id="s4_3"><em>4.3. Public Consultation</em></h4>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p> Companies conduct effective public consultation related to O&amp;M activities.</p>
<p><strong> Requirements:</strong></p>
<p> The Board requires companies to engage parties whose rights or interests may be affected by O&amp;M, prior to undertaking those activities. Companies must document all consultation activities and maintain documentation and must provide this documentation as outlined in <a href="#s4_1">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>, or upon request from the Board.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered"><caption class="wb-inv collapse ">Guidance Notes</caption>
<tr>
<td> <p><strong>Guidance Notes:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Public consultation&quot; refers to the range of activities a company can undertake to share information with members of the public who may be affected by O&amp;M activities, and to identify and resolve issues or concerns related to these activities. Examples of potentially-affected members of the public include landowners, tenants, residents, Aboriginal communities, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, trappers, guides, outfitters, recreational users, other land or resource users (e.g.,&nbsp;forestry, mining), and commercial third parties.</p>
<p>The Board recognizes that effective public consultation goes beyond simply informing potentially-affected members of the public, and includes involving them in decisions or plans that may affect their lives. Companies must carry out public consultation activities that are reasonable for the scope and nature of the planned activity, and must justify the extent of public consultation carried out, particularly if no consultation is undertaken.</p>
<p> Although not an exhaustive list, the following sources provide companies with guidance on effective public consultation, which should be considered when planning O&amp;M activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Board’s <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/flngmnl/fmch3-eng.html"><em>Filing Manual</em>, Chapter&nbsp;3</a></li>
<li>CSA&nbsp;Z764-96, <em>A Guide to Public Involvement</em></li>
<li>Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), <em>Guide for Effective Public Involvement</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.iap2.org" title="International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) website" rel="external">International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Board expects companies to maintain records of public consultation activities related to O&amp;M activities. At a minimum, the Board expects companies to document and retain the following information related to public consultation activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who was involved?</li>
<li>When did public consultation occur and what methods were used?</li>
<li>What issues were raised?</li>
<li>How were the issues addressed?</li>
<li>What issues were not resolved?</li>
<li>What follow-up was undertaken or is planned to address unresolved issues?</li>
</ul>
<p>When consultation includes Aboriginal communities, companies should consider establishing a consultation protocol with these communities that takes into consideration their rights, interests, and cultural elements.</p></td>

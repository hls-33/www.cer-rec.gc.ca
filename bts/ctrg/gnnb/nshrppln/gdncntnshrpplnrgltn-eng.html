<h1 id="wb-cont" property="name">Guidance Notes for the <em>National Energy Board Act Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em></h1>
<p>4&nbsp;September 2013<br>
Sections&nbsp;47.2 and 55, and Annex&nbsp;A &ndash; updated 7&nbsp;October 2016<br>
Section&nbsp;42 &ndash; updated 15&nbsp;November 2018</p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>GUIDANCE NOTES FOR THE<br>
<br>
<em>NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD ACT ONSHORE PIPELINE REGULATIONS</em></strong></p>
<p id="intro"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-99-294/index.html" rel="external"><em>National Energy Board Act Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em></a> (OPR) provide regulatory requirements for oil and gas companies under the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act).</p>
<p>These Guidance Notes are provided to assist interested parties in understanding the requirements of the OPR. These Guidance Notes are not a substitute for the NEB Act or any regulations made thereunder including the OPR, or any other applicable legislation or standards enforced by the Canada Energy Regulator (NEB or Board) or which the Board audits companies against. To achieve or evaluate compliance with the OPR, reference should be made to the OPR itself, and reliance should not be placed on these Guidance Notes. To the extent there is any inconsistency between these Guidance Notes and the NEB Act or its regulations, or any other applicable legislation or standards, the legislation and standards are paramount.</p>
<p>The Board’s compliance activities include conducting compliance assessment meetings, inspections and audits to review a company’s compliance with the NEB Act and related regulations. The NEB’s <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/nshrppln/dtprtcl-eng.html">Audit Protocol</a> is provided in a separate document and outlines the framework for compliance assessment in an NEB audit.</p>
<p>The NEB’s <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/flngmnl/index-eng.html"><em>Filing Manual</em></a> contains filing requirements for OPR requirements involving applications that require NEB authorization.</p>
<p>The NEB expects pipeline companies to approach operating in a systematic, comprehensive and proactive manner that manages risks. The Board also expects that companies have fully developed and implemented management systems and protection programs that provide for continual improvement. A carefully-designed and well-implemented management system supports a strong culture of safety and is fundamental to keeping people safe and protecting the environment.</p>
<p>As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and maintain management systems and protection programs in order to anticipate, prevent, manage and mitigate conditions that may adversely affect the safety and security of the company’s pipelines, employees, the public, as well as property and the environment. A company’s management system applies to the company’s programs for safety, pipeline integrity, environmental protection, emergency management and security.</p>
<p>When requested by the Board, companies must demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of the management processes and procedures employed.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>GOAL (Section&nbsp;1): Provide definitions for terms used in the OPR.</strong></p>
<p>Section&nbsp;48 of the NEB Act provides the Board with the authority to make regulations (subject to the approval of the Governor in Council) governing the design, construction, operation and abandonment of a pipeline and providing for the protection of property and the environment and the safety and security of the public and of the company's employees in the construction, operation and abandonment of a pipeline.</p>
<p>The definition of &quot;pipeline&quot; is provided at section&nbsp;2 of the NEB Act:</p>
<p>&quot;pipeline&quot; means a line that is used or to be used for the transmission of oil, gas or any other commodity and that connects a province with any other province or provinces or extends beyond the limits of a province or the offshore area as defined in section&nbsp;123, and includes all branches, extensions, tanks, reservoirs, storage facilities, pumps, racks, compressors, loading facilities, interstation systems of communication by telephone, telegraph or radio and real and personal property, or immovable and movable, and works connected to them, but does not include a sewer or water pipeline that is used or proposed to be used solely for municipal purposes.</p>
<p>The term &quot;onshore pipeline&quot; is specifically defined within the OPR to clarify that the OPR applies to pipelines intended for the transmission of hydrocarbons in onshore areas. Onshore areas are generally accepted to be pipelines installed on land above the ordinary high water mark of major water bodies.</p>
<p>Companies may consider reporting to the Board events having the potential to attract public and/or media attention or which have or may have significant adverse effects on property, the environment or the safety of persons regardless of whether or not they meet the strict definition of an &quot;incident&quot;. In addition, the Board has developed the following definition of a &quot;major bone&quot; to assist companies in complying with the reporting requirements set out in section&nbsp;52 of the OPR:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>&quot;major bone&quot;</strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">skull, mandible, spine, scapula, pelvis, femur, humerus, fibula, tibia, radius, and ulna.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For other fractured skeletal bones not listed, only those fractures that require an individual to undergo immediate corrective surgery are classified as a serious injury, hence a reportable incident.</p>
<p>In addition to the terms defined within section&nbsp;1 of the OPR, the terms &quot;audit&quot;, &quot;inspection&quot;, &quot;management system&quot;, &quot;program&quot;, &quot;process&quot;, procedure&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;, &quot;manual&quot;, and &quot;practice&quot; appear in the OPR and in this document. For clarity, these terms are generally understood to have the following meanings:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><em>audit</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">A systematic, documented verification process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence to determine whether specified activities, events, conditions, management systems or information about these matters conform with audit criteria and legal requirements, and communicating the results of the process to the company.</dd>
<dt><strong><em>inspection</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">An on-site and site-specific methodical examination and assessment of a company's construction, operation, or abandonment activities against its regulatory obligations, standards, acceptable industry practice, and the inspector's professional judgment. An inspection focuses on compliance requirements, usually pursuant to an approval condition or regulatory requirement, at an individual facility at a given point in time.</dd>
<dt><strong><em>management system</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">The system set out in sections&nbsp;6.1 to&nbsp;6.6 of the OPR. It is a systematic approach designed to effectively manage and reduce risk, and promote continual improvement. It includes the necessary organizational structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and procedures required for an organization to fulfill all tasks related to safety, security and environmental protection.</dd>
<dt><strong><em>manual</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">A document that contains a set of instructions on methods which are employed to accomplish a result. These instructions will be detailed and comprehensive. The document will be organized for ease of use.</dd>
<dt><strong><em>plan</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">A detailed, documented formulation for action to achieve an end.</dd> 
<dt><strong><em>practice</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">A repeated or customary action which is well understood by persons who are authorized to carry it out. Safe work practices are generally written methods outlining how to perform a task with minimum risk to people, equipment, materials, environment, and processes.</dd>
<dt><strong><em>procedure</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">A procedure indicates how a process will be implemented. It provides a documented series of steps followed in an established order. A procedure includes the identification of roles, responsibilities and authorities required for completing each step.</dd>
<dt><strong><em>process</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">A documented series of actions taking place in an established order, with identified roles and responsibilities, and directed toward a result. A process includes the roles, responsibilities and authorities for the actions. A process may contain a set of procedures, if required.</dd>
<dt><strong><em>program</em></strong></dt>
<dd class="mrgn-lft-lg">A documented set of processes and procedures designed to regularly accomplish a result. A program outlines how plans, processes and procedures are linked, and how each one contributes toward the result.

</div>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>GOAL (Sections&nbsp;6.1 &ndash; 6.4): A company has a management system and programs that enable it to meet its obligations for safety, security and protection of the environment.</strong></p>
<p>Through its management system, a company manages and reduces risk, and continually improves its operations. A carefully-designed and well-implemented management system supports a strong culture of safety and is fundamental to keeping people safe and protecting the environment.</p>
<p>Management systems provide a consistent framework for the design, development and implementation of protection programs, as well as for the cyclical planning, implementation, review and adjustment of operational activities which is essential for a company to effectively address risks, manage its resources appropriately and achieve desired outcomes. To meet the requirements of the OPR, management systems must be formally established and consistently implemented and managed.</p>
<p><strong>Management System (Section&nbsp;6.1)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive</strong>
<br>
<br>The OPR requires a management system to be systematic, explicit, comprehensive and proactive; this provides for continual improvement. A description of each of these components is provided below.<br>
<br>Systematic &ndash; A company’s management system is applied in a consistent manner throughout the organization, its sites, regions, business units, and any aspect of the organization.<br>
<br>Explicit &ndash; A company’s management system, and its policies and goals are documented and visible.<br>
<br>Comprehensive &ndash; A company’s management system addresses all aspects of a company’s business that may affect safety, security and protection of the environment. This includes areas beyond operational activities such as administrative and support functions, which may also impact safety, security and environmental outcomes (i.e.,&nbsp;finance, procurement, human resources).<br>
<br>Proactive &ndash; A company’s management system involves planning and foresight that emphasizes hazard identification and anticipation, and risk control and mitigation, before events that affect safety, security and environmental protection occur.</li>
<li><strong>Integrates operational and technical systems with management of resources</strong><br>
<br>A company integrates operational and technical systems with its management of human and financial resources to make sure it is able to achieve safety, security and environmental protection outcomes. This integration recognizes and effectively manages the relationship between traditionally technical issues (e.g.,&nbsp;materials selection or training and capacity) and financial or human resource management practices (e.g.,&nbsp;purchasing, procurement, recruitment and contracting), both of which may affect safety, security and environmental protection outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Applies to all of a company’s relevant activities and programs</strong><br>
<br>A company’s management system applies to the company’s programs for safety, security, integrity, environmental protection and emergency management. For programs to be systematic, comprehensive, explicit and proactive, they must include the requirements in section&nbsp;6.5. These include processes to identify hazards, manage risks, train and manage workers, communicate, manage records and documentation, monitor and evaluate progress and continually improve performance. A company’s management system and programs are based on the company’s policies and goals as well as the requirements of the OPR.<br>
<br>The company’s management system applies to all of the company’s activities involving the design, construction, operation or abandonment of a pipeline. For example, when a company plans and designs a pipeline, it uses its hazard assessment process to identify hazards to safety and the environment. The company also uses its risk management process to evaluate and manage risks, and develop the controls included in its proposed project. When a company constructs and operates its pipeline, it applies its management system through its safety management program, its environmental protection program, and the other management programs required by the OPR.</li>
<li><strong>Coordination between programs</strong><br>
<br>A company’s management system provides coordination between the company’s management and protection programs. For example, if a hazard is identified through the safety management program, that may also be a consideration in the environmental protection program, this information would be considered in the planning for both programs.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable, corresponding to the nature and scope of a company’s activities</strong><br>
<br>
Each company’s management system and its programs are based on its own situation and the activities it conducts, and should systematically address the hazards and risks that may affect it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accountable Officer Appointment and Notification (Section&nbsp;6.2)</strong></p>
<p>A company must appoint an accountable officer who has authority for the financial and human resources of the company required to meet its obligations for safety, security and protection of the environment.</p>
<p>The accountable officer is the person responsible on the company’s behalf for the company’s management system and related programs (safety, security, integrity, environmental protection and emergency management).</p>
<p>The accountable officer provides the focus, direction, influence and leadership, which is required to create a robust safety culture, and implement and continually improve a well-functioning management system within the organization. For example, the accountable officer communicates the company’s commitment to its policies and goals to the company’s employees. Corporate culture is driven by the top down and, as a result, engagement and commitment at the most senior level is required to effect change as needed.</p>
<p>The accountable officer is typically the person who holds the most senior position in the company. Based on a company's organizational structure, this person may hold the position of CEO, President, or some other designation. See the <a href="/index.html">NEB
website</a>), in the Guidance section of the OPR page, under <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/nshrppln/cmpnysbmssnrqrmnt-eng.html">Company Submission Requirements</a>, for a <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/nshrppln/ccntblffcrslctnprcss-eng.html">flowchart to assist companies with identifying their accountable officer</a>.</p>
<p>When a company has appointed an accountable officer, within 30&nbsp;days of the appointment, the company must notify the Board of the name of the person appointed. The OPR also requires the accountable officer to submit a signed statement to the Board accepting the responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/index.html">NEB website</a>, in the Guidance
section of the OPR page, under <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/nshrppln/cmpnysbmssnrqrmnt-eng.html">Company Submission Requirements</a>, for suggested template letters for (i)&nbsp;company notification to the NEB that it has appointed its accountable officer, and (ii)&nbsp;the signed statement from the accountable officer.</p>
<p>For further guidance on safety governance, see the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s paper entitled <em><a href="http://www.oecd.org/env/ehs/chemical-accidents/corporate%20governance%20for%20process%20safety-colour%20cover.pdf" rel="external">Corporate Governance for Process Safety, Guidance for Senior Leaders in High Hazard Industries</a></em> (June&nbsp;2012).</p>
<p><strong>Policies and Goals (Section&nbsp;6.3)</strong></p>
<p>A company’s commitment to safety, security and environmental protection is stated in its policies, and these policies are the foundation upon which an organization’s management system is based. A company’s goals reflect the direction and desired outcomes of the policies, and provide the basis for a company’s commitment to continual improvement through its management system.</p>
<p>In addition to typical high level goals of zero spills, ruptures, injuries and fatalities, the OPR requires that a company sets goals that contribute to the prevention of ruptures, liquid and gas releases, fatalities and injuries, and for the response to incidents and emergency situations.</p>
<p>A company is required to have a policy and a related process for the internal reporting of hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses. The policy must contain conditions where immunity will be granted for internal reporting of hazards, near misses and incidents.</p>
<p>This policy will enable employees to identify hazards and risks they may encounter during work activities, without fear of reprisal. The company’s internal process provides the steps to follow for internal reporting. With this process, the company tracks internal reporting through a data management system in order to continually improve safe operations and its safety culture.</p>
<p><strong>Documented organizational structure (Section&nbsp;6.4)</strong></p>
<p>In order to have a fully functioning management system, a company must have a documented organizational structure. Determination and communication of roles, responsibilities and governance structure are integral to a well-functioning management system. Up-to-date assessments of human resource needs, and appropriate allocation of human resources, are also critical for safety, security and environmental protection outcomes.</p>

</div>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>GOAL (Section&nbsp;17): The integrity of each welded joint is confirmed.</strong></p>
<p>This section applies only to welded steel joints.</p>
<p>The OPR requires that all pipeline joints be examined non-destructively. This includes butt welds, fillet welds, and branches.</p>
<p>Because the geometry of certain weld types makes inspection by radiography or ultrasonics impractical, the Board issued <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/nshrppln/mo082000-eng.pdf" title="Order&nbsp;MO-08-2000">Order&nbsp;MO-08-2000</a> on April&nbsp;28,&nbsp;2000. A copy of the Order is available on the <a href="/index.html">NEB
website</a>. The Order pertains to all federally regulated pipeline systems, and provides that another appropriate non-destructive examination method may be employed if a radiographic or ultrasonic method is not practicable in the particular circumstances. The Order also requires that companies document the methods used and the inspection results, and also clarifies that the use of a visual method as a means of non-destructive examination is not permitted under the terms of the Order.</p>
<p>Section&nbsp;17 and Order&nbsp;MO-08-2000 apply only to the joining of pipe and components performed after the manufacturing processes associated with fabrication of the pipe within the pipe mill and the fabrication of components within the manufacturer's facilities. As a matter of clarification, neither section&nbsp;17 nor Order&nbsp;MO-08-2000 of these regulatory instruments apply to the welded assembly of storage tanks forming part of the pipeline system.</p>
<p>Girth welds performed within pipe mills are not considered to be part of the manufacturing process (within the context of the &quot;joining&quot; definition in section&nbsp;1 of the OPR), and are therefore subject to the terms of the Order. The Board has issued case-specific exemptions from the 100% non-destructive examination requirement of section&nbsp;17 and Order&nbsp;MO-08-2000 pursuant to subsections&nbsp;48(2.1) and&nbsp;48(2.2) of the NEB Act. These exemptions have been for certain specific auxiliary piping systems associated with stations.</p>
<p>Variations from section&nbsp;17 and Order&nbsp;MO-08-2000 are permitted only in cases where a project-specific exemption order has been issued by the Board. A request for exemption from the terms of Order MO-08-2000 may include:</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, monitoring is defined as ongoing observations made on a regular basis to confirm that pipeline operation is within defined normal parameters. Surveillance may be defined as an aspect of monitoring, focused on certain parameters during periods of activity (construction, operation, and abandonment).</p>
<p>A monitoring program is aimed at the identification of any issues or potential concerns that may compromise the protection of the pipeline, property, persons and the environment (e.g.,&nbsp;pipeline integrity or erosion, security, etc.). It includes methods for developing measures to prevent or mitigate the impact of the identified issue(s). The program also provides for follow-up monitoring of sites where mitigative measures have been undertaken to determine their success or failure, a system for implementing additional mitigative measures as necessary and a feedback system that allows for adaptation of successful mitigation to future pipeline projects.</p>
<p>Surveillance is a component of the monitoring program that focuses on the frequency and methods of surveillance of the pipeline. This includes ensuring employees use approved safety procedures, contractors are adhering to the environmental requirements of a task, encroachments upon rights-of-way are detected, construction activities are known, etc.).</p>

The definition of &quot;pipeline&quot; in the NEB Act applies to the OPR and therefore this section applies to portions of the pipeline other than line pipe that are not being maintained for peak flow, standby (ready for immediate use), or emergency use. In practice, it is accepted that portions of pipeline, though maintained in a deactivated state, may never be returned to service, or may be maintained in a deactivated state for an unspecified length of time. Cathodic protection continues to be required for a deactivated pipeline. This status may ultimately be addressed in an application to abandon the operations of the pipeline.</p>
<p>Deactivation may impose a higher level of risk to the integrity of the pipeline depending on the measures specified for the maintenance of the deactivated pipe.</p>
<p>Deactivation of pipelines may impact upstream and downstream users of the pipeline. A company proposing deactivations could consider using a consultative approach with stakeholders similar to that which is used for applications made pursuant to section&nbsp;58 of the NEB Act.</p>

<p><strong>47</strong>. A company shall develop, implement and maintain a safety management program that anticipates, prevents, manages and mitigates potentially dangerous conditions and exposure to those conditions during all activities relating to construction, operation, maintenance, abandonment and emergency situations.</p>
</div>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>GOAL (Section&nbsp;47): Safety is achieved through the development, implementation and maintenance of a systematic safety management program.</strong></p>
<p>Safety management is an organizational function that strives to continually identify hazards and to assess and manage associated safety risks through a systematic approach that includes the necessary organizational structure, accountabilities, policies, and procedures, measures and monitoring, and continual improvement efforts. A safety management program identifies hazards and risks associated with operational activities in order for an organization to proactively reduce or eliminate unsafe conditions and activities by improving the related organizational influences such as the prescribed resources, processes, procedures and controls. Safety management programs are designed to address systemic safety vulnerabilities before they result in an active failure. They are also designed to capture changing conditions that introduce new hazards and risks.</p>
<p>A safety management program is focused on all hazards that have the potential to cause harm to the public, workers, and contractors. Safety management is designed to eliminate or reduce risk to the public, workers, the environment and assets. For this reason, there is a strong relationship between safety management and organizational programs related to security, emergency management and integrity.</p>
<p>A safety management program is based on the relevant policies and goals set by the company.</p>
<p>A company’s management system applies to the safety management program. In order for a safety management program to be systematic, comprehensive, explicit, and proactive, it must include the management system processes referenced at section&nbsp;6.5 of the OPR. This includes processes to identify hazards, manage risks, train and manage workers, communicate, manage records and documentation, monitor and evaluate progress and continually improve performance.</p>
<p>A company’s management system provides coordination between the safety management program, and the company’s programs for security, integrity, environmental protection, and emergency management.</p>
<p>For additional requirements concerning damage prevention for facilities, companies are directed to the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2016-124/index.html" rel="external"><em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations - Authorizations</em></a> and the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2016-133/index.html" rel="external"><em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em></a>, and the related NEB guidance document <em>Pipeline Damage Prevention &ndash; Ground Disturbance, Construction and Vehicle Crossing</em>.</p>
<p>The safety management program must meet the requirements of section&nbsp;4 of the OPR. The NEB is also responsible for verifying compliance with and enforcing Part&nbsp;II of the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>, which applies to the occupational safety and health of pipeline workers. A company’s safety management program must follow the compliance requirements of sections&nbsp;53 and&nbsp;55 of the OPR. This includes the requirement to conduct regular internal audits of the safety management program, with a maximum interval of three&nbsp;years.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>GOAL (Section&nbsp;47.1): Pipeline security is achieved through the development, implementation and maintenance of a systematic security management program.</strong></p>
<p>A company’s security management program is designed to identify hazards so that the risk of the facility or facilities is adequately and appropriately addressed and that the facility or facilities are being protected. When a company designs, constructs, operates or abandons a pipeline, or contracts for the provision of those services, the company must ensure that the pipeline is designed, constructed, operated or abandoned in accordance with the applicable provisions of CSA&nbsp;Z246.1.</p>
<p>CSA&nbsp;Z246.1 provides a framework to protect energy infrastructure from malicious damage through risk-based and performance-based management processes. A company’s security management program is based on factors such as type, size, location and criticality of the assets being protected. A company makes decisions based on their internal assessment of risk related to their facility. CSA&nbsp;Z246.1 was developed to be scalable, enabling it to be used by both small operators and large companies.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>GOAL (Section&nbsp;47.2): Safety of people and protection of the environment is achieved through the development, implementation and maintenance of a systematic damage prevention program.</strong></p>
<p>A company must proactively identify hazards and manage the related risks for its pipelines that may be introduced by ground disturbance activities, the construction of facilities near its pipelines, and vehicle crossings over its pipelines.</p>
<p>A company’s damage prevention program is developed to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate conditions that have the potential to adversely affect the safety of people who live and work around federally regulated facilities, thereby managing safety, security and environmental risks throughout the lifecycle of the pipeline.</p>
<p>A company’s damage prevention program must be based on the requirements found in both the OPR and the framework contained in the <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Authorizations</em> and the <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em>.</p>
<p>As part of its damage prevention program, a company is required to: have a public awareness program; monitor land use and land ownership changes near its pipeline(s); have processes for timely responses to locate requests and for managing requests for consent under the <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Authorizations</em>; and have standards for locating pipes. For details related to the damage prevention program requirements, see section&nbsp;16 of the <em>National Energy Board Pipeline Damage Prevention Regulations &ndash; Obligations of Pipeline Companies</em>.</p>
<p>A company’s damage prevention program is based on the relevant policies and goals set by the company as required by sections&nbsp;6.3 and 6.5 of OPR.</p>
<p>A company’s management system specifically applies to the damage prevention program. For a damage prevention program to be systematic, comprehensive, explicit and proactive, it must include the management system elements referenced at section&nbsp;6.5 of the OPR. This includes processes to identify and analyze hazards, evaluate and manage risks, train and manage workers, communicate with those who live and work around the pipeline, manage records and documentation, monitor and evaluate progress and continually improve performance.</p>
<p>A company’s management system provides coordination between the damage prevention program, and the company’s programs for safety, environmental protection, security, integrity and emergency management.</p>
<p>Companies are encouraged to examine each section of the OPR for applicability to their damage prevention programs. Note that a company’s damage prevention program will also consider and integrate many other aspects of the OPR, such as those addressed in sections&nbsp;18, 21, 22, 27, 29, 32 &ndash; 35, 39, 42, 46, and&nbsp;54.</p>
<p>Damage prevention programs are closely tied to the emergency management requirements in the OPR. Specifically, sections&nbsp;32 through&nbsp;35 of the OPR contain requirements for pipeline companies with respect to an emergency management program, emergency preparedness and response, continuing education and liaison, and section 39&nbsp;contains monitoring and surveillance requirements. These requirements should form part of a company’s damage prevention program.</p>
<p>The damage prevention program must meet the requirements of section&nbsp;4 of the OPR. A company’s damage prevention program must follow the compliance requirements of sections&nbsp;53 and&nbsp;55 of the OPR. This includes the requirement to conduct regular internal audits of the damage prevention program, with a maximum interval of three&nbsp;years.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>GOAL (Section&nbsp;56): Appropriate records are maintained.</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>p</em>) of the OPR requires that a company has a process for managing its records. The related record management system should outline what, when, and how appropriate records are to be created, stored, retrieved, modified, and removed (when no longer valid) in a timely manner. Companies are to maintain other appropriate records at pertinent locations to capture relevant reviews, analyses, and decisions made during the implementation of company programs.</p>
<p>A record management system should provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate a company’s due diligence as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of its programs in ensuring the safety of persons, security of the pipeline, and the protection of property and the environment during the design, construction, operation, and abandonment of its pipelines.</p>
<h2>ANNEXES</h2>
<h3 id="nnxa" class="list-unstyled">Annex&nbsp;A. Further Information for Emergency Management Program</h3>
<p>Annex&nbsp;A. provides further information for a company’s emergency management program (OPR sSection&nbsp;32-35).</p>
<h4>1. Hazard Assessment</h4>
<p>A company’s hazard assessment process for its emergency management program should include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>plume dispersion or similar dispersion modeling (if applicable);</li>
<li>identification and documentation of worst-probable emergencies involving the specific products being used or transported;</li>
<li>a determination of what can go wrong, its effects, its likelihood of occurrence, how often it could occur and the location of occurrence;</li>
<li>consideration of the dangers arising from human activity, such as fire, explosion, environmental contamination, hazardous substance release or pipeline ruptures, in addition to natural perils;</li>
<li>an evaluation of the potential for multi-hazard emergencies; and</li>
<li>measures that could reduce or eliminate the hazard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hazard assessment should be used to create and delineate the Emergency Planning Zone(s) to be utilized for developing the various elements of the emergency management program.</p>
<h4>2. Emergency Procedures Manual</h4>
<p>The contents of the emergency procedures manual should include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>manual distribution list (or on separate file);</li>
<li>manual updating procedures and schedule (or on a separate file);</li>
<li>description of initial actions when someone reports an incident;</li>
<li>definitions and levels of emergencies;</li>
<li>corporate and operational chains of command (e.g.,&nbsp;organization structures);</li>
<li>management of threat information;</li>
<li>incident management system (e.g.,&nbsp;Incident Command System);</li>
<li>spill control procedures and locations of spill control points (if applicable);</li>
<li>debriefing procedure;</li>
<li>internal and external communications;</li>
<li>external communication information, warnings and evacuations (e.g.,&nbsp;public relations or media plan);</li>

<li>templates and records to document the events, actions and meetings during an incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emergency procedures manuals must be submitted to the NEB. They are to be reviewed and updated by the company regularly and published on the company’s website as of 30&nbsp;September 2016. Portions of the published manuals may not be available where there is personal information or information that can affect the security of the pipeline or particular properties.</p>
<p>Order MO-006-2016 Compelling Publication of Emergency Procedures Manuals <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/Filing/A79720">[Filing&nbsp;A79720]</a></p>
<p>A company must also have a site-specific plan for sensitive areas. A sensitive area may be an area with a large population of people or an environmentally sensitive area such as wetlands, national parks, rivers and lakes.</p>
<h4>3. Incident Management System</h4>
<p>The NEB expects companies to have an incident management system such as the Incident Command System. The system should take into account the functions of the federal and provincial governments, local authorities and governments, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response.</p>
<p>The system should be a standardized approach to emergency management that includes personnel, facilities, equipment, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational structure.</p>
<h4>4. Liaison with Agencies Involved in Emergency</h4>
<p>NEB-regulated companies must establish and maintain a close working relationship with agencies that may be involved in an emergency response on a pipeline. These could include first responders, city planners, municipalities, and indigenous groups. Companies must have discussions with these agencies to make sure they co-ordinate the response if an incident occurs. These discussions must take place during the development and updating of the emergency procedures manual.</p>
<p> Examples of topics for discussion include:</p>
<ul>
<li>accountabilities</li>
<li>responsibilities</li>
<li>key roles</li>
<li>public safety measures</li>
<li>communications</li>
<li>response capabilities (including equipment, people and training)</li>
<li>response times</li>
</ul>
<p>In consulting with agencies that may be involved an emergency response, a company should, among any other relevant steps:</p>
<ul>
<li> use the hazard, safety and/or emergency planning zones calculated as part of the hazard assessment to identify the parties with whom liaison should be established;</li>
<li>have up-to-date contact lists;</li> 
<li>have a description of the consultation process including a schedule for contacts, nature of discussions, type of information to be provided and the methods to assess the effectiveness of the consultation process;</li>
<li>include records and documentation of all liaison activities; and</li>
<li>include actions taken based on the results of the feedback received.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Communication with Persons Involved in Emergency Response</h4>
<p>A company informs anyone associated with an emergency response activity on the pipeline of the relevant information consistent with the emergency procedures manual. This information should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type and locations of company facilities;</li>
<li>all potential hazardous products transported and/or stored at company facilities in significant volumes;</li>
<li>MSDS sheets or similar information on the properties of products;</li>
<li>plume dispersion information and ignition guidelines (if applicable);</li>
<li>spill control points;</li>
<li>key roles of all company personnel and agencies involved in an emergency response;</li>
<li>practices and procedures to be followed consistent with those specified in the emergency procedures manual; and</li>
<li>any relevant information consistent with the manual.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6. Providing Continuing Education for Emergency Response</h4>
<p>The company must develop a continuing education program for police, fire departments, medical facilities, and other organizations and agencies and the public living near the pipeline. The continuing education program informs these groups about the location of the pipeline, potential hazards and the emergency situations involving a pipeline, and the safety procedures to be followed in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p>This would also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>procedures for informing local authorities, response organizations, and the public, procedures on responder health and safety, and scene arrival protocols</li>
<li>how to notify the company of an incident</li>
<li>hotlines and/or websites set up to respond to inquiries during an emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>In developing and implementing continuing education for emergency management, a company should:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the hazard, safety and/or emergency planning zones calculated as part of the hazard assessment to identify the parties with whom continuing education should be conducted;</li>
<li>have up-to-date contact lists of all persons potentially affected by an emergency situation;</li>
<li>have a rationale for the methods used to distribute information as well as a documented assessment of the success in delivering the safety message;</li>
<li>document actions taken to deliver information and identify recipients including examples of the information delivery tools; and</li>
<li>include actions taken based on the results of the feedback received.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7. Emergency Response Processes and Capability</h4>
<p>A company’s emergency management program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>procedures for the safe control or shutdown of the pipeline system in the event of an emergency and safety procedures for personnel at emergency sites (CSA&nbsp;Z662 Clause&nbsp;10.5.2.1); and</li>
<li>verifiable capability to respond to an emergency in accordance with their emergency procedures and response plans demonstrated through exercises (OPR section&nbsp;46 and CSA&nbsp;Z662 Clause&nbsp;10.5.2.4).</li>
</ul>
<h4>8. Emergency Response Training and Exercises</h4>
<p>A company must have a training program for its employees to enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to support the company’s emergency management program. This includes training for persons having a role in an emergency (for example, those providing equipment or involved in the incident management system) and competency requirements. This ensures that staff and first responders are trained on all aspects of their roles and responsibilities as identified in the Emergency Procedures Manual.</p>
<p>A company is also required to demonstrate response capabilities. This is tested through exercises such as drills, tabletops, functional and full-scale exercises.</p>
<p>Emergency response exercises should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be held with sufficient frequency. At least one simulated exercise annually (e.g.,&nbsp;tabletop, functional) and a full scale exercise (involving all agencies identified in the company’s liaison) should be held at least every three&nbsp;years;</li>
<li>be varied to confirm that all aspects of potential emergencies are tested; and</li>
<li>simulate a wide range of potential geographic and weather conditions as well as worse-case spill or gas release scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<h4>9. Emergency Response Equipment</h4>
<p>An assessment on whether firefighting and other special equipment is necessary, based on the hazard assessment (CSA&nbsp;Z662 Clause 10.2.7.1).</p>
<p>Sufficient response equipment (including firefighter and special equipment) is necessary to respond to a serious emergency as determined by their hazard assessment (CSA&nbsp;Z662 Clause&nbsp;10.2.7.1).</p>
<p>Placement of equipment should be based on people, property and environmental considerations to minimize response times and reduce potential impacts of incidents. If equipment resides with mutual aid partners, spill co-operatives, government agencies or other organizations, formal agreements should be in place for access to the equipment by company personnel.</p>
<p>Companies should have documented procedures and schedules for preventative maintenance of response equipment. These procedures should include regularly scheduled sessions for operational testing and inventory control.</p>
<p>For further guidance in developing an emergency management program, companies may use the applicable provisions of the ISO 14000 series of Standards and CSA&nbsp;Z246.2 as a reference.</p>
<h3 id="nnxb" class="list-unstyled">Annex&nbsp;B. Further Information for Integrity Management Program</h3>
<p>Annex&nbsp;B. provides further information for a company’s integrity management program (OPR Section&nbsp;40).</p>
<h4>1. Records Management</h4>
<p>A company’s process for managing records (paragraph&nbsp;6.5(1)(<em>p</em>) of the OPR) related to the integrity management program follows the requirements of the applicable standards referred to in section&nbsp;4 of the OPR and the requirements of section&nbsp;56. A company’s records management process for its integrity management program, should allow timely access, by section, to records regarding the pipeline system.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>(a) The records should include information on the original pipe and all modifications and repairs such as:
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>(i) pipe material, manufacturer and date of manufacture, category, seam and girth weld type, grade, welder identification, non-destructive examination records, heat number and weld maps;</li>
<li>(ii) coating type for line pipe, joints and tie-ins, manufacturer, application method and weather conditions at the time of application;</li>
<li>(iii) repair history;</li>
<li>(iv) mapping;</li>
<li>(v) all pressure test data and records, maximum operating pressure, construction drawings, in-line inspection tool data and reports, corrosion control and cathodic protection records including design and survey results;</li>
<li>(vi) inspection records of pressure relieving and emergency shutdown devices; and</li>
<li>(vii) valve inspection records;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(b) A company’s process for record management should: 
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>(i) allow for documentation of condition monitoring and mitigation programs and past condition monitoring and mitigation decision analyses; and</li>
<li>(ii) provide for reviews of integrity management program effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Condition Monitoring</h4>
<p>Condition monitoring is intended to be a comprehensive, proactive, consistent, process where the various components of the process are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as necessary. Condition monitoring should include:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>(a) periodic internal inspections (frequency of inspections should be based on engineering principles) with in-line inspection (ILI) tools (or their equivalent) for all steel pipelines operating above 30% specified minimum yield strength;</li>
<li>(b) an engineering assessment (a documented assessment of variables using engineering principles) of facilities or line pipe segments to address pipeline integrity. Time-dependent, non-time-dependent and geotechnical hazards could be considered and investigated in the engineering assessment. The engineering assessment may consider the results of such methods as pressure testing, use of ILI tools and investigative digs. Note that cathodic protection surveys are not by themselves considered adequate to determine pipeline integrity;</li>
<li>(c) the risk assessment methods to be used when assigning priorities for integrity evaluation of facilities or line pipe segments. Factors which may be included in the risk assessment are items such as: product handled; pipeline location; stress levels; product pressure; pipeline age and condition; coating age and condition; cathodic protection data, and ILI data. Consideration may be given to determining the area affected (consequence) by a product release;</li>
<li>(d) where appropriate, monitoring and surveillance programs for slope movement, river crossings, depth of cover, frost heave and thaw settlement;</li>
<li>(e) a program to minimize third party damage including line patrols;</li>
<li>(f) the methods used to evaluate and maintain pipeline integrity and the criteria for their application, which may include:
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>(i) the use of the appropriate ILI tool technology and the methods used to verify ILI findings,</li>
<li>(ii) the hydrostatic retesting procedure,</li>
<li>(iii) the corrosion control monitoring methods and cathodic protection survey documentation,</li>
<li>(iv) the methods used to evaluate remaining life where defects exist,</li>
<li>(v) the methods used to verify the coating type and condition,</li>
<li>(vi) the methods used to establish equipment inspection intervals,</li>
<li>(vii) the methods used to inspect equipment, tankage and pressure vessels, and</li>
<li>(viii) any other methods for defect detection utilized;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(g) the procedures used to track, analyze and trend the condition of the pipeline; and</li>
<li>(h) the steps to be taken to evaluate the cause of a pipeline failure including the minimum investigation and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Mitigation</h4>
<p>A company’s mitigation process for ensuring integrity should consider:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>(a) the criteria and procedures for evaluation of imperfections and repair of pipelines containing defects;</li>
<li>(b) the procedure for performing consequence analyses to establish repair priorities;</li>
<li>(c) the criteria and procedures for consideration of such measures as pipe replacement, pipe repair, hot taps, hot work, excavation procedures, maintenance welding, recoating, hydrostatic retesting, and reduction in operating pressure (temporary or permanent);</li>
<li>(d) the criteria and methods for repair of tanks and pressure vessels;</li>
<li>(e) equipment and pipe isolation and purge procedures and de-icing and hydrate removal procedures, where applicable; and</li>
<li>(f) an outline of the short-term (i.e.,&nbsp;1 to 3&nbsp;year(s)) and long-term (i.e.,&nbsp;4 to 10&nbsp;years) mitigation program plans and priorities.</li>
</ul>

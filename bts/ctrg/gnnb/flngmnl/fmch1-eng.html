          <h2 id="s1_1">1.1 Background</h2>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board's (NEB or the Board) purpose is to promote
            safety, security, environmental protection and economic efficiency
            in the Canadian public interest through its regulation of pipelines,
            energy development and trade as mandated by Parliament. As a result,
            companies regulated by the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act) are
            required to obtain the Board's approval to, among other things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              add new facilities or modify or abandon existing facilities;
            </li>
            <li>export or import oil and gas products; and</li>
            <li>set tolls and tariffs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When seeking approval, applicants must submit applications or
            information filings (collectively referred to as filings) to the
            Board that are complete and that enable the Board to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              evaluate the overall public good that the request can create as
              well as its potential negative aspects;
            </li>
            <li>weigh the various impacts; and</li>
            <li>
              make an informed decision that balances, among other things, the
              economic, environmental and social interests at that point in
              time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While it is ultimately the responsibility of the applicant to make
            its case before the Board, this manual has been developed to provide
            direction regarding the information the Board would typically expect
            to see addressed in a filing. The goal is to provide applicants with
            a clear definition of the Board's expectations for complete filings.
            Complete filings should allow the Board to carry out more consistent
            assessments with fewer information requests and therefore, shorten
            timelines required to make a decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            As will be seen in the detailed requirements, in the process of
            assessing proposed projects, the Board uses a risk-oriented approach
            to evaluate issues, considering the probability and consequence of
            potential issues.

            Procedure,&nbsp;1995 (Rules). It is the Board's expectation that
            applicants will use this document to the extent necessary.
            Checklists of all the filing requirements (summarized) are included
            in Appendix&nbsp;I. The Board encourages applicants to submit
            completed checklists with each application. The Board may consider
            making the inclusion of the checklists mandatory in the future.

            <li>
              outline the filings needed for most applications within the
              jurisdiction of the NEB; and
            </li>
            <li>
              provide guidance as to the type of information the Board would
              typically need to make a decision.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Where a project does not appear to be addressed by this manual, the
            applicant is encouraged to contact the NEB for assistance.
          </p>
          <p>This manual is not explicitly applicable to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              oil and gas activities regulated under other Acts for which the

          <h2 id="s1_3">1.3 Organization</h2>
          <p>
            This manual is organized to easily identify the information required
            for each type of filing that is being made. In addition to the
            introductory information provided in Chapter&nbsp;1, this manual is
            divided into the following chapters:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Chapter&nbsp;2 describes how to use this manual and includes a
              flowchart that applicants can use to determine what elements are
              required in their filing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chapter&nbsp;3 is the initial chapter for all applications and
              identifies the information which must be addressed in every
              application. After completing the requirements of Chapter 3, the
              applicant must then determine whether to proceed to Chapter 4
              (physical projects) or Chapter 5 (non-physical projects).
            </li>
            <li>
              Chapter&nbsp;4 identifies the information required for physical
              project applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chapter&nbsp;5 identifies the information required for
              non-physical project applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chapter&nbsp;6 identifies the information required for filings
              other than applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chapter&nbsp;7 lists the NEB documents referenced throughout this
              manual.
            </li>
            <li>
              Appendix&nbsp;I includes the filing requirement checklists which
              applicants are encouraged to complete and submit with each
              application.

          <h2 id="s1_4">1.4 Content Structure</h2>
          <p>
            The Filing Manual has been designed to assist applicants to clearly
            understand the information and level of detail required for a
            filing. The filing requirements are generally presented in the
            following format:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              a goal statement that clarifies the purpose of providing the
              information;
            </li>
            <li>
              filing requirements that specify the information details that are
              needed;
            </li>
            <li>
              a guidance section that provides direction regarding, for example,
              the level of detail, potential issues and information references;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              grey boxes that provide direction to help determine if further
              information is required or not.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="s1_5">1.5 Confidential Filing</h2>

              Act</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>In respect of a filing related to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any regulatory proceeding (i.e.&nbsp;applications filed under the
              NEB Act or any other public hearing process under the NEB Act);
            </li>
            <li>
              Matters related to condition compliance where the condition is a
              &quot;for approval&quot; condition of the Board; or
            </li>
            <li>
              Any other matter where there is significant third party interest;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            an applicant may request that the NEB treat that filing as
            confidential, in accordance with section&nbsp;16.1 of the NEB Act.
            In order for such a request to be successful, the NEB must be
            satisfied that the filing meets the conditions set out in
            subsection&nbsp;16.1(a) or subsection&nbsp;16.1(b) of the NEB Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where a request to treat filing as confidential is due to a
            potential risk to the security of a facility, applicants may apply
            under section&nbsp;16.2 of the NEB Act. In order for such a request
            to be successful, the NEB must be satisfied that the filing meets
            the conditions set out in section&nbsp;16.2, and that the filing was
            made:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              in respect of any order of the Board made under the NEB Act;
            </li>
            <li>
              in any regulatory proceeding (i.e.&nbsp;applications filed under
              the NEB Act or any other public hearing process under the NEB
              Act);
            </li>
            <li>
              in respect of a matter relating to condition compliance where the
              condition is a &ldquo;for approval&rdquo; condition of the Board;
              or
            </li>
            <li>
              any other matter where there is significant third party interest.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Applicants for all requests made pursuant to section&nbsp;16.1 or
            section&nbsp;16.2 of the NEB Act must provide:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A cover letter containing the request and reasons for the
              requests, as well as a summary of the nature of the information to
              be treated confidentially;
            </li>
            <li>
              If possible, a redacted version of the filing (which does not
              contain the information requested to be kept confidential); and
            </li>
            <li>
              Three unredacted copies of the filing that the applicant requests
              to be kept confidential. The filings must be provided via hand
              delivery, ordinary mail, registered mail or courier to the
              Secretary of the Board in a double sealed envelope under
              confidential cover.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If the NEB is satisfied that the filing meets the conditions set out
            in subsections&nbsp;16.1(a) or&nbsp;16.1(b) or in section&nbsp;16.2,
            it may take measures that it considers necessary. One such measure
            is that only select NEB staff and Members responsible for the
            consideration of the filing would have access to the information,
            and the information would not be available to the public. The Board
            may also issue an order for rulings made pursuant to
            section&nbsp;16.1 or&nbsp;16.2.

          <p>
            such filings may be designated in accordance with the Security
            Organization and Administration Standard. The NEB protects sensitive
            information under its control in accordance with this standard. In
            order for a filing to be classified in accordance with this
            standard, it must be considered sensitive. That is, if it was
            compromised, it could reasonably be expected to cause injury outside
            the national interests, for example, damage to an individual's
            reputation. Applicants may wish to provide information which may
            assist the NEB in classifying a filing pursuant to the Security
            Organization and Administration Standard. Further information about
            the standard, particularly in regards to the levels of designation
            contained in the standard, can be obtained by viewing the

            <strong>Note:</strong> The Board will continue to treat all
            Emergency Response Manuals in accordance with the Security
            Organization and Administration Standard, even if treatment is not
            specifically requested. Therefore, no specific information is
            necessary for the filing of Emergency Response Manuals where such a
            filing is made in the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              outside of a regulatory proceeding (and where there is no

            </li>
            <li>
              condition compliance where the condition is <strong>not</strong> a

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Emergency Response Manuals being filed in the course of a regulatory
            proceeding, or during condition compliance where the condition is a
            &quot;for approval&quot; condition of the Board, or during any other
            matter where there is significant third party interest, must be
            accompanied by a request that the NEB treat a filing as confidential
            pursuant to section&nbsp;16.1 or&nbsp;16.2 of the NEB Act.

              emergency procedures manuals applicable to their NEB-regulated
              facilities on their or their affiliate’s internet site for public
              viewing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Board anticipates that the version of the Emergency Procedures
              Manual published on a company’s website would be sufficient for
              filing in most regulatory proceedings. Requests from regulatory
              proceeding participants for a version to be filed other than the
              version published on a company’s website would be considered on an
              individual basis by the Board and be subject to the considerations
              noted above in Section 1.5 Confidential Filing.

            1.10 Measurement, Conversion Factors and Commodity Description
          </h2>
          <p>
            Where possible, the Board would prefer that information within
            applications be presented in the International System of Units (SI),
            although it is helpful to include the imperial equivalent as well.
          </p>
          <p>The following conversion factors should be used:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>millimetre (mm) = 0.0394&nbsp;inches</li>
            <li>metre (m) = 3.28&nbsp;feet</li>
            <li>kilometre (km) = 0.62&nbsp;miles</li>
            <li>cubic metre (m&sup3;) = 35.3&nbsp;cf</li>
            <li>cubic metre = 6.29&nbsp;bbl</li>
            <li>kilopascal (kPa) = 0.145&nbsp;psi</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If other conversion rates are used, indicate this fact and provide
            the rates used.
          </p>
          <h3>Gas</h3>
          <p>
            For gas volumes, market requirements, estimates of reserves, and
            productive capacity estimates will be at a temperature of 15ºC and
            an absolute pressure of 101.325&nbsp;kPa. Gas composition should be
            expressed in mole percent, and the heating value of the gas should
            be expressed in megajoules per cubic metre (MJ/m&sup3;). Volumes are
            requested to be in metric units as cubic metres (m&sup3;) and
            production rates as cubic metres per day (m&sup3;/d). The imperial
            equivalent would be cubic feet (cf) and cubic feet per day (cf/d)
            respectively.
          </p>
          <h3>Liquids</h3>
          <p>
            Descriptions of crude oil and equivalents will include, at a
            minimum:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>classification of the crude oil;</li>
            <li>specific gravity;</li>
            <li>sulphur content upon which the classification is based; and</li>
            <li>
              other properties when they are important to the design of the
              facilities or third party interests, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  viscosity or water content could be important to the design of
                  the facilities; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  impurities could be of concern to third parties if more than
                  one product is transported on the same pipeline.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Natural gas liquids (NGL) composition should be expressed as a
            percent and vapour pressure will be at a specified temperature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Descriptions of refined hydrocarbons must include the type of
            product and any properties that might be important to the design of
            the facilities or third party interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            All other liquid commodities must be described in sufficient detail
            for the NEB to understand the nature of the commodity and how it
            might affect the design of the proposed facilities or third party
            interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            All liquids volumes, with the exception of NGL and cryogenic
            liquids, will be submitted as the volume such product would occupy
            at a temperature of 15ºC and an absolute pressure of
            101.325&nbsp;kPa, unless otherwise stated in the application. For
            NGL and cryogenic liquids, the temperature and pressure at which the
            submitted volumes are measured will be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liquid volumes are requested to be expressed as m&sup3; and
            production rates as m&sup3;/d. The imperial equivalent would be in
            barrels (bbl) and barrels per day (bbl/d), respectively.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s1_11">1.11 Filing with the National Energy Board</h2>
          <p>
            Parties who have the ability to file documents electronically are
            expected to file documents through the Board’s electronic document
            repository at www.neb-one.gc.ca. Any person who has the ability to
            access documents through the repository must accept service of a
            notification that the document is in the repository rather than
            requiring a hard copy of the document be served.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more information about filing electronically, please refer to
            the Filers Guide to Electronic Submission and the Memorandum of
            Guidance on Electronic Filing. Both of these documents are available
            on the Board’s Internet site at www.neb-one.gc.ca. Please note that
            e mails are not considered electronic filing and will not be
            accepted in a hearing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board’s electronic document repository will contain the full
            text of only those documents filed electronically (following the
            procedures mentioned above) and in hard copy. When documents are
            filed by hard copy or facsimile, the Board will undertake to file
            the documents on the submitters behalf. However, in some cases, the
            Board may choose to create an electronic placeholder for documents
            too large to submit electronically to the repository. In cases such
            as this, it will not be possible to view or search these documents.
            They will be made available for viewing in the Board’s library.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies are reminded not to file their security documents
            electronically, although they need to be available for examination

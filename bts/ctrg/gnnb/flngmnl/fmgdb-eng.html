            All pipeline companies are required to follow the National Energy
            Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations, which include a systematic
            approach to pipeline management, including abandonment. Those
            regulations require all NEB-regulated pipeline companies to
            establish, implement and maintain a management system that, among
            other things, integrates a pipeline company’s operational activities
            with its management of financial resources to meet its obligation to
            abandon its pipeline system. A systematic approach requires a
            pipeline company to have a documented organizational structure that
            sets out accountabilities, roles and responsibilities in relation to
            pipeline abandonment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies’ management of financial resources includes the proactive
            management of their obligations relating to the set aside and
            collection of abandonment funds. The Onshore Pipeline Regulations
            require pipeline companies to, as part of their management system,
            establish and implement a process for, among other things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Regular review of objectives and targets required to meet
              companies’ obligations to abandon a pipeline (assumptions would be
              refined as more detailed plans and assessments are developed);
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifying and managing any change that could affect pipeline
              abandonment, including financial aspects of pipeline abandonment
              (for example, changes to the assumptions underlying pipeline
              abandonment such as various pipeline segments or sets of
              facilities that may be abandoned on different timelines);
            </li>
            <li>
              Evaluating and managing the risks associated with, among other
              things, the financial aspects of pipeline abandonment;
            </li>
            <li>
              The internal and external communication of information relating to
              pipeline abandonment; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifying the documents required for the pipeline company to
              meet its obligation to abandon a pipeline.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            As of 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2015, NEB-regulated pipeline companies
            must have a process and mechanism in place that will provide
            adequate funds to pay for pipeline abandonment. Companies should
            also institute governance practices relating to pipeline
            abandonment, which are one component of the systematic approach
            required by the National Energy Board Onshore Pipeline Regulations.
          </p>
          <h3>B.1.1 Cost Estimates</h3>
          <p>
            Companies are required to file their abandonment cost estimates for
            Board approval. Companies’ filings should also include a description
            of the methodology and assumptions used to estimate costs. Provide a
            level of detail and technical description appropriate to allow a
            person to form a reasonable understanding the estimates to a
            reasonable level. See Chapter&nbsp;7 Referenced Documents,
            Abandonment Funding and Planning for documents that describe cost
            categories, abandonment assumptions and methodologies that have been
            used by companies and/or approved by the Board in the past.
          </p>
          <h3>B.1.2 Protection of Funds</h3>
          <p>
            Pipeline companies must establish a trust or provide a letter of
            credit issued by a bank listed in Schedule&nbsp;1 of the Bank Act,
            or a surety bond supplied by a surety company regulated by the
            Office of Superintendent of Financial Institutions. A model trust
            agreement, letter of credit and surety bond can be found in Reasons
            for Decision MH-001-2013. For information on accessing abandonment
            funds included in a letter of credit or surety bond, see the
            appropriate checklists and Table&nbsp;B-1 or Table&nbsp;B-2 below.
          </p>
          <h4>B.1.2.1 Trusts</h4>
          <p>
            A trust can be a suitable mechanism to set aside funds for pipeline
            abandonment. However, the question of whether any particular trust
            is suitable depends on the terms and conditions that govern the
            trust. Companies are encouraged to consult Chapter&nbsp;7:
            Referenced Documents, Abandonment Funding and Planning, for
            reference documents issued by the Board in regards to trusts. In
            particular, Appendix&nbsp;VI of the MH-001-2013 Reasons for Decision
            sets out Indicative Terms for companies proposing trusts. These
            should be viewed as the substantive minimum requirements that must
            be incorporated into a trust agreement. The Board has also issued
            subsequent compliance decisions regarding companies filing trusts.
          </p>
          <h4>B.1.2.2 Letter of Credit</h4>
          <p>
            If a company is using a letter of credit to set-aside funds, the
            financial instrument must meet the criteria included in the
            checklist below. To obtain funds please fill out the information
            included in Table&nbsp;B-1 or Table&nbsp;B-2.

            </li>
            <li>
              Amount: The letter of credit must be equal to a company’s approved
              Abandonment Cost Estimate (ACE). The Board does not allow growing

            <li>
              Notification: The beneficiary must be notified by fax and
              registered mail (to the attention of the Secretary of the Board)
              at least 60&nbsp;days before the letter of credit may be cancelled
              or not renewed. Upon notification the beneficiary must be entitled

          <h4>B.1.2.3 Surety Bond</h4>
          <p>
            If a company is using a surety bond to set-aside funds, the
            financial instrument must meet the criteria included in the
            checklist below.
          </p>
          <p>Surety Bond Checklist:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The surety must be regulated by the Office of the Superintendent
              of Financial Institutions (OSFI);
            </li>
            <li>
              The obligee must be the “Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada
              as represented by the National Energy Board”;
            </li>
            <li>
              The term of the bond must be indefinite. The bond may have a form
              of evergreen provision that automatically renews the bond unless
              notice of termination is given;
            </li>
            <li>
              The bond must be terminable by the surety providing 60&nbsp;days’
              notice, with the obligee then having a further 60&nbsp;day period
              to make a written demand of the surety;
            </li>
            <li>
              The bond must be structured as an on demand instrument. This may
              be accomplished by requiring the surety to pay the bond amount
              upon receiving a written demand of the obligee consistent with the
              form of bond provided to the Ontario Minister of the Environment
              under Part&nbsp;XII of the Environmental Protection Act (Ontario);
            </li>
            <li>
              The bond must reference the underlying regulatory obligations of
              the principal. For pipeline abandonment, the bond should reference
              the National Energy Board Act, RH-2-2008 Reasons for Decision, the
              Board document approving the pipeline company’s cost estimate, and
              the MH-001-2013 Reasons for Decision; and
            </li>
            <li>
              The surety may fulfill its obligations under the bond by:
              (i)&nbsp;remedying the default, (ii)&nbsp;completing the pipeline
              company’s abandonment obligations, or (iii)&nbsp;paying the bond
              balance to the Board. If these options are set out in the bond,
              then the Board must have the discretion to choose among them.

          <p>
            If an abandonment plan is shared with interested parties , any
            comments from these stakeholders should be considered and, where
            appropriate, incorporated into the plan.
          </p>

            Environmental, safety and land-use issues may all be considered in
            the application. The application may also address reclamation of
            sites where surface facilities have been or will be removed and the
            management of any pipeline components that will be maintained in a
            deactivated state.

          <h5>Abandonment-in-Place or Removal of Pipeline</h5>
          <p>
            Assessments and studies should be provided to support the choice
            between abandonment-in-place or removal of the pipeline. If the
            pipeline is to be removed, assess the impact of the removal on the
            environment. If the pipeline is to be abandoned in place, refer to
            CSA&nbsp;Z662, clause&nbsp;10.

            In 2009, the NEB’s Land Matters Consultation Initiative, a public
            forum to discuss various landowners concerns, generated a report, in
            part identifying the need for clarification on how pipeline
            abandonment is monitored.

              >This report is available on the NEB website</a

          <h4>Economics and Finance</h4>
          <h5>Abandonment Costs</h5>
          <p>
            See Chapter&nbsp;7 Referenced Documents, Abandonment Funding and
            Planning for documents that describe cost categories that the Board
            has found useful in examining cost estimates. Describe the
            methodology and assumptions used to estimate costs. Provide a level
            of detail and technical description appropriate to allow regulators,
            the public, and others to understand the estimates to a reasonable
            level.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, where pipe is proposed to be left in the ground,
            describe plugging intervals and costs. Where facilities are proposed
            to be removed identify the costs for dismantling and removal,
            reclamation, any remediation, and, where relevant, the costs and
            expected proceeds from salvage activities, including the timing of
            receipts of salvage proceeds.
          </p>
          <h5>Liability Exposure</h5>
          <p>The description of future liabilities should include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              of the types of each liability and an estimate of the associated
              cost; and
            </li>
            <li>
              a statement of which abandonment work is associated with a legal
              obligation and which work is not.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Financing</h5>
          <p>
            The confirmation that funding is and will continue to be available
            to fund the abandonment should include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              an explanation of the economic feasibility of the abandonment; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the expected toll treatment and toll impact, including:
              <ul>
                <li>an explanation of how the tolls were determined;</li>
                <li>
                  the expected impact, if any, on shippers and other parties;
                </li>
                <li>
                  a statement regarding the extent of shippers' and other
                  parties' support for any toll increase; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  describe any funding, financial guarantees or other
                  arrangements designed to cover these costs.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Provisions for Post-abandonment</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Provide a description about the mechanisms to be used to set-aside
              funds for post-abandonment activities.
            </li>
            <li>

              activities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Accounting</h5>
          <p>
            The GPUAR or OPUAR prescribe the accounting treatment for both
            ordinary and extraordinary retirements, including informing the
            Board if the gain or loss on an extraordinary retirement is
            material.

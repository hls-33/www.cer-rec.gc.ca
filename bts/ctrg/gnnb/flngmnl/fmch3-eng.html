            (2) Every application shall be divided into consecutively numbered
            paragraphs, each of which shall be confined as nearly as is
            practicable to a distinct portion of the subject-matter of the
            application.
          </p>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            Applicants must, in addition to looking at the Filing Manual, have
            regard to the NEB Act and regulations relevant to the filing for
            direction on what needs to be included.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s3_2">3.2 Application or Project Purpose</h2>
          <h4>Goal</h4>
          <p>
            The application provides clearly articulated reasons for the
            application.

          </p>
          <h2 id="s3_3">3.3 Management Systems and Programs under the OPR</h2>
          <h4>Goal</h4>
          <p>
            To demonstrate how an applicant’s management system required under
            the OPR will support and achieve adequate safety and environmental
            protection in the context of the current project application.
          </p>
          <h4>Filing Requirement</h4>
          <p>An applicant must provide:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              an overview of its management system, including a description of:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                how programs required under the OPR are coordinated within the
                management system to promote safety and environmental
                protection; and
              </li>
              <li>
                the process for any necessary modifications to the management
                system.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            The NEB conducts ongoing reviews of company management system and
            compliance with the requirements of the OPR through its auditing
            oversight. However, in addition to this, it is important for public
            transparency and clarity that applicants explain how safety and
            environmental protection are integrated, coordinated and controlled
            within their management systems and will be ensured for any proposed
            new facility.
          </p>
          <p>
            A carefully-designed and well-implemented management systems
            supports a strong culture of safety and is fundamental to keeping
            people safe and protecting the environment. Sections&nbsp;6.1
            to&nbsp;6.6 of the OPR detail the required elements of a company’s
            management system. It must be a systematic approach designed to
            effectively manage and reduce risk through necessary organizational
            structures, resources, accountabilities, policies, processes and
            procedures, and must include measures to evalute effectiveness and
            promote continual improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            A company’s management system must also coordinate the following
            five programs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Emergency Management Program to ensure appropriate emergency
              preparedness and response (OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;32).
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrity Management Program to ensure the pipeline system
              continually operates within its design parameters
              (OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;40).
            </li>
            <li>
              Safety Management Program to protect workers and the public from
              occupational and process hazards (OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;47).
            </li>
            <li>
              Security Management Program to protect people, property and the
              environment from malicious damage (OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;47.1).
            </li>
            <li>
              Environmental Protection Program to avoid or reduce adverse
              effects on the environment (OPR&nbsp;section&nbsp;48).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Section&nbsp;6.5 of the OPR lists a number of processes and
            requirements that must be part of a company’s management system and
            each of the above five programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Section&nbsp;6.2 requires the appointment of an Accountable Officer
            and that their name and acceptance of responsibilties be filed with
            the Board. For further information on the OPR and related supporting
            documentation, please refer to the NEB’s website.
          </p>
          <p>
            A company’s management systems applies to the entire lifecycle of a
            project, from planning and design, through construction and
            operation, to abandonment. It is therefore relevant at all stages of
            a project, including the application stage.
          </p>
          <div

            <p><strong>FYI &ndash; Examples...</strong></p>
            <p>
              The information to fulfill many of the requirements in this Filing
              Manual for pipeline projects should be based upon a company’s
              management system processes. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Engineering design details required in Guide&nbsp;A.1 for
                facilities applications should be based upon implementation of
                processes within the Integrity Management Program, such as
                hazard identification, risk assessment, development of control
                and monitoring measures, and identification of legal
                requirements. Such processes will be similarly applicable to
                applications for abandonment (Guide&nbsp;B), variances related
                to physical activities (Guide&nbsp;O), leave to open
                (Guide&nbsp;T), etc. Design details may also be affected by
                other programs, such as the security assessment for the project
                conducted under the Security Management Program.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implementation of processes within the Environmental Protection
                Program will support the information requirements for the
                environmental and socio-economic assessment, such as in
                Guide&nbsp;A.2.6.1 (identification and analysis of effects) and
                Guide&nbsp;A.2.8 (inspection, monitoring and follow-up).
                Processes related to accidents and malfunctions within the
                Emergency, Safety and Security Management Programs can similarly
                contribute to these Guide requirements.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Various management system processes will also apply throughout the
              application stage, such as ensuring the training and competency of
              those involved in the development of the project design and of the
              application documents; quality assurance; document and record
              control; management of change if design details are altered; and
              ensuring that work performed by consultants and contractors is
              consistent with all obligations and responsibilities under the
              company’s management system.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The Board expects an applicant to have applied relevant components
            of its management system and programs to the planning and design of
            the proposed project and related application documents, and to have
            reviewed those components for necessary modification in the event
            the proposed project goes ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
            An application that is lacking (such as containing an incomplete
            discussion of hazards, risks and controls) might indicate that the
            applicant’s management system and program components are inadequate.
            The Board expects companies to prevent such deficiencies, correct
            any that are identified, avoid similar deficiencies in future
            applications, and to apply lessons learned as broadly as possible.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s3_4">3.4 Consultation</h2>
          <p>
            The Board expects an applicant to have a company-wide Consultation
            Program that establishes a systematic, comprehensive and proactive
            approach for the development and implementation of project-specific
            consultation activities. A Consultation Program should be
            appropriately integrated into a company’s overall management system
            to provide protection for the public, employees, property and the
            environment throughout the lifecycle (design, construction,
            operation, maintenance, abandonment) of a pipeline system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board expects applicants will consider consultation for all
            projects. Depending on the project scope, that could mean carrying
            out extensive consultation activities or a simple consultation
            activity such as notifying a single landowner. Applicants are
            responsible to justify the extent of consultation carried out for
            each application. Applicants may also make use of the Board’s
            publications to inform potentially affected persons about the NEB
            and its processes. On the NEB‘s website there is a detailed list of
            our publications and what each is used for. (See
            <a href="/prtcptn/gdnccmpnsnbpblctn-eng.html"
              >Guidance for Companies on NEB Publications</a
            >
            under Participation &amp; Lands.)
          </p>
          <p>The following information is required within the application:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An overview of the policies and goals of the Consultation Program;
            </li>
            <li>
              A description of the design of the project-specific consultation
              activities; and
            </li>
            <li>
              A description of the outcomes of the project-specific consultation
              activities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of these information requirements is discussed in further
            detail in the following sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no project-specific consultation activities are implemented, an
            explanation is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also expects companies to conduct effective public
            consultation activities during the construction and operation phases
            of a project. The Board’s requirements for public consultation
            related to operations and maintenance activities on pipelines can be
            found on the NEB’s website in the “Operations and Maintenance
            Activities on Pipelines Regulated Under the National Energy Board
            Act: Requirements and Guidance Notes: (January 2013)”.

            3.4.1 Policies and Goals of the Consultation Program
          </h3>
          <h4>Goal</h4>
          <p>
            The application outlines the corporate policy or vision with respect
            to consultation and the principles and goals that guide the
            applicant's Consultation Program.
          </p>
          <h4>Filing Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            Provide an overview of the company's consultation philosophy, which
            should include, but not be limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the corporate policy or vision with respect to consultation.

              applicable.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            The Board expects an applicant to develop and implement a
            Consultation Program to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage
            conditions which have the potential to affect persons and groups. A
            Consultation Program should be based on the elements of a standard
            management system (for example, the management system elements
            described in the NEB’s Onshore Pipeline Regulations). Additional
            guidance is provided in the NEB’s Draft Expectations for Public
            Involvement Programs
            <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/Filing/A22289"

            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board also expects applicants to consider the language needs of
            the potentially affected persons and/or groups and include a
            description of this consideration in their application. Further to
            s.41 of the Official Languages Act, the Board is committed to
            fostering the full recognition and use of both English and French in
            Canadian Society. The Board recognizes the importance of considering
            official languages when developing and implementing a consultation
            program, to result in effective communication with potentially
            affected persons in the official language of their choice.

            3.4.2 Designing Project-Specific Consultation Activities
          </h3>
          <h4>Goal</h4>
          <p>
            The application indicates why the design of project-specific
            consultation activities is appropriate for the nature of the project
            in alignment with the company’s Consultation Program.
          </p>
          <h4>Filing Requirement</h4>
          <p>
            Provide a description of the project-specific consultation
            activities and the factors that influenced the design.
          </p>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            When designing project-specific consultation activities, applicants
            should consider that the Board expects consultation activities will,
            at a minimum:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              be initiated as soon as possible in the planning and design phase
              of a project;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide clear, relevant and timely information to potentially
              affected persons or groups;
            </li>
            <li>
              be accessible to and inclusive of all potentially affected persons
              or groups;
            </li>
            <li>
              be responsive to the needs, inputs and concerns of potentially
              affected persons or groups, and demonstrate how this informed the
              proposed design and operation of the Project; and
            </li>
            <li>
              continue throughout the regulatory process, as well as the
              construction and operation phases of a project.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When consultation includes Aboriginal groups, applicants should
            consider establishing a consultation protocol in collaboration with
            these groups that takes into consideration their needs and cultural
            elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            When relevant, applicants are also encouraged to consider
            establishing a consultation agreement with a municipal or regional
            government regarding pipeline and other energy-related developments
            that takes into consideration the unique needs of the municipality
            or regional government.

            describe the:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              potentially affected persons or groups to be consulted, including:
              <ul>

            <li>workshops.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Aboriginal groups potentially affected by the project can be
            identified by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              considering the location of Indian reserve lands, Métis or other
              Aboriginal populations, and the traditional territory that may be
              claimed by one o more Aboriginal groups;
            </li>
            <li>
              contacting regional Aboriginal organizations or government
              agencies familiar with local Aboriginal groups;
            </li>
            <li>
              requesting a preliminary list of potentially impacted Aboriginal
              groups from Natural Resources Canada’s Major Projects Management
              Office or the NEB;
            </li>
            <li>

              (ATRIS) of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; and
            </li>
            <li>
              taking into consideration past experience working in the area.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Local and Traditional Knowledge</h5>
          <p>
            Consider augmenting the application with local and traditional
            knowledge and integrating the information and knowledge, where
            appropriate, into the design of the project. Where local and
            traditional knowledge is obtained, provide an opportunity for the
            individual who provided the information to confirm the
            interpretation of the information and how it was used in the project
            design.
          </p>
          <h5>Identifying Government Authorities</h5>
          <p>
            Ensure the appropriate government authorities (local, regional,
            provincial and federal) are included in the consultation process. In
            some cases, regulatory approval from another authority will be
            required. Contact that authority to determine their information
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="#t3_1">Table&nbsp;3-1</a> (located at the end of
            Chapter&nbsp;3) while not exhaustive, identifies federal authorities
            that might need to be contacted for certain projects. The list is
            intended for assistance and guidance only &ndash; applicants are
            responsible for obtaining all necessary approvals for any project.
            The Board accepts no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness
            of this list.
          </p>
          <h5>Consultation Regarding Emergency Management</h5>
          <p>
            Sections&nbsp;32 to 35 of the OPR describe requirements for an
            Emergency Management Program which apply to a company’s operations.
            Effective emergency response planning requires liaison and
            consultation with federal, provincial, and municipal governments,
            Aboriginal groups, and associated first responders. The Board
            assesses a company’s Emergency Management Program throughout
            operations through its compliance verification activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a proposed project, it may also be appropriate to initiate
            consultation during the application process with those agencies and
            organizations that may be involved in an emergency response. The
            need for and depth of consultation with these agencies and
            organizations should be informed by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the assessment of potential risks associated with the project;
            </li>
            <li>
              the level of public concern regarding emergency management
              planning and emergency response associated with the project; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the extent to which an applicant’s emergency response plans would
              interact with, and rely on those of first responders and other
              agencies for initial or ongoing response activities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Agencies consulted with may include but not be limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>police;</li>
            <li>fire departments, including volunteer fire departments;</li>
            <li>emergency medical services;</li>
            <li>provincial emergency management organizations;</li>
            <li>provincial regulators and ministries of environment;</li>
            <li>federal departments;</li>
            <li>municipalities;</li>
            <li>Aboriginal groups;</li>
            <li>waste management companies; and</li>
            <li>spill co-operatives.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal of the consultation is to ensure that those agencies and
            organizations that may be involved in an emergency response related
            to a proposed project have been adequately consulted and that any
            concerns raised have been considered and addressed as appropriate.
            Applicants are reminded to refer to guidance throughout Section 3.4
            Consultation when designing and implementing consultation activities
            related to emergency management and regarding how the applicant
            considered the results of its consultation.

              maintaining liaison with agencies that may be involved in an
              emergency and for developing a continuing education program for
              appropriate organizations and agencies.

            The Applicant should provide confirmation of adequate notice by
            providing a description of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the process by which potentially affected persons and groups can
              contact the Board before the Board makes its decision; and
            </li>
            <li>the methods and timing of notification and consultation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Applicant should maintain records and be prepared to further
            demonstrate the adequacy of the notice that was provided to all
            potentially affected persons and groups.
          </p>
          <p>See Guidance in 3.4.2.</p>
          <p>
            For consultation activities that could involve a large number of
            people, it might not be practical to list all individuals that were
            consulted. It may be more practical to describe the main groups and
            why they are identified. For example, where a group has a common
            concern or association, describe:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the group;</li>
            <li>their location;</li>
            <li>their common concern; and</li>
            <li>the authority of any representatives of the group.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Concerns</h5>
          <p>
            To close the loop in consultation activities and address concerns
            before they become complaints, the Board expects applicants to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              seek to understand the full nature of concerns expressed by
              persons or groups;
            </li>
            <li>
              consider the feasibility of any mitigation proposed by persons or
              groups to address those concerns;
            </li>
            <li>respond to concerns; and</li>
            <li>work with persons or groups to jointly resolve concerns.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="s3_4_4">
            3.4.4 Justification for Not Undertaking Consultation Activities
          </h3>
          <h4>Goal</h4>
          <p>
            The application provides justification of why it was not necessary
            to carry out consultation activities with respect to the proposed
            project.
          </p>
          <h4>Filing Requirement</h4>
          <p>
            Explain why consultation activities were considered unnecessary.
          </p>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            Consultation activities might not be necessary if the applicant can
            demonstrate that one or more of the following scenarios applies:
          </p>
          <h5>Equivalent Consultation Activities</h5>
          <p>
            In the event that the project has been the subject of an equivalent
            consultation process carried out under the auspices of another
            agency, or conducted by another company or agency:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>describe the alternative consultation activities;</li>
            <li>
              provide evidence that these activities identified the project that
              is being applied for and its potential impacts; and
            </li>
            <li>
              demonstrate that these alternative activities meet the
              requirements of this section of the manual.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, where a road widening requires that an existing
            NEB-regulated pipeline be relocated, the responsible transportation
            authorities might conduct consultation activities for the road
            widening that includes consultation regarding the relocation of the
            pipeline. The pipeline application would then include a description
            of these consultation activities and how it meets the requirements
            of this manual.
          </p>
          <h5>No or Negligible Environmental or Socio-economic Effects</h5>
          <p>
            Applicants will be conducting environmental and socio-economic
            assessments of the project in accordance with the requirements of
            the NEB Act, the CEAA&nbsp;2012 and this manual (see Guide&nbsp;A
            within Chapter&nbsp;4).
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this assessment process, applicants will determine the
            potential adverse effects of the project. If the project's potential
            environmental and socio-economic effects are negligible, public
            consultation activities might be unnecessary. A project with
            negligible effects might exist where the following conditions are
            met:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the proposed project is of a small scale and is localized;</li>
            <li>all construction is to occur on previously disturbed land;</li>
            <li>there is no potential for an impact on navigation;</li>
            <li>
              the land acquisition process is complete and landowner concerns
              have been addressed;
            </li>
            <li>there are no residents near the proposed project;</li>
            <li>
              no other land uses or waterway uses or interests would be
              affected;
            </li>
            <li>
              there is no potential for traditional use activities to be
              affected by the project;
            </li>
            <li>
              there is no potential for cumulative environmental effects; and
            </li>
            <li>
              there would be negligible environmental effects associated with
              construction and operation of the project.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div

            <p><strong>Additional information...</strong></p>
            <p>
              Be sure to demonstrate how any environmental and socio-economic
              effects of the project are negligible.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5>Facilities within Company Owned or Leased Lands</h5>
          <p>The application is a facilities application that relates to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              work contained within the confines of land the applicant owns or
              leases (not including land upon which the applicant holds an
              easement only), except where those facilities or activities:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  relate to an increase in the storage or disposal of toxic
                  substances;
                </li>
                <li>could result in increased noise emissions;</li>
                <li>
                  could result in increased emissions of air contaminants; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  could result in local nuisance, including the potential for
                  increased dust or traffic.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Other Scenarios</h5>
          <p>
            Consultation activities may not be feasible if the project involves:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              additional acquisitions required to support the day-to-day
              operations of a pipeline or international power line (e.g.,
              standby plant, or materials and supplies); or
            </li>
            <li>
              work performed as part of a contingency project such as emergency
              repairs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="s3_5">3.5 Notification Of Commercial Third Parties</h2>
          <p>
            Notification of commercial third parties is normally required when
            the outcome of the application will affect such matters as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>tolls or tariffs;</li>
            <li>
              the ability of third parties to receive, transport or deliver
              commodities; and
            </li>
            <li>supply, transportation or sales contracts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Board must be assured that all commercial third parties who
            could be affected by the decision are aware of the application and
            have had the opportunity to comment should they wish to do so.
          </p>
          <h4>Goal</h4>
          <p>
            The application includes evidence that all interested commercial
            third parties that could be potentially affected by the outcome of
            the application have been advised of the application.
          </p>
          <h4>Filing Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            1. Confirm that all commercial third parties who could potentially
            be affected in any way by the outcome of the application have been
            notified and include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the method used to notify those parties; and</li>
            <li>when the parties were notified.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            2. Provide details regarding the concerns of third parties. This
            might include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>confirmation that no concerns were raised;</li>
            <li>confirmation that concerns raised have been resolved; or</li>
            <li>
              a list of the commercial third parties who have outstanding
              concerns and a discussion of their unresolved concerns.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            3. List the self-identified interested third parties and confirm
            they have been notified.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Provide an explanation in the event that notification of
            commercial third parties was considered unnecessary.
          </p>
          <h4>Guidance</h4>
          <h5>Identifying Commercial Third Parties</h5>
          <p>
            Commercial third parties include those who could be directly or
            indirectly commercially affected by the outcome of an application.
            This should include shippers and could also include commodity
            suppliers, end users and other pipelines. The following are examples
            of when to consider certain commercial third parties to be affected
            by an application:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              consider all shippers to be affected parties requiring
              notification of all tolls and tariff applications filed pursuant
              to Part&nbsp;IV of the NEB Act and all applications that could
              significantly affect tolls or tariffs;
            </li>
            <li>
              consider all shippers, suppliers and end users to be affected
              parties when the outcome of the application would significantly
              affect service on the pipeline; and
            </li>
            <li>
              consider operators of competitive facilities, whether regulated by
              the NEB or not, to be affected commercial third parties when the
              outcome of the application could reasonably be expected to have a
              significant adverse impact on their operations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Third parties involved in physical construction activities (e.g.,
            contractors, material vendors, consultants) or that supply food and
            accommodation would not normally be considered to be affected
            commercial third parties.
          </p>
          <h5>Notification</h5>
          <p>
            Inform the commercial third parties that an application has been, or
            will be, submitted to the NEB and provide a brief description.
            Notification should normally be done no later than the filing date
            of the application with the NEB. A copy of the application may be
            provided with the notification, be provided upon request or may
            constitute notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            When determining the level of detail in the notification, consider
            the:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>scope of the project;</li>
            <li>potential impact on commercial third parties;</li>
            <li>
              nature of any concerns raised by commercial third parties; and
            </li>
            <li>resolution of concerns raised.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In general, the greater the scope of the project and the potential
            impact on commercial third parties the more information would be
            required. Further, more detailed information would normally be
            required when concerns have been raised by commercial third parties
            and remain unresolved at the time of filing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the outcome of the application could affect specific
            commercial third parties, notify the individual parties. However,
            where a group with similar interests might be affected, such as
            western Canada producers or a group of end users, the applicant may
            choose to notify a recognized organization representative of the
            group such as the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers or the
            Industrial Gas Users Association.
          </p>
          <h5>Concerns</h5>
          <p>
            Where concerns have been raised and resolved, include a discussion
            of the resolution when it would assist the NEB in making a decision.
            When providing a list of unresolved concerns, provide any other
            information that would assist the NEB to understand the issues,
            including a discussion of any attempts to reach agreement, such as a
            summary of the consultative process that was used prior to filing
            the application.
          </p>
          <h5>Self-identified, Interested Third Parties</h5>
          <p>
            Self-identified, interested third parties refers to third parties
            who have indicated to the applicant that they have an interest in
            the application or one or more types of applications filed with the
            NEB.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether any commercial third parties could be affected by the
            application or not, the NEB expects that the applicant will notify
            all self-identified interested third parties.
          </p>
          <h5>When Notification is Not Required</h5>
          <p>
            Notification might not be required if the outcome of the application
            is not expected to result in any significant impacts on commercial
            third parties, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              facilities applications for routine operational maintenance and
              repair where:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  access to facilities might be temporarily interrupted during
                  construction, but service will not be interrupted; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  the toll impact would be immaterial or considered to be a
                  routine adjustment in a negotiated tolls agreement;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              applications for construction on an owner-operated pipeline where
              the owner is the sole shipper;
            </li>
            <li>
              applications concerning crossing matters, leave to open,
              deviation, change in class location or right of entry that would
              not affect tolls or the operation of the pipeline; and
            </li>
            <li>
              applications to change the name of a pipeline owner that does not
              involve the sale of the pipeline or a change in operation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The requirements for consultation, described in Section&nbsp;3.4
            &ndash; Consultation, continue to apply even if it is decided there
            are no commercial third parties to notify of an application.

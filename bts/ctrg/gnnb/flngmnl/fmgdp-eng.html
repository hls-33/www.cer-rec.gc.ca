                <p>
                  Pursuant to subsection&nbsp;60(1) of the National Energy Board
                  Act (the Act), all companies may only charge tolls specified
                  in a tariff that has been filed with the Board and is in
                  effect or that have been approved by an order of the Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pipeline companies regulated by the Board are divided into two
                  groups for financial regulation purposes. Group&nbsp;1
                  companies are generally identified as those with extensive
                  systems under the Board's jurisdiction, whereas those with
                  lesser operations are designated as Group&nbsp;2 companies.
                  Companies may be designated as Group&nbsp;1 either in the
                  Board's Gas Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations or Oil
                  Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations (collectively, the
                  G/OPUAR), or by direction of the Board. Group&nbsp;1 companies
                  are listed in section&nbsp;P.6 of this Guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A Group&nbsp;1 pipeline company not regulated on a complaint
                  basis (see footnote&nbsp;5 in Guide&nbsp;R) that has not
                  reached a negotiated settlement with its interested parties is
                  regulated on a cost-of-service basis and is required to
                  provide the information outlined in the filing requirements
                  within sections&nbsp;P.1 to&nbsp;P.5 of this guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a company has reached a negotiated settlement with its
                  interested parties, the filing requirements are outlined in
                  the Revised Guidelines for Negotiated Settlements of Traffic,

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>15. Fair Return Standard:</strong> The application shall
            explicitly demonstrate how the applied-for total return on capital
            meets all requirements of the fair return standard by describing the
            extent to which the applied-for return:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              is comparable to the return available from the application of the
              invested capital to other enterprises of like risk (the comparable
              investment requirement);
            </li>
            <li>
              enables the financial integrity of the regulated enterprise to be

              reasonable terms and conditions (the capital attraction
              requirement).

          <p>
            All other pipeline companies regulated by the Board are Group&nbsp;2
            companies for traffic, tolls, tariff and financial regulation.
          </p>
          <h4>Tolls and Tariffs</h4>
          <p>
            The financial regulation of Group&nbsp;2 companies is normally
            carried out on a complaint basis, with a consequent reduction in
            financial reporting requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Group&nbsp;2 companies are not normally required to provide the
            detailed information to support a tariff filing required of
            Group&nbsp;1 companies. The Board regulates the traffic, tolls and
            tariffs of Group&nbsp;2 companies on a complaint basis. Group&nbsp;2
            companies are required to include in their tariffs the following
            explanatory note:
          </p>
          <p class="mrgn-lft-md">
            The tolls of the Company are regulated by the National Energy Board
            on a complaint basis. The Company is required to make copies of
            tariffs and supporting financial information readily available to
            interested persons. Persons who cannot resolve traffic, toll and
            tariff issues with the Company may file a complaint with the Board.
            In the absence of a complaint, the Board does not normally undertake
            a detailed examination of the Company's tolls.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the responsibility of a Group&nbsp;2 company to provide its
            shippers and interested parties with sufficient information to
            enable them to determine whether a complaint is warranted. Upon
            receipt of a written complaint, an application under Part&nbsp;IV of
            the Act or on its own initiative, the Board may decide to examine a
            toll and to make the toll interim, pending completion of this
            examination. In this circumstance, the Board may request additional
            information including some or all of the information required of
            Group&nbsp;1 companies as specified in sections&nbsp;P.1
            through&nbsp;P.5 in Guide&nbsp;P of the Board's Filing Manual.
          </p>
          <h4>Accounting Requirements and Financial Reporting</h4>
          <p>
            The Board has exempted all Group&nbsp;2 companies from the
            requirement to keep their books of account pursuant to the code of
            accounts prescribed in the G/OPUAR. The Board only requires that
            Group&nbsp;2 companies maintain separate books of account in Canada
            in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles
            and file audited financial statements within 120&nbsp;days after the
            end of each fiscal year. Such statements should provide details of
            revenue and costs associated with the regulated pipeline. Where a
            Group&nbsp;2 company operates a joint venture pipeline, it is
            required to disclose in its audited financial statements its
            beneficial share of revenue and costs associated with the regulated
            pipeline and to file a gross operating statement for the joint
            venture pipeline indicating whether, and if so by whom, this
            statement has been audited.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some instances, the Board has granted relief from the requirement
            to file financial statements. These instances have primarily
            concerned small shipper-owned pipelines with no direct dealings with
            third parties. A Group&nbsp;2 company may apply for similar relief
            explaining the particular circumstances which would justify an
            exemption from this requirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board has exempted Group&nbsp;2 companies from the Toll
            Information Regulations. The Board does not require Group&nbsp;2
            companies to provide periodic financial information, such as
            quarterly surveillance reports, for the purpose of monitoring the
            financial performance of these companies. As circumstances dictate,
            the Board may perform an audit of the company's records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether they charge tolls or not, Group&nbsp;2 companies are
            required to report to the NEB on funding for abandonment. See
            Chapter&nbsp;7: Referenced Documents, Abandonment Funding and
            Planning for future guidance on details of pipe location,
            abandonment plans and cost estimates, as well as Collection Period.
          </p>
          <h2 id="sp_7">P.7 Abandonment Costs</h2>
          <p>
            As of 1&nbsp;January 2015 NEB-regulated pipeline companies must have
            a mechanism in place that will provide adequate funds to pay for
            pipeline abandonment. Pipeline companies must establish a trust or

            A company’s application should include any changes related to
            abandonment funding. Provide a discussion and justification of these
            changes, including any changes related to the total cost estimated
            for abandonment, the manner which the funds will be set-aside, and
            how the funds are to be collected, including the pace of collecting
            funds.

            On 19&nbsp;June 2016 the <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> came into
            force, making important changes to the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEBA), and to some extent the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA). Further
            information regarding the legislative changes can be found on our

            <li>
              Companies already had unlimited liability when proven to be at
              fault or negligent. The concept of absolute liability means that
              companies operating major oil pipelines will now also be liable
              for all costs and damages up to $1&nbsp;billion, regardless of
              fault.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Absolute Liability limit is set for companies operating major
              oil pipelines in the Act, and this will be done for other
              pipelines in the regulations. The criteria used to assess
              applicability of the $1&nbsp;billion limit is the company’s
              capacity to transport at least 250,000 barrels of oil a day from a
              pipeline or pipelines.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is also important to understand that the legislation requires a
              company to hold a minimum amount of financial resources to pay the
              Absolute Liability limit that applies to it, or any greater amount
              that the NEB may specify. ($1&nbsp;billion liability =
              $1&nbsp;billion financial resources)

            <li>
              The NEB can order a company to have financial resources that are
              greater than the limit of liability that applies to them.

            <li>
              Absolute liability for companies that do not qualify as a major

              absolute liability limit) that the NEB decides is prudent.

            <li>
              The legislation states that absolute liability limits for

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Under the NEB Act, the NEB must hold a public hearing (written or
              oral) to consider abandonment applications. More information is

          <ul>
            <li>
              Companies were liable for contamination resulting from their
              pipeline, and had a civil liability obligation for damages that
              were a direct result of an abandoned pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> clarifies that the pipeline will
              remain under the NEB’s jurisdiction in perpetuity or until it is
              removed from the ground, which means the pipeline company has
              liability as long as a pipeline remains in place.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The NEB has been working since 2009 to establish a pipeline
              abandonment fund for every pipeline that it regulates. This
              process involves funds being set aside for each pipeline with a
              third party.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result, a landowner will be able to have issues addressed
              after abandonment regardless of whether a pipeline company
              continues to exist or not.

          <ul>
            <li>
              In the event of a release, the NEB requires a company to take any
              measures required to stop the flow of hydrocarbons, clean up the
              mess and ensure appropriate environmental remediation. This is not
              new.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> provides the NEB with the
              additional authority to order a company to pay others that have
              incurred costs or expenses in relation to a spill.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, the company would be absolutely liable (that is,
              liable without proof of fault or negligence) for the applicable
              limit of Absolute Liability for things like loss or damages and
              loss of non-use value of a public resources. Where fault has been
              determined by a court, there would be no limit to what the company

              the Governor in Council can take the decision to “designate” it.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Designating” a company sets in motion various procedures that
              include allowing the NEB to access money in an industry pooled
              fund and money that may be appropriated from the Consolidated
              Revenue Fund to pay for costs and expenses.
            </li>
            <li>
              These funds would then be cost recovered from the designated
              company and other specified companies.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this circumstance, Governor in Council could also establish a

            <li>
              The <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> updates the <em>NEB Act </em>to

              Farmers’ ground disturbance activities on their lands are
              restricted in  the “prescribed area” of a pipeline, which is a
              strip of land measured 30 metres perpendicularly on each side from
              the centre line of a pipe. This is necessary to protect the farmer
              as well as the environment. Cultivation that is less than 45 cm
              deep and any other activities that are less than 30cm deep, and
              that do not result in a reduction of cover over the pipeline, are
              not considered ground disturbances according to the
              <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> and therefore do not require
              permission of the pipeline company, or NEB, before proceeding.

            <li>
              In order to avoid enforcement actions, landowners should follow
              the requirements for authorization outlined in the
              <em
                >National Energy Board Damage Prevention Regulations-
                Authorizations.
              </em>
              These regulations include requirements to:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Contacting the pipeline company to obtain its consent to
                  construct a facility near the pipeline or perform a ground
                  disturbance activity within the prescribed area;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contacting the one-call centre or the pipeline company
                  directly if there are no one-call centres serving your area,
                  to have the pipeline located.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              The NEB requires companies to provide landowners with information
              on how they can conduct their activities near pipelines safely.
              This should be done as part of a company’s Public Awareness
              Program. The NEB audits companies’ Damage Prevention Programs
              periodically to confirm they are meeting the Public Awareness
              requirement and holds companies accountable if they do not.

              liable for damages and/or spill cleanup? Are they liable in case

            </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The absolute liability provisions in the
              <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> apply to the company that owns the
              pipeline, not landowners or other companies such as incorporated
              farms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, the NEB holds the company that owns the pipeline, and not
              farmers or other parties, responsible for any clean-up costs if
              there is a spill or rupture. The <em>Pipeline Safety Act</em> puts
              in place new measures to help ensure that pipeline companies hold
              enough financial resources to pay these types of costs in the
              event of a spill or rupture.

            <strong>Q19. What does the NEB do to keep pipelines safe? </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The NEB is committed to ensuring pipelines operating in Canada
              remain safe for people and the environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our job starts before a pipeline is even built by reviewing the
              project application to make sure the project is needed and can be
              done safely. But we do not simply make a decision on a project and
              then walk away. We oversee safety for the full lifecycle—from
              construction and operation to the end of its use. We work
              alongside communities with the goal of making energy
              infrastructure the very safest it can be.
            </li>
            <li>
              We know that when companies follow regulations that identify
              hazards and mitigate risk, pipelines remain a safe and reliable
              way to transport oil and gas within Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              We have a number of compliance programs that support our goal of
              zero-incidents.
              <ul>
                <li>Safety Management Program</li>
                <li>Integrity Management Program</li>

                <li>Damage Prevention Program</li>
                <li>Security Program</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Through these programs we hold companies accountable, and identify
              potential issues before they become problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will take every measure to protect people and the environment.
              We have powerful tools to keep companies on track and prevent
              incidents which we will use without hesitation.

              This could include issuing administrative monetary penalties,
              lowering the amount of product a company is allowed to move
              through their pipeline, and shutting a pipeline down completely if
              necessary.

              The NEB actively verifies compliance on all of its authorizations,

            <ul>
              <li>
                In cases of non-compliance, the NEB has a range of tools it can
                use to enforce its decisions, safeguard safety and protect the
                environment. These enforcement tools can range from an oral
                request for immediate compliance to criminal prosecution.

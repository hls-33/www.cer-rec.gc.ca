            These Guidance Notes have been prepared by the Board to bring
            additional clarity to the
            <a
              href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-39/index.html"

              ><em>National Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations</em></a
            >
            (PPR or Regulations) and to provide non-mandatory guidance to assist
            companies in achieving compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guidance Notes are structured for easy use. Sections of the
            Regulations are grouped (where appropriate) under logical headings
            and (where appropriate) the goal of the Regulations (or these
            groupings of different sections of the Regulations) is provided. In
            all cases, this is followed by guidance which provides information
            that may be of use to companies in ensuring the design,
            construction, operation and abandonment of their processing plants
            is carried out in accordance with the Regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Regulations reflect the Board's progression towards the
            development of goal oriented regulations and clearly place the onus
            on companies for ensuring the safety of persons and the protection
            of property and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The actual methods used to meet the specific requirements of the
            Regulations are at the discretion of the company. The onus is on the
            company to maintain adequate records and demonstrate to the Board
            the adequacy and effectiveness of the methods employed to achieve
            compliance.

            An environmental protection program enables a company to
            systematically manage its environmental performance. Program
            components should be developed to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate
            conditions that have the potential to adversely affect the
            environment, therefore managing environmental risk throughout the
            lifecycle of the processing plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            An environmental protection program should define the

            for achieving, reviewing, and maintaining the company's
            environmental performance.

            For guidance in developing an environmental protection program
            companies may use the applicable provisions of the ISO&nbsp;14000
            series of Standards as a reference. Consistent with ISO&nbsp;14000
            principles, an environmental protection program should be embraced
            by employees and driven by senior management.

            Risk analysis is the use of available information to estimate the
            risk, arising from hazards, to individuals or populations, property,
            or the environment. Companies may refer to Appendix&nbsp;G of
            ASME&nbsp;B31.3 for guidance on what could be considered as examples
            of acceptable risk analysis tools. Industry accepted codes,
            regulations or standards may be used to determine the appropriate
            level of fire suppression in conjunction with the assessment of risk
            as described in section&nbsp;22.

            The Board recognizes that construction activities can not take place
            without the introduction of hazards associated with the construction
            and without some impacts on property and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies are required to ensure that construction activities are
            undertaken in a manner which minimizes negative effects on
            personnel, property and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, during construction, companies should ensure that adequate
            environmental mitigative measures are effectively implemented to
            minimize effects on the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, Companies are required to ensure that everyone who may
            be exposed to the elevated risks associated with construction
            activities understands all essential information necessary for their
            personal safety. This is particularly important during commissioning
            operations when hazardous process conditions are first introduced to
            the plant.

          <p>
            In addition, Companies are required to ensure that everyone who may
            be exposed to the elevated risks associated with maintenance
            activities understands all essential information necessary for their
            personal safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies are required to ensure the safety of persons and the
            continued protection of property and the environment during
            operation in the event of hazard alarm or detection device failure
            or deactivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hazard alarms and detection devices should be periodically tested to
            ensure they are functioning correctly. These devices should be
            tested by simulating the event which would normally be detected or
            which would trigger an alarm. Testing frequency should be based upon
            a documented analysis of maintenance routines and risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Procedures should be developed for situations where hazard detection
            alarms or shutdown devices are proposed to be or have been bypassed
            or rendered inoperable. These procedures should include requirements
            for authorization, records and signage. In addition, they should
            contain requirements for documenting and ensuring that other means
            have been employed to achieve an equivalent level of safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Equipment records should be maintained for all devices and could
            include:
          </p>
          <div class="mrgn-lft-md ">
            <p>(a) equipment description;</p>
            <p>(b) model;</p>
            <p>(c) unique identifier; and</p>
            <p>(d) calibration (status, methods, records, etc.).</p>
          </div>
          <p>New equipment should be calibrated and tested prior to use.</p>
          <p>
            Highly visible signage identifying the following information should
            be posted at intervals along the perimeter of the plant as well as
            at the start of access roads and at all gates:
          </p>
          <div class="mrgn-lft-md ">
            <p>(a) name of facility;</p>
            <p>(b) name of owner/operator;</p>
            <p>(c) emergency contact number;</p>
            <p>(d) location (including GPS co-ordinates);</p>
            <p>(e) local contact number;</p>
            <p>(f) no trespassing notification;</p>
            <p>
              (g) hydrogen sulphide/poisonous gas hazard identification (if
              appropriate); and

            <p>(h) name of regulatory authority.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Within the plant appropriate signage should be placed clearly
            identifying hazard(s) in accordance with WHMIS. Signage should be
            placed in consideration of employees as well as for emergency
            personnel who may be called upon to respond to an incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Main emergency shutdown valves should be clearly identified within
            the plant site. Main valves remote from the plant which would be
            used to isolate the plant in the event of an emergency should be
            identified through signage and/or colour coding. Main valves should
            be equipped with position indicators where appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Piping systems may be identified by standard colour coding
            throughout the plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plants should be equipped with appropriate 2-way communications
            equipment and should have well developed communications protocols.
          </p>
          <p>This could include:</p>
          <div class="mrgn-lft-md ">
            <p>(a) intrinsically safe radios for appropriate personnel;</p>
            <p>(b) a plant base station in the control room; and</p>
            <p>
              (c) accessible units at entry points to the plant for use in the
              event of an emergency.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Companies should have procedures in place to maintain and test
            communications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to 2-way communication, plants must be equipped with
            systems for continuously recording plant operating data for later
            analysis in the event of an incident. Where critical information
            pertinent to plant operations may be lost as a result of an
            incident, consideration should be given to having this information
            stored remotely in real time or ensuring the information is
            protected by some other means.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visitors to the plant site must be made aware of all hazards they
            could reasonably encounter while on the plant site. Orientations
            should be documented for all visitors and records should include

          <h4>7.7.2 Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            Deactivation is defined in section&nbsp;1 as meaning &quot;to remove
            temporarily from service&quot;. In practice, it is accepted that
            portions of a plant, though maintained in a deactivated state, may
            never be returned to service, may be maintained in a deactivated
            state for an unspecified length of time, and may ultimately be
            addressed in an application to abandon the operations of the plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deactivation may impose a higher level of risk to the integrity of
            the plant (or systems there-in) depending on the measures specified
            for the maintenance of the deactivated systems or plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deactivation of plants (or systems within plants) may impact
            upstream and downstream users of the plant. Companies proposing
            deactivations could consider using a consultative approach with
            stakeholders similar to that which is used for applications made
            pursuant to section&nbsp;58 of the Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company should notify the Board of any reduction in service
            associated with a deactivation. Where a reduction of service would
            result, the Board may consider the deactivation in accordance with
            sections&nbsp;71 and&nbsp;72 of the Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies are required to notify the Board of any plans for the
            deactivation of the plant (or portions thereof) for 12&nbsp;months
            or more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notification should address all issues arising from the deactivation
            which relate to the protection of property and the environment as
            well as the safety of persons.

          <h4>8.6.2 Guidance</h4>
          <p>
            In order to ensure compliance, companies could develop and maintain
            a mathematical balance for plant operations based on the laws of
            conservation of matter and fluid mechanics which can be used to
            assess the efficiency of systems within the plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Balances should include all inlet streams, product streams and waste
            (including flaring). They should be done at the same frequency as
            would be required if a plant were subject to provincial legislation
            within the province in which the plant is situated but in no case
            should the frequency be less than monthly.
          </p>
          <p>
            All metering for the balance should be performed at the plant.
            Companies should note that balances may be subject to audit by the
            Board and should be retained accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following conditions should be considered in establishing an
            acceptable balance:
          </p>
          <div class="mrgn-lft-md ">
            <p>
              (a) changes in configuration, valving, or flow control during the
              balance period;
            </p>
            <p>
              (b) accuracy of and correction factors applied to the measurement
              equipment used to measure each fluid handled;
            </p>
            <p>(c) physical characteristics of the fluid(s) being measured;</p>
            <p>(d) compressibility of different fluids;</p>
            <p>(e) temperature variations in the process streams;</p>
            <p>(f) flaring;</p>
            <p>(g) volume shrinkage due to losses; and</p>
            <p>(h) disposals.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Unique conditions should be recognised and taken into account in
            establishing an acceptable balance. Acceptable tolerances for the
            balance deviations should be established based on normal operating
            conditions.

          <p>
            Internal compliance audits provide valuable information to the Board
            and to the company. The Board may inspect the data collected from
            these audits for regulatory purposes. Internal audits also allow a
            company to refine training with respect to compliance issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            The frequency of audits should be based upon operations history and
            risk.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Internal Audits</strong></p>
          <p>
            The company may have documented procedures for conducting audits of
            its programs and systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The responsibility for managing audit(s) may be assigned to
            qualified individuals with a knowledge of audit principles and
            techniques and management skills relevant to the activities being
            audited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Audits may be conducted on a regular basis to verify compliance with
            internal programs and systems designed to achieve compliance with
            regulatory requirements and may include:

            An audit report is required and should document findings and
            recommendations (including a plan for implementation of the
            recommendations). The audit report and audit records should be
            retained and should be available to Board auditors upon request.

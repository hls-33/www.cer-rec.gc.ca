            While the NEB may issue authorizations pursuant to

            administer the following processes: land tenure and rights issuance
            (exploration licences, significant discovery licences and production
            licences), royalty management and benefits plans. Applicants should

          <h3 id="s1_1">1.1 The Purpose of the Filing Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            The Filing Requirements for Onshore Drilling Operations Involving
            Hydraulic Fracturing (Filing Requirements) should be used in all
            cases where a proposed work or activity requiring an Operations
            Authorization (OA) involves hydraulic fracturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Filing Requirements outline the information the Board will
            need to assess future applications for drilling that involve
            hydraulic fracturing.<sup id="fn2-rf"

            The Filing Requirements apply to hydraulic fracturing operations in
            the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Filing Requirements focus on the unique elements of hydraulic
            fracturing. The Board expects each applicant to submit the
            information described in the Filing Requirements with its
            application for an OA. Additional information may need to be
            submitted with each subsequent application for an approval, such as
            a Well Approval or Formation Flow Test Approval.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information set out in the Filing Requirements does not prevent
            the Board from requesting any additional information it may find
            relevant, or from waiving certain Filing Requirements if they are
            not relevant to the applied-for work or activities. The applicant is
            responsible for complying with all applicable statutory and
            regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the Filing Requirements should
            be read in association with the COGOA and its regulations<sup

            The Filing Requirements are not static and will be updated
            periodically. The Board is committed to continually improving its
            regulatory process so that its decisions on applications for all
            authorized works or activities regulated under COGOA promote safety,
            protection of the environment and conservation of oil and gas
            resources.

            As part of its environmental protection responsibilities, the NEB
            makes sure that an environmental assessment (EA) is conducted for
            proposed activities in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. The
            NEB conducts its own EA prior to issuing an OA as well as
            coordinating EAs with the northern boards or committees established

          <p>
            The NEB relies on a proponent’s project description to coordinate
            EAs with northern boards and agencies. Accordingly, proponents are
            encouraged to provide a project description to the NEB as early as
            possible. See
            <a href="#s2_2" title="Section 2.2">Section&nbsp;2.2</a> for further
            details.

          <h3 id="s2_1">2.1 Proposed Project Location</h3>
          <p>
            Proposed development projects that occur in the Mackenzie Valley
            require a preliminary environmental screening, EA or review under
            Part&nbsp;5 of the MVRMA. A preliminary screening is conducted by a
            Land and Water Board (LWB). Projects may also be referred to the
            Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board (MVEIRB) which
            carries out EAs and public reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pursuant to the MVRMA, the NEB does not issue an OA until the LWB or
            MVEIRB has issued its decision. The NEB considers the
            recommendations made by the LWB or MVEIRB before it decides, on the
            basis of environmental impact considerations, whether or not the
            proposed work or activities should proceed and, if so, on what terms
            and conditions, including mitigative measures.

            Proposed work and activities that occur in the Inuvialuit Settlement
            Region require an environmental screening or review under the
            <em>Inuvialuit Final Agreement</em>. An environmental screening is
            conducted by the Environmental Impact Screening Committee (EISC).
            Projects may be referred to the Environmental Impact Review Board
            (EIRB) which carries out environmental impact assessments and public
            reviews. Proponents should provide the same information to the NEB
            and EISC or EIRB so that conclusions are based on the review of
            consistent information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, during the EISC or EIRB processes there is extensive
            consultation that ensures local perspectives and issues are
            identified. The IFA addresses the prevention of loss or damage to
            wildlife and habitat and subsequent compensation if there is loss in
            terms of harvesting opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IFA requires the NEB to wait for an EISC or EIRB decision before
            issuing any regulatory authorization. The NEB considers the
            recommendations before it decides, on the basis of environmental
            impact considerations, whether or not the work and activities should
            proceed and, if so, on what terms and conditions, including
            mitigative measures.

            The Nunavut Impact Review Board (NIRB) screens proposed projects in
            the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA) under the
            <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em> to determine whether or not
            an environmental impact review is required. The NEB will keep the
            NIRB updated on the NEB EA process and, although the NIRB may not be
            a party to the EA, the NIRB is able to provide comments during the
            EA process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, for projects located completely outside of the NSA, the
            proponent will provide project information to the NIRB to determine
            if potential trans-boundary impacts would trigger an assessment
            under the NIRB.

            be affected by the proposed project. The extent of consultation
            required for any given application will depend on the nature of the
            project and its scope. The project description should provide the
            results of the consultation conducted and offer sufficient details

                  Hydraulic fracturing typically includes a well-stimulation
                  process in which fluids, proppant and additives are pumped
                  under high pressure into a hydrocarbon-bearing formation. The
                  fluid pressure creates fractures in the formation and the
                  fluid transports the proppant into the fractures. The proppant
                  keeps the fractures open and allows the hydrocarbons to flow
                  from the formation to the wellbore. The additives may: reduce
                  friction, prevent the growth of microorganisms, and inhibit
                  corrosion within the wellbore.

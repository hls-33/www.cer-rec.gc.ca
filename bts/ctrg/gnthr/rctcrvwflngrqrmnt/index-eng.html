          <h2 id="s1">Chapter&nbsp;1 Purpose of filing requirements</h2>
          <p>
            The
            <em
              >National Energy Board Filing Requirements for Offshore Drilling
              in the Canadian Arctic</em
            >
            (Filing Requirements) specify the information to be submitted to the
            National Energy Board (NEB or Board) in support of an application
            for an authorization for offshore drilling activities. The Filing
            Requirements are intended to provide clarity regarding the NEB’s
            expectations for the information to be filed with an application.
            The applicant must demonstrate to the Board that it has complied
            with applicable legislation and regulatory requirements. The Filing
            Requirements should be read in association with the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA) and its
            regulations, particularly the
            <em
              >Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations and
              Guidelines</em
            >
            issued by the NEB regarding these regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB regulates oil and gas exploration and production activities,
            including the drilling of offshore wells in the Canadian Arctic,
            under the COGOA and its regulations<sup id="fn1-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a
              ></sup
            >. The purpose of the COGOA, among other things, is to promote
            safety, protection of the environment, and the conservation of oil
            and gas resources. Land tenure or rights issuance, benefits plans,
            and royalty management are administered by federal government
            departments (Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern
            Development or Department of Natural Resources) and these aspects
            are outside the scope of this document. The reader is referred to
            these departments for information on these matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            An Exploration Licence identifies “where” drilling could take place
            but does not authorize the undertaking of oil and gas exploration
            drilling and production activities (see
            <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em> for details<sup id="fn2-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>2</a
              ></sup
            >). Drilling activities can only take place when the NEB is
            satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated that drilling can take
            place safely while protecting the environment, and can respond
            effectively when things go wrong. Additional Well Approvals would
            also be required under the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Drilling and Production Regulations</em> for
            drilling or changing the condition of a well, formation flow test,
            and co-mingling of multiple reservoir zones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the applicant would need to comply with all acts and
            regulations applicable to the Canadian Arctic offshore. Such acts
            include, but are not limited to:
            <em>Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act</em>;
            <em>Canada Shipping Act</em>; <em>Fisheries Act</em>;
            <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act</em>;
            <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em>; <em>Oceans Act</em>;
            <em>Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act</em> or the
            <em>Inuvialuit Final Agreement</em>; and any act of general
            application.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s11"><em>1.1 Development of the Filing Requirements</em></h3>
          <p>
            The Filing Requirements are based on input received by the Board
            during its Arctic Offshore Drilling Review. Many of the specific
            requirements are derived from the Board’s Calls for Information
            issued during the Review.
          </p>
          <p>
            As explained in our Report,
            <em
              >The past is always present - Review of Offshore Drilling in the
              Canadian Arctic - Preparing for the future</em
            >
            dated December 2011, to determine the scope of the Arctic Review,
            the Board issued a preliminary scope and invited comments on it.
            After considering the comments received, the Board finalized the
            scope and listed 11 elements, including one for Filing Requirements:
            “Information to be required from applicants seeking authorization to
            drill an offshore well”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The outcome of the Arctic Review was made clear from the beginning:
            the results of the Review would be incorporated in the examination,
            by the Board, of future applications for offshore drilling in the
            Arctic. The Arctic Review gathered information and knowledge
            collaboratively to develop the Filing Requirements through
            meaningful engagement and dialogue.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Phase&nbsp;1, the Board gathered information and knowledge from a
            broad range of participants and invited submissions to help build a
            record of best available information with respect to the matters set
            out in the scope. The Board issued two Calls for Information, asking
            questions on the various elements of the scope. The Board also asked
            experts to prepare a number of reports. In addition, the Board held
            numerous open community meetings in the North where people were
            invited to make comments on the information and facts gathered so
            far and, generally, to share their concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Phase&nbsp;2, more public information meetings were held in
            various Northern locations where people could come in and express
            comments on the information collected to date. This led to the
            five-day Roundtable in Inuvik.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Roundtable provided an opportunity for all participants to
            examine and comment on all elements of the scope of the Arctic
            Review, to pose questions, and express their views. People who did
            not attend in person could also provide comments and ask questions
            by telephone. As outlined in the Roundtable agendaand explained by
            the facilitators, the focus of the discussion was information the
            Board should require if an application for offshore drilling in the
            Canadian Arctic is filed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was through this extensive, open, and public information and
            knowledge gathering that the Board developed these Filing
            Requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Filing Requirements specify the information that the Board will need
            to assess future applications for drilling in the Arctic offshore.
            For every application, the Board will determine the information that
            is required to be filed in order to assess that particular project
            on its merits. The information set out in the Filing Requirements
            does not prevent the Board from requesting any additional
            information it may find relevant or from waiving certain Filing
            Requirements if they are not relevant to that project. When a
            proposed project attracts public interest, there would be a process
            to allow participation from the public. People would then have the
            opportunity to ask additional questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Filing Requirements are not a static document. The Board is
            committed to continually improving its regulatory processes and to
            ensuring that its decisions on drilling applications will be made in
            a manner that is safe and protects the environment. The Filing
            Requirements will be updated from time to time. The Board
            understands that as the values and the interests of the public
            evolve over time, so do the Board’s filing expectations of project
            applicants. It is important that the Board communicate these
            expectations so that it has all relevant facts when considering an
            application.

          <h2 id="s2">Chapter&nbsp;2 Environmental assessment</h2>
          <p>
            As part of its environmental protection responsibilities, the NEB
            must ensure that an environmental assessment (EA) is conducted for
            proposed activities in the Canadian Arctic offshore. The NEB
            coordinates EAs with Northern boards and agencies for proposed oil
            and gas projects. The proposed project location determines which
            process is used in conducting the assessment. An EA must be
            completed before a COGOA authorization can be granted.
          </p>
          <p>
            An applicant is encouraged to provide an initial description of the
            project as early as possible in the project planning phase. This
            will help the NEB to efficiently coordinate the EA with Northern
            boards and agencies. Proponents should provide the same information
            to the NEB and Northern boards and agencies so that conclusions are
            based on evaluation of consistent information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The applicant’s project specific EA is to include detailed
            information on: the project development; potential impacts to the
            environment, including potential impacts from accidents and
            malfunctions; consultation with Aboriginal groups and the public;
            socio-economic impacts arising from environmental effects;
            cumulative effects; and mitigation measures to protect the
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For drilling projects that require a COGOA authorization from the
            NEB, the NEB will also conduct its own EA as part of the overall
            decision the Board must make under the COGOA. In this part of the
            assessment, the applicant must submit an Environmental Protection
            Plan (EPP) which includes management of waste. The applicant must
            also submit a Safety Plan and a Contingency Plan which includes
            emergency response procedures. The NEB will expect the applicant to
            agree to make those plans public.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s21"><em>2.1 Project location and regulatory regimes</em></h3>
          <p>
            Depending on where a project is located in the North, a different
            set of legislative and regulatory EA requirements may apply. EA is
            required under federal legislation such as the
            <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act,2012</em>
            (CEAA&nbsp;2012), the<em> Inuvialuit Final Agreement</em> (IFA)

            <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em> (NLCA) Article&nbsp;12 and
            must be completed for exploratory or development projects that
            require an NEB authorization under paragraph 5(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
            COGOA. The reader should refer to the various land claims agreements
            and the CEAA&nbsp;2012 for additional information.

          <h4>CEAA&nbsp;2012</h4>
          <p>
            The CEAA&nbsp;2012 may apply to Arctic offshore drilling projects in
            the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) and projects or portions of
            projects outside of the <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em> area.
            An EA is required under the CEAA&nbsp;2012 if a project is listed in
            the <em>Regulations Designating Physical Activities</em>. These
            “designated” projects include, for example, the drilling, testing
            and abandonment of offshore exploratory wells in the first drilling
            program in an area set out in one or more exploration licenses
            issued in accordance with the
            <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CEAA&nbsp;2012 assessment must take into account the factors
            listed in section&nbsp;19 of the CEAA&nbsp;2012, such as the
            environmental effects of the designated project, including the
            environmental effects of malfunctions or accidents and any
            cumulative environmental effects; comments from the public;
            mitigation measures; and feasible alternative means of carrying out
            the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the responsible authority under the CEAA&nbsp;2012, the NEB must
            ensure that a report is prepared with respect to the EA of a
            designated project and determine whether the project is likely to
            cause significant adverse environmental effects. If the NEB decides
            the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental
            effects, the NEB must refer to the Governor in Council the matter of
            whether those effects are justified in the circumstances. The NEB
            cannot grant an authorization pursuant to paragraph 5(1)(<em>b</em>)
            of the COGOA until a determination has been made pursuant to the
            CEAA&nbsp;2012.

            class="center-block  "
          />
          <p>
            Proposed development projects that occur in the Inuvialuit
            Settlement Region require environmental screening or review under
            the <em>Inuvialuit Final Agreement</em>. An environmental screening
            is conducted by the Environmental Impact Screening Committee (EISC).
            Projects may be referred to the Environmental Impact Review Board
            (EIRB) which carries out environmental impact assessments and public
            reviews. Proponents should provide the same information to the NEB
            and EISC or EIRB so that conclusions are based on the review of
            consistent information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, during the EISC or EIRB processes there is extensive
            consultation that ensures local perspectives and issues are
            identified. The IFA addresses the prevention of loss or damage to
            wildlife and habitat and subsequent compensation if there is loss in
            terms of harvesting opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IFA requires the NEB to wait for an EISC or EIRB decision before
            issuing any regulatory authorization. The NEB considers the
            recommendations before it can decide, on the basis of environmental
            impact considerations, whether or not the development should proceed
            and, if so, on what terms and conditions, including mitigative
            measures.

            The Nunavut Impact Review Board (NIRB) screens proposed projects in
            the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA) under the
            <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em> to determine whether or not
            an environmental impact review is required. Projects or portions of
            projects that are located outside of the NSA are assessed by the
            NEB. The NEB will keep the NIRB updated on the process and, although
            the NIRB may not be a party to the EA, the NIRB is able to provide
            comments during the EA process. Typically, for projects located
            completely outside of the NSA, the proponent will provide project
            information to the NIRB to determine if potential trans-boundary
            effects would trigger an assessment under the NIRB.

            The Board requires the applicant to consult with persons or groups
            who may be affected by the proposed project. The extent of
            consultation required for any given application will depend on the
            nature of the project and its scope. The applicant will be expected
            to justify the consultation carried out for each application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evidence filed in support of an application should reflect the
            outcomes of the consultation process in sufficient detail to
            demonstrate that any concerns raised have been considered and
            addressed as appropriate or, if not, why not.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board expects each applicant to include information on their
            consultation activities to date in the initial project description,
            when applicable. The applicant’s EA should provide the results of
            the consultation conducted up to that point and offer sufficient
            details to justify the extent of that consultation. It should also
            provide a description of plans for future consultation activities
            that will be carried out during the regulatory review and through
            construction, operations and abandonment.

          <h4 id="s223">2.2.3 Socio-economic effects</h4>
          <h5>Context</h5>
          <p>
            The NEB, when conducting an EA under the CEAA&nbsp;2012 and
            assessing an application under the COGOA, considers environmental
            effects, including effects on socio-economic conditions resulting
            from a change in the environment. For example, if a socio-economic
            effect (such as job loss) is caused by a change in the environment
            (such as loss of fish habitat) which is in turn caused by the
            project or a malfunction of the project, then the socio-economic
            effect is an environmental effect within the meaning of the
            CEAA&nbsp;2012. On the other hand, if the socio-economic effect is
            not caused by a change in the environment, but by something else
            related to the project, then the socio-economic effect is not an
            environmental effect within the meaning of the CEAA&nbsp;2012 and
            cannot be considered. The significance of any residual environmental
            effect after mitigation must also be assessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            For projects in the ISR and the NSA, the responsibility for an EA is
            also set out in the <em>Inuvialuit Final Agreement</em> and the
            <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em>. Under these agreements,
            there are provisions intended to prevent loss or damage to wildlife
            and its habitat and to avoid disruption of wildlife harvesting
            activities caused by development. If damage does occur, these
            agreements provide for restoration of wildlife and its habitat, as
            well as compensation for lost harvesting opportunities.

          <p>
            A benefits plan is a plan for the employment of Canadians and for
            providing Canadian manufacturers, consultants, contractors, and
            service companies with a full and fair opportunity to participate on
            a competitive basis in the supply of goods and services used in any
            proposed work or activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the COGOA (section&nbsp;5.2), no approval of a development
            plan nor any authorization of work or activity shall be issued until
            the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development (or the
            Minister of Natural Resources, depending on the location of the
            project) has approved, or waived the requirement of approval of, a
            benefits plan in respect of the work or activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            For additional information on benefits plans and rights management
            see the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development
            website under “Benefits Plan”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB has no role in the approval of, or the waiver of a
            requirement for approval of, a benefits plan, nor the content of
            such a plan. As noted above, the NEB cannot make its regulatory
            decision regarding oil and gas exploration and production activities
            pursuant to the COGOA until the Minister has approved, or waived the
            requirement of approval of, a benefits plan. The NEB focuses solely
            on safety and protection of the environment and does not have a role
            in economic considerations.

          <p>
            The NEB may issue an authorization for each work or activity
            proposed to be carried out. Authorizations may be subject to such
            approvals that the NEB determines. The Operations Authorization and
            the Well Approval are the primary regulatory approvals necessary to
            conduct a drilling program.

          <p>
            Exploration Licences are issued by the Department of Aboriginal
            Affairs and Northern Development for most of the Arctic offshore.
            The Department of Natural Resources is responsible for issuance of
            licenses in Hudson Bay, James Bay, and Hudson Strait. These
            Exploration Licences are issued pursuant to the
            <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em> (sections&nbsp;22&nbsp;to
            27) and confer to the licensee the right to explore for, and the
            exclusive right to drill and test for, petroleum; the exclusive
            right to develop those frontier lands in order to produce petroleum;
            and the exclusive right to obtain Production Licences (subject to
            compliance with other provisions of the
            <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em>). Exploration Licences have
            a maximum term of nine&nbsp;years from the effective date of the
            licence, and shall not be extended or renewed. For additional
            information on rights management see the Department of Aboriginal

          <p>
            The NEB has no role in the issuance of an Exploration Licence. The
            Exploration Licence identifies “where” an applicant may seek
            authorization to undertake drilling activities. The NEB determines
            whether a particular application has adequately demonstrated
            “whether and how” an applicant may drill safely while protecting the
            environment.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the equipment or installation proposed for an oil and gas
              exploration and production activity is fit for the purpose for
              which it is to be used;
            </li>
            <li>
              may be operated safely without posing a threat to persons or to
              the environment in the location and for the time set out in the

            remains in force for as long as the equipment or installation to
            which the certificate relates is used in the work or activity in
            respect of which the authorization is issued. The NEB shall not
            issue an authorization for an oil and gas exploration or production
            activity until it has received from the applicant a certificate
            issued by a certifying authority in the form fixed by the NEB.

          <p>
            “Waste material” is any garbage, refuse, sewage, waste well fluids,

            well, or production operations, including used or surplus drilling
            fluid, drill cuttings, and produced water. Offshore operators are
            expected to take all reasonable measures to minimize the volumes of
            waste materials generated by their operations, and to minimize the
            quantity of substances of potential environmental concern contained
            within these waste materials. No substance should be discharged
            unless the Board has determined that the discharge is acceptable.

          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            Spill Contingency Plans provide emergency response procedures to
            mitigate environmental and safety impacts from unplanned or
            accidental discharges to the environment. Pollution, which includes
            spills, also refers to situations where discharges from authorized
            operations or activities exceed the authorized discharge limits.
          </p>

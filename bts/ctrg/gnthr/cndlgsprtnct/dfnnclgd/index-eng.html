            The National Energy Board (Board or NEB) published the Arctic
            Offshore Drilling Review (Arctic Review) report in
            December&nbsp;2011 after meeting with and engaging northerners,
            environmental groups, industry and other stakeholders. During the
            course of the Arctic Review, the NEB heard that clarity was sought
            on Financial Responsibility requirements for authorized activities
            in all regions covered by the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA).<sup id="fn1-rf"

            The Board is seeking comments on the Draft 1 Viability and Financial
            Responsibility Guidelines (Guidelines) from all interested persons
            until 31&nbsp;October&nbsp;2013.

            The Guidelines will explain the information that an applicant
            seeking an authorization under section&nbsp;5(1)(<em>b</em>) of
            COGOA (Applicant) should provide to the NEB to demonstrate Financial
            Viability with respect to the applied-for activity as well as how it
            will meet the Financial Responsibility requirements pursuant to
            subsection&nbsp;27(1) of COGOA. These concepts are described as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Financial Viability:</strong> the extent to which an
              Applicant is financially capable of conducting the applied-for
              activity safely and in an environmentally responsible manner. The
              Applicant must provide an estimate of the costs of doing so, and
              demonstrate its ability to pay for these costs; and
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Financial Responsibility:</strong> the extent to which an
              Applicant is financially capable of implementing its worst case
              scenario spill contingency plan<sup id="fn2-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"

                ></sup
              >. For the purposes of these Guidelines, the worst case scenario
              is a severe event with extreme and significant effects and
              consequences, as further discussed in Section&nbsp;3. The
              Applicant must provide an estimate of all costs associated with
              control of the incident, clean-up of the environment and
              compensation to affected parties, and demonstrate its ability to
              pay for these costs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3><em>Background</em></h3>
          <p>
            The NEB’s approach to determining Financial Viability and Financial
            Responsibility may be summarized using the diagram below. The
            left-hand side of the diagram addresses the actions that an
            Applicant undertakes to reduce the likelihood and consequence of an
            event occurring, which includes implementing an effective management
            system, and the safety, environmental protection, contingency,
            emergency response plans etc. that support the activity. The
            Applicant must demonstrate that it has sufficient funds available to
            pay for the activity to be completed safely pursuant to all
            regulatory requirements and any commitments and conditions that may
            accompany its application. The right-hand side addresses the actions
            an Applicant would take in response to an event occurring, such as
            stopping the flow of hydrocarbons, implementation of the spill
            contingency plan, containment of the hydrocarbons, clean-up, and
            compensation associated with the event. The Applicant is expected to
            demonstrate that sufficient funds are available to cover both sides
            of the diagram. This means that the Applicant will demonstrate that
            it has the financial resources to execute the activity safely and
            that it has the resources to quickly and effectively address a worst
            case scenario event.

            Companies undertaking oil and gas exploration and production
            activities as well as other authorized activities in areas covered
            by COGOA are liable for the loss or damage that they may cause as a
            result of a spill and debris in accordance with the general laws of
            Canada. COGOA and the Inuvialuit Final Agreement in the Inuvialuit

            subsection&nbsp;5(1)(<em>b</em>) of COGOA (Operator), accountable as
            they impose absolute liability on the Operator. When absolute
            liability is imposed, an Operator cannot avoid liability on the
            basis that there was no fault or negligence. In the case of COGOA,
            this absolute liability is limited to the prescribed amounts found
            in the <em>Oil and Gas Spills and Debris Liability Regulations</em

          <p>
            Prior to receiving an authorization for any oil or gas activity
            onshore or offshore, an Applicant must demonstrate to the Board that
            it is capable of acting in a financially responsible manner for the
            life of the proposed operations. The Board has full discretion over
            the proof of the Financial Responsibility that the Applicant must
            put in place. There is no upper limit on the amount of Financial
            Responsibility which the Board may require.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subsection&nbsp;27(1.1) of COGOA requires the holder of an
            authorization under paragraph&nbsp;5(1)(<em>b</em>) to ensure that
            the proof of financial responsibility remains in force for the
            duration of the work or activity. If there is a draw down on a
            portion of the funds provided to the Board as proof of Financial
            Responsibility, the Board could require an Operator to replenish
            those funds. The Board may suspend or revoke the authorization if
            the Operator fails to maintain proof of Financial Responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of an incident, the Board expects an Operator to clean
            up the spill and debris, as well as pay out all claims as
            appropriate. The Board could take over spill response and pay out
            claims if the Operator does not appropriately address an incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            The liability provisions established under COGOA describe two
            possibilities for those seeking to recover compensation for damage
            and loss from an Operator following an incident. First, the Board
            can hold a security from the Operator and may require that claims be
            paid from this security. Prior to paying out claims, consideration
            would be given to whether any additional claims are likely to be
            submitted, the total amount of any outstanding claims and whether
            the total amount claimed exceeds the specified limit of absolute
            liability. The Board can directly pay out claims without waiting for
            a court to determine fault or negligence. Second, any claim that may
            be made under section&nbsp;26, including any claim that has been
            submitted to the Board, may be sued for and recovered in a court of
            competent jurisdiction in Canada under subsection&nbsp;26(3). There
            is no limit to liability where fault or negligence is established.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB's Chief Conservation Officer can authorize any person to
            take control of the management of the emergency response if the
            Operator is not responding adequately to a spill. The NEB has
            trained emergency management specialists with the expertise to
            evaluate a company’s emergency response activities and, if required,
            take over management of the spill response.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The Applicant will file its Financial Viability and Financial
            Responsibility information at the same time as it files its
            application for an authorization. The Applicant is encouraged to
            contact the NEB to request a pre-application meeting to discuss the
            process requirements for filing the Financial Viability and
            Financial Responsibility information prior to filing an
            authorization application.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of its authorization application, the Applicant will provide
            two separate cost estimates: (1) an estimate for the cost of
            completing the applied-for activity in a safe and environmentally
            responsible manner; and (2) an estimate for the total cost of
            implementing its Spill Contingency Plan for its worst case scenario.
            In addition, the Applicant will provide both an explanation as to
            how these estimated costs were developed and will be covered as well
            as supporting documentation demonstrating the Applicant’s ability to
            pay these costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a minimum, an Applicant is expected to file an application for an
            onshore activity with the Board no less than two months, and an
            application for an offshore activity no less than 6 months, prior to
            the time a decision is requested from the Board. In the case of
            complex applications, additional time may be required. Drafts of any
            financial instruments to be provided such as a letter of credit are
            required prior to the filing of the final instruments. Final
            instruments may be filed with the Board after the Board’s assessment
            of the authorization, but before it is issued.
          </p>
          <h2><em>3. Required Cost Information</em></h2>
          <p>
            In order to determine the level of Financial Viability and Financial
            Responsibility that is required, the Board needs certain cost
            information to address both the prevention of an incident (Financial
            Viability) and the response to an incident, if it were to occur
            (Financial Responsibility). The cost estimate information required
            includes:
          </p>
          <h3>A. To address Financial Viability:</h3>
          <p>
            The Applicant will provide the estimated cost of the applied-for
            activity, including all expenses to be incurred to ensure that the
            activity can be conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible
            manner. In particular, the Applicant is expected to identify the
            cost of all activities included in its operations, including the
            effective implementation of its management system.
          </p>
          <h3>B. To address Financial Responsibility:</h3>
          <p>
            The Applicant will provide the Board with its estimate of the costs
            of implementing its Spill Contingency Plan for its worst case
            scenario. The application must include a description of this
            scenario, the consultation process undertaken to determine it and
            the justification for the choice of scenario. The estimated cost
            associated with implementing its Spill Contingency Plan for its
            worst case scenario should include the cost of:
          </p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph ">
            <li>Containing the incident</li>
            <li>Cleaning up the environment</li>

          </ol>
          <h4><em>a) Cost of Containing the Incident </em></h4>
          <p>
            Containing the incident refers to stopping any flow of hydrocarbons
            into the environment, as well as containing any spill and debris.
            The Applicant should submit information detailing the costs
            associated with containing the incident identified in the worst case
            scenario for which an authorization is being sought. The list of
            factors below is meant to be a starting point for relevant
            considerations, and would be customized for the nature, magnitude,
            and scale of the proposed project. It is intended to be illustrative
            and not exhaustive. The Applicant should consider all factors that
            have a bearing on the worst case scenario costs, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

          <h4><em>b) Cost of Cleaning-Up the Environment</em></h4>
          <p>
            The Applicant should provide the Board with an estimated cost for
            environmental clean-up under the worst case scenario as well as a
            rationale for how those costs were derived. The Applicant should
            consider all factors that have a bearing on the costs of cleaning up
            the environment. The list of factors below is meant to be a starting
            point for relevant considerations and should be customized for the
            nature, magnitude, and scale of the proposed project and is intended

          <h4><em> c) Cost of Compensation</em></h4>
          <p>
            The Applicant will provide the Board with its estimated cost for
            compensating affected third parties in the case of its worst case
            scenario as well as a rationale for how those costs were derived.
            The estimated costs should take into consideration all factors which
            contribute to the cost of compensating third parties from an
            incident. The Board expects the Applicant to engage potentially
            affected third parties when deriving estimates for compensation,
            which may involve the consideration of traditional knowledge. The
            list of factors below is meant to be a starting point for relevant
            considerations and should be customized for the nature, magnitude,

          <h2><em>4. Material Change to the Information Provided</em></h2>
          <p>
            The Operator is expected to file an update when there is a material
            change to the demonstration of Financial Viability or Financial
            Responsibility, such as a change to the estimated cost of the
            applied-for activity, the assessment of risk, the Spill Contingency
            Plan, or the estimated costs of a worst case scenario. If a material
            change is made to any of these factors, the Operator must notify the
            Board in writing immediately upon the change occurring.

          <h2><em>5. Affirmation of Worst Case Scenario Cost Estimates</em></h2>
          <p>
            The Accountable Officer of the Applicant must sign off on the worst
            case scenario cost estimates and verify the accuracy of the
            information filed with the Board in accordance with these
            Guidelines. The Accountable Officer will be the person responsible
            for financial and human resources as well as technical and
            operational activities within the Applicant’s corporation and in
            most cases, this will be the Chief Executive Officer. The Operator
            should notify the Board if the Accountable Officer within a

            safely conducting the applied-for activity can be achieved by
            explaining how the costs for the activity will be paid for over the
            life of the activity. This explanation is expected to be supported
            by the submission of the Applicant’s audited financial statements,
            and the Applicant’s most recent credit rating reports which need to
            be investment grade (B-rating<sup id="fn7-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn7"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>7</a
              ></sup
            >) or above. The audited financial statements and credit rating
            reports of an Applicant’s parent corporation will not be considered
            sufficient. The Board may consider other evidence of Financial
            Viability, in addition to the above, that indicate sufficient
            financial strength and liquidity.

            An Applicant must demonstrate its ability to pay the full cost of
            addressing a worst case scenario.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board will require unfettered access to a portion of the funds
            provided as proof of Financial Responsibility in the form of an
            irrevocable letter of credit. The Board requires the amount of the
            unfettered portion to be equal to or greater than the estimated cost
            of stopping and containing an incident. This does not mean that the
            Board is obligated to use these funds exclusively for the costs
            associated with stopping and containing the event, rather the Board
            may choose to use the funds for any costs associated with the
            incident, including compensation to affected persons.
          </p>
          <p>
            i) Unfettered funds: A financial security with unfettered access
            ensures that the Board will have immediate access to funds, if
            necessary, to address costs resulting from an incident where the
            Operator does not pay for these costs itself. Unfettered funds will
            likely be in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit from a
            Canadian chartered bank, with a Calgary office, indicating the
            beneficiary as “Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada as
            represented by the National Energy Board”. The letter of credit must
            be effective for at least the duration of the authorized activity as
            well as any additional period as directed by the Board. The letter
            of credit can be drawn upon on demand by the Board if an incident
            were to occur. Any letter of credit provided must be unconditional
            and irrevocable, and solely dedicated to providing funds to remedy
            damages and losses from an incident.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the unfettered funds, the Board requires the
            Applicant to carry insurance coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            ii) Insurance: The Board requires the Operator to hold, at a
            minimum, spill and pollution insurance. The Applicant must provide a
            Certificate of Insurance which contains, at a minimum, the
            information set out in the form found at Appendix I as well as
            provide a letter to the Board signed by the Applicant’s Accountable
            Officer indicating:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the name of the insurance carrier</li>
            <li>the amount of the coverage;</li>
            <li>the estimated time required before payout occurs;</li>
            <li>
              that the Applicant has sufficient funds to pay the deductible
              amount,
            </li>
            <li>
              the length of time for which the insurance coverage has been put
              in place;
            </li>
            <li>
              that the Board will be notified at least 60 days in advance if
              insurance will be cancelled or changed;
            </li>
            <li>the listing of all exclusions; and</li>
            <li>
              that the insurance provider has a credit rating of investment
              grade (B-rating<sup id="fn8-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn8"
                  ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>8</a
                ></sup
              >) or above
            </li>
            <li>that each policy names the Board as an insured party</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If an Applicant is covered by more than one insurance policy, then
            in addition to the above requirements, a review of all the combined
            insurance policies must be provided by an independent third party.
            The independent third party must provide verification which
            contains, at a minimum, the information set out in the form found at
            Appendix II.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an Applicant proposes to self-insure instead of using third party
            insurance, the Accountable Officer is required to confirm that
            sufficient funds are and will be available to address the costs of a
            worst case scenario.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the costs of the worst case scenario are not fully covered
            through the unfettered funds and insurance, the Operator must
            provide the remainder of the costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            iii) Other financial instruments: The remainder of the estimated
            worst case scenario costs that are not covered by the irrevocable
            letter of credit or insurance may be addressed through one or more
            of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Additional third-party insurance:</strong> beyond the
              insurance requirement set out in Section&nbsp;7(ii), may be
              provided. The Applicant will provide the Board the specific
              information outlined in section&nbsp;7(ii).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Audited financial statements:</strong> that demonstrate
              the Applicant has sufficient financial strength with adequate cash
              and/or easily accessible capital to cover the costs of a worst
              case scenario. The audited financial statements of the Applicant’s
              parent corporation will not be considered acceptable (unless the
              parent corporation has signed a parental guarantee).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Letter of credit:</strong> an irrevocable letter of credit
              may be provided in addition to the one which comprises the
              unfettered portion of the Financial Responsibility as set out in
              section&nbsp;7(i). The letter of credit must be from a Canadian
              chartered bank, with a Calgary office, and indicate the
              beneficiary as “Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada as
              represented by the National Energy Board.” The letter of credit
              must be effective for the duration of the authorized activity as
              well as any additional period as directed by the Board.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Parental or third party guarantee:</strong> The corporate
              affiliate or parent company can provide the Board with a letter
              indicating that in the event of an incident, the Board would be
              the recipient of sufficient funds from the corporate affiliate or
              parent company to cover the costs of the worst case scenario. This
              letter must be accompanied by audited financial statements and the
              most recent credit rating reports from the parent company or
              corporate affiliate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Industry group fund:</strong> The Applicant may provide
              evidence of participation in an industry group fund that may be
              used to cover the cost of a worst case scenario.
            </li>
            <li>Any other arrangement acceptable to the Board</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Board does not consider surety bonds an acceptable form for
            demonstrating Financial Responsibility.

            The amendments strengthened safety and environmental protection in
            Canada’s offshore oil and gas sector, by modernizing the liability
            and compensation regimes and updating incident preparedness and
            response requirements. The amendments also provide the Boards with
            the authority to issue administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) to
            Operators in the offshore and Northern onshore for enforcement
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            AMPs are penalties that can be imposed by a Board on an individual
            or a company for incidences of non-compliance with legislation,
            regulations, permits, licences, certificate conditions, Board
            officer orders, or Board decisions or orders. AMPs are intended to
            be a compliance-obtaining measure (administrative), as opposed to a
            punitive measure (criminal).
          </p>
          <h3 id="s1_2">1.2 Purpose of the Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            The NEB as well as the C-NLOPB and the CNSOPB have prepared this
            Administrative Monetary Penalty Guideline (Guideline) to provide
            additional information regarding the key elements of the AMP regime
            established under COGOA, the Accord Acts and their respective
            Regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a discrepancy between this Guideline and the
            legislation, the definitions in the Acts and Regulations will
            prevail.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h3 id="s1_4">1.4 Applicability</h3>
          <p>
            The Guidelines apply to all Applicants and Operators in the
            geographic areas set out in the Acts, as applicable. All areas
            regulated under the Acts are collectively referred to hereafter as
            the “Regulated Areas”.

          <p>
            The Boards hold Operators accountable for safety, environmental
            protection and resource management outcomes using a rigorous
            compliance monitoring program and by enforcing legislative
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enforcement actions are the mechanisms used by the Boards to bring
            Operators back into compliance with their respective Acts and
            Regulations, to deter future non-compliance and/or to prevent harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Boards’ objectives for enforcement actions are to achieve
            compliance as quickly and as effectively as possible.<sup

            Achieving compliance eliminates or reduces hazards and protects the
            safety of workers and the public, the environment and property.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Boards will carry out enforcement actions in a manner that is
            fair, predictable and consistent. AMPs are an addition to the
            Boards’ existing enforcement toolkit. In accordance with their
            respective enforcement policies, the Boards will continue to apply
            the most appropriate enforcement tool required to achieve compliance
            and deter future non-compliance. Diagram&nbsp;1 presents an approach
            to using enforcement tools with an emphasis of escalation of
            enforcement from facilitated to directed compliance actions. As
            illustrated below, the AMP could be used in conjunction with any
            other enforcement tool, apart from prosecution, as appropriate.

          <p>
            The Boards may apply one or more of the following criteria to guide
            the use of AMPs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              when compliance is not obtained using either facilitated or

            The application of AMPs will focus on regulatory requirements
            related to safety, protection of the environment and resource
            management. Provisions of the Acts, and subordinate legislation
            listed in Schedule&nbsp;1 of the Regulations, were specifically
            designated as violations subject to a penalty if contravened because
            they pertain to safety, environmental protection or resource
            management. They do not include provisions respecting occupational
            health and safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contravention of an order or decision made under the Acts, as well
            as failure to comply with a term or condition of a certificate,
            licence, authorisation, permit, leave or exemption granted under the
            Acts, are also designated violations subject to an AMP.

          </h4>
          <p>
            The Boards may designate persons or classes of persons who are
            authorized to issue notices of violation (hereafter referred to as
            “Issuer”).<sup id="fn5-rf"

            >
            AMPs will be issued in the form of Notices of Violation (NOVs) from
            the respective Boards’ head office. Issuing NOVs from head office
            will ensure consistency in the respective Board’s use of AMPs and
            adherence to the policies listed in
            <a href="#s2">section&nbsp;2</a> of this Guideline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the Issuer decides to issue an NOV, it will be served on the
            alleged violator. The Regulations require that notices of violation
            and any other documents be served in person, through registered
            mail, courier, fax or other electronic means. Section&nbsp;5 of the
            Regulations provides additional details on service of documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a company or individual commits a violation and receives an
            NOV, the NOV will include the following information:<sup id="fn6-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn6"

            <li>the relevant facts surrounding the violation,</li>
            <li>
              the amount of the penalty, including identification of the

            <li>how to request a review (Request for Review form).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><em>Calculating the Penalty</em></h4>
          <p>
            The calculation of the penalty starts with determination of a
            baseline penalty that can be increased or decreased using a number
            of criteria that are listed in the AMP Regulations. Section&nbsp;4
            of the Regulations lists nine adjustment factors that may be applied
            if the situation warrants, and each factor has different gravity
            values. The sum of all gravity values determines how much the
            penalty can be increased or decreased from the baseline.
            Schedule&nbsp;2 in the Regulations shows the potential gravity
            levels and the corresponding penalty amounts. Note that the baseline
            penalty starts with a gravity level of zero, so if no adjustment
            factors are applicable, the final gravity level would continue to be
            zero and the final penalty amount would correspond to that gravity
            level.
          </p>
          <p>
            The adjustment factors are designed to promote certain behaviours
            such as prompt voluntary reporting, undertaking mitigation
            activities quickly, and taking steps to prevent recurrence of a
            violation. The factors are also intended to deter behaviours such as
            negligence, repeat violations, and financial gain from a violation.
            The complete list of adjustment factors can be found in
            column&nbsp;1 of the table in Section&nbsp;4 of the Regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The violations designated in the Regulations are classified into two
            categories, Type&nbsp;A and Type&nbsp;B. Type&nbsp;A are violations
            of administrative and record-keeping requirements representing a
            lower risk to safety or the environment. Type&nbsp;B includes all
            other violations (the vast majority), such as failing to follow an
            order issued by Board officers or violating safety or environmental
            requirements. A list of violations can be found in Schedule&nbsp;1
            of the Regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            A penalty cannot be increased beyond the maximum daily penalties set
            out in the Acts of $25,000 for individuals and $100,000 for any
            other person (e.g.&nbsp;companies).<sup id="fn7-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn7"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>7</a
              ></sup
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Each day that a violation is committed or continues is considered a
            separate violation for which a separate penalty can be issued.
            Therefore, one non-compliance or incident could result in more than
            one violation. Information contained in the NOV will indicate if the
            violation is one or multi-day violation subject to daily penalties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following two examples illustrate how penalties would be
            calculated using Schedule&nbsp;2 of the Regulations.
            <a href="#t1">Table&nbsp;1</a> summarizes the examples below and
            <a href="#t2">Table&nbsp;2</a> shows the mitigating and aggravating
            factors from the Regulations used in the calculations.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              For an individual who committed a Type&nbsp;A violation, the base
              amount of the penalty (i.e. gravity value of zero) is $1,365
              (Schedule 2 of the Regulations). The individual has provided
              assistance with regard to the violation to the respective Board.
              Therefore a gravity value of -2 was applied to this criterion.
              However, the individual did not promptly report the violation to
              the respective Board (item&nbsp;6) so a gravity level of +1 was
              also applied. The total sum of gravity values is -1. The daily
              penalty, according to Schedule 2 of the Regulations, is therefore
              $990.
            </li>
            <li>
              For any other person (i.e., a company) who committed a Type B
              violation the base amount of the penalty (i.e. gravity value of
              zero) is $40,000 (Schedule&nbsp;2 of the Regulations). The company
              was found to have committed a previous violation so a gravity
              value of +1 was applied to this criterion. The violation was also
              found to have resulted in an increased risk of harm to the
              environment so a gravity value of +2 was applied. The total sum of
              gravity levels is +3, which sets the daily penalty amount for the
              violation at $76,000.

          <h3 id="s4_2">4.2 The Review Process</h3>
          <p>
            If a company or individual does not agree with the NOV they have
            received, they have 30&nbsp;days after the day of service to request
            a review of the amount of the penalty, the facts of the violation or
            both. A company or individual who requests a review is referred to
            as the Requester. A respective Board shall conduct the review or
            designate a person to conduct the review (hereafter referred to as
            “Reviewer”).
          </p>
          <p>
            The review process will be conducted in writing. The Reviewer is not
            involved in the NOV issuance process, which is conducted by the
            Issuer. To request a review, the Requester must fill out the
            “Request for Review” form which will be included with all NOVs. A
            document sent by registered mail or courier is considered to be
            served on the tenth day after the date indicated in the receipt
            issued by the postal service (s.&nbsp;5(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
            Regulations).
          </p>
          <p>
            The form requires the Requester to indicate whether the request is
            for a review of the amount of the penalty, the facts of the
            violation, or both. Depending on the basis of review, the Requester
            will also be required to provide an explanation as to why they
            believe the amount of the violation was not determined in accordance
            with the regulations or why they did not commit the violation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within 21&nbsp;days of receipt of the request, the Reviewer will
            provide the Requester and Issuer with a process letter setting out
            the dates and steps of the review process. As well, within
            30&nbsp;days of receipt of the request, the Issuer will provide the
            Requester with the evidence used to support the NOV. The Requester
            will then have 30 days to provide the Reviewer and the Issuer with
            submissions, including any evidence, to support the request that the
            Reviewer change the amount of the penalty or determine that the
            Requester did not commit the violation. The Issuer has 30&nbsp;days
            to provide a written response to the submission. The Requester will
            then have 30 days from that submission to reply in writing. The
            Reviewer may vary these time limits on its own motion or in response
            to a request as it considers appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            At any time before the Reviewer issues a decision on the review, a
            request to withdraw the review can be made. The Reviewer will review
            all the submissions and make a decision on the request to review.
            The Requester will be sent the Reviewer’s decision, and its reasons
            for decision. The Reviewer’s decision will be posted to the
            respective Board’s external website.

          <p>
            The NOV will include instructions on how to pay the penalty. If, on
            a review, the Reviewer determines that the Requester committed the
            violation, the Requester will be served with a notice of payment
            along with the Reviewer’s decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payments may be made by cheque, money order, bank draft, or by
            electronic funds transfer. As applicable, payments must be made
            payable to Receiver General for Canada for the NEB, the Newfoundland
            Exchequer for the C-NLOPB, the Nova Scotia Minister of Finance for
            the CNSOPB. Additional details on these payment options will be
            provided in the NOV or issued by the respective Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person served with an NOV has 30&nbsp;days from the receipt of an
            NOV to pay the penalty. If a review is requested, payment is
            required within 30&nbsp;days from the receipt of the Notice of
            Payment served along with the Reviewer’s decision. An unpaid AMP
            amount is a debt due to the Crown and may be recovered by collection
            procedures.

          <p>
            In the interest of greater public transparency around the issuance
            of AMPs, a respective Board may post information relating to an NOV
            as soon as it has been served.<sup id="fn10-rf"

            This information may include the name of the company who committed
            the violation, the issue date, the region and facility, the nature
            of the violation, and the amount of the penalty. The decision to
            disclose the name of an individual will be made on a case-by-case
            basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the Boards will post the complete NOV on their
            respective websites after the 30-day review period has expired or
            after the review process has been completed.
          </p>
          <p>The NOV includes the following information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the name of the Operator (or individual, at the discretion of the
              respective Board) that committed the violation,
            </li>
            <li>the relevant facts surrounding the violation, and</li>
            <li>
              the amount of the penalty, including identification of the

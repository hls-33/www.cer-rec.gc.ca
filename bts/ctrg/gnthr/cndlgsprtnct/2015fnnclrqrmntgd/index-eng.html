<h2 id="s1">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="s1_1" class="list-unstyled "><em>Background</em></h3>
<p>In February 2016, new financial requirements will come into force through legislative amendments, as well as new subordinate legislation.</p>
<p>The legislation that will be amended is as follows (collectively referred to hereafter as the “Acts”<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>):</p>
<ul>
<li><em> Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA)</em></li>
<li> <em>Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act (C-NLAAIA)</em></li>
<li><em> Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Newfoundland and Labrador Act (C-NLAAINLA)</em></li>
<li><em> Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act (C-NOSPRAIA)</em></li>
<li><em> Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation (Nova Scotia) Act (CNSOPRAI(NS)A</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>(the latter four&nbsp;Acts are collectively referred to as the “Accord Acts” - references herein are to these statues as amended)</p>
<p>The new subordinate legislation is as follows (collectively referred to hereafter as the “<em>Regulations</em>”):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Financial Requirements Regulations</em></li>
<li><em>Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Financial Requirements Regulations</em> (Federal)</li>
<li><em>Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Financial Requirements Regulations</em> (Provincial)</li>
<li><em>Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Financial Requirements Regulations</em> (Federal)</li>
<li><em>Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Financial Requirements Regulations</em> (Provincial)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Acts and Regulations</em> can be found on the websites of each respective Board:</p>
<p>Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) - <a href="https://www.cnlopb.ca/" rel="external">www.cnlopb.ca/</a></p>
<p>Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) - <a href="https://www.cnsopb.ns.ca/" rel="external">www.cnsopb.ns.ca/</a></p>
<p>National Energy Board (NEB) - <a href="">www.neb-one.gc.ca</a></p>
<p>The amendments, in part, updated and strengthened the liability regime in relation to the drilling for or development or production of petroleum<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> or other petroleum-related work or activities in offshore and certain onshore areas discussed below. The NEB as well as the C-NLOPB and the CNSOPB (both collectively referred to as the Offshore Boards) have prepared the following draft Financial Requirements Guidelines (Guidelines) to provide clarity on the financial requirements set out in <em>COGOA</em>, the <em>Accord Acts</em> and the <em>Regulations</em>.</p>
<h3 id="s1_2" class="list-unstyled "><em>Purpose of the Guidelines</em></h3>
<p>These Guidelines replace the <em>Guidelines Respecting Financial Responsibility Requirements for Work or Activity in the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia Offshore Areas</em> (December&nbsp;2000). While the NEB and the Offshore Boards worked cooperatively to develop the Guidelines, each Board has a unique mandate which is reflected in the Guidelines and attached Appendices.</p>
<p>The Guidelines explain the proof that an Applicant seeking an authorization<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> with respect to each work or activity proposed to be carried on (Authorization) should provide to demonstrate how it meets the financial requirements set out in <em>COGOA</em> or the <em>Accord Acts</em>. The respective Board will assess each application on a case by case basis. These Guidelines may be amended from time to time by the NEB and Offshore Boards as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="s1_3" class="list-unstyled "><em>Definitions</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>Applicant</strong>” - the person seeking an Authorization</li>
<li>“<strong>Incident</strong>” - for the purposes of these Guidelines, the term Incident refers to a spill (the  
discharge, emission or escape of petroleum) or debris<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>4</a></sup></li>
<li>“<strong>Operator</strong>” - the holder of the Authorization and operating licence</li>
<li>“<strong>Investment Policy Statement</strong>” - a document to be provided in relation to the pooled fund which takes into account the potential for immediate and sudden fund withdrawals, and the corresponding high requirement for liquidity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s1_4" class="list-unstyled "><em>Applicability</em></h3>
<p>The Guidelines apply to all Applicants and Operators in the geographic areas set out in <em>COGOA</em> and the <em>Accord Acts</em>, as applicable. All areas regulated under <em>COGOA</em> and the <em>Accord Acts</em> are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Regulated Areas”. Monetary values referenced in this document are in Canadian dollars.</p>
<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2 id="s2">2. Financial Requirements Overview</h2>
<p>Prior to obtaining an Authorization in the Regulated Areas, an Applicant must demonstrate to the respective Board that it is capable of acting in a responsible manner for the life of the proposed work or activity.</p>
<p>The basic objectives of the financial requirements include:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled ">
<li>(a) the Applicant has the ability to respond to an Incident to pay for all actual losses or damages incurred by any person as a result of the Incident, which includes loss of income, future loss of income and, with respect to any Aboriginal peoples of Canada, loss of hunting, fishing and gathering opportunities<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>; and</li>
<li>(b) the payment of any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by any person, including a respective Board.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of an Incident, the respective Board expects the Operator to clean up the spill and debris as well as pay out all claims as appropriate. In the event an Operator fails in these duties, the Acts provide that the respective Board may manage and control that work or activity and take all reasonable measures in relation to the spill and pay out claims for damages as prescribed<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The legislative regime sets out three&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;components of financial requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#s2a">absolute liability</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#s2c">financial resources</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components of financial requirements reflect the polluter pays principle, which is consistent with the notion that liability is unlimited for an Operator who is at fault for an Incident.</p>
<h3 id="s2a"><em>(a) Absolute Liability</em></h3>
<p>Operators undertaking work or activities in relation to the drilling for, or development or production of petroleum, as well as other authorized activities in the Regulated Areas covered by <em>COGOA</em> or the <em>Accord Acts</em>, are liable for the loss or damage that they may cause as a result of an Incident in accordance with <em>COGOA</em>, the <em>Accord Acts</em> and the general laws of Canada. Additionally, <em>COGOA</em>, the <em>Accord Acts</em>, and where applicable the Inuvialuit Final Agreement<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>, hold the Operator accountable as they impose absolute liability on the Operator. Under the absolute liability provisions, an Operator is liable, regardless of negligence or fault, for losses or damages up to certain limits set out in legislation. The absolute liability limits for each Regulated Area are set out in <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s2b"><em>(b) Financial Responsibility</em></h3>
<p>An Applicant must provide proof of financial responsibility. The objective of financial responsibility is to provide the respective Board with funds payable on demand. Given that the intent of financial responsibility is to provide the respective Board readily available access to funds in the event of an Incident where an operator has failed to meet its obligations, the respective Board will require that the financial instruments used to satisfy this objective are sufficiently liquid (set out in further detail in <a href="#s3">Section&nbsp;3</a>) and payable on demand. The following instruments may be acceptable to a respective Board as proof of financial responsibility<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#s3_1">Letter of Credit</a>;</li>

<li><a href="#s3_3">Indemnity Bond</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#s3_4">Proof of participation in a pooled fund (for offshore drilling, development or production activities);</a> and/or,</li>
<li><a href="#s3_5">Any other form that is satisfactory to the respective Board</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of the financial responsibility required by an Applicant for each Regulated Area is set out in <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Operator shall ensure that proof of financial responsibility remains in force for the duration of the work or activity for which the Authorization was issued, or in certain circumstances for a longer period as the respective Board may direct.<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>9</a></sup></strong></p>
<h3 id="s2c"><em>(c) Financial Resources</em></h3>
<p>An Applicant must provide proof that it has the financial resources necessary to pay the absolute liability limit applicable to the work or activity<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>10</a></sup>. The <em>Regulations</em> set out the acceptable forms of financial resources. The <em>Regulations</em> state that an Applicant will provide, to the satisfaction of the respective Board, a Statement of Net Assets or Funding Arrangements more particularly described in <a href="#nnx2">Appendix&nbsp;2</a>. The Statement of Net Assets or Funding Arrangements shall be accompanied by one&nbsp;(1) or more of the following Financial Resource documents (see <a href="#s4_2">Subsection&nbsp;4.2</a> for more detail):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#s4_2a">Most recent audited financial statements and credit rating</a>;</li>

<p><strong><em>A sample bank letter of guarantee</em></strong> is found in <a href="#nnx5">Appendix&nbsp;5</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s3_3">3.3 Indemnity Bond</h3>
<p>A respective Board may consider an indemnity bond as proof of financial responsibility on the condition that it provides the respective Board with funds payable on demand; the funds are sufficiently liquid; and the respective Board is satisfied with the financial capacity and creditworthiness of the guarantor.

<p>An Applicant who is proposing to rely on any other instrument as proof of financial responsibility should notify the respective Board and file the proposed instrument with the respective Board no later than one hundred and twenty&nbsp;(120)&nbsp;days in advance of the anticipated commencement of the Authorization.</p>
<h3 id="s3_5">3.5 Pooled Fund</h3>
<p>An Applicant may provide proof of its participation in a pooled fund<sup id="fn13-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>13</a></sup> only where an Authorization is being sought in connection with the drilling for, or the development or production of, petroleum in one&nbsp;(1) or more of the offshore regulated areas.</p>
<h4>Criteria for the Pooled Fund</h4>
<p>Should the pooled fun meet the following requirements, the respective Board would likely consider it to be satisfactory: </p>
<ul>
<li>Funds must be maintained in a segregated account and not be commingled with the Applicant’s<sup id="fn14-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> general funds;</li>
<li>The administrator of the fund must be an independent, third party;</li>
<li>Funds must be protected from creditors;</li>
<li>Funds must be protected from misuse or use for a purpose other than proof of financial responsibility;</li>
<li>The pooled fund shall only be used for the purpose of meeting the financial responsibility requirements and shall not otherwise be encumbered;</li>
<li>Funds must be liquid and payable to the respective Board within two&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;days of the Board’s demand<sup id="fn15-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn15"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>15</a></sup>;</li>

<li>The pooled fund must be located and administered in Canada;</li>
<li>The pooled fund must identify the offshore regulated area(s) for which it applies.

<li>The Applicant shall provide a certificate from the administrator stating that the pooled fund satisfies the requirements set out in the respective <em>Acts and Regulations</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monies in the pooled fund must be invested pursuant to an Investment Policy Statement which takes into account the potential for immediate and sudden fund withdrawals, and the corresponding high requirement for liquidity. The Investment Policy Statement, which must be filed with and accepted by the respective Board, must appropriately reflect this reality by allowing only liquid, high quality, low volatility investments. The Investment Policy Statement must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statement of goals and objectives;</li>
<li>Description of pooled fund management, in particular the delegation of trading limits to individuals and/or external advisors;</li>
<li>Procedures for valuation of pooled fund investments independent of the portfolio management and trading functions;</li>
<li>Procedures for reporting daily pooled fund value and limit breaches;</li>

<li>Maturity limits for money market and fixed income positions;</li>
<li>Concentration limits for each issuer; and,</li>
<li>Maximum portfolio duration.</li>
</ul>
<p>An acceptable Investment Policy will typically limit pooled fund investments to Canadian dollars, and treasury bills up to ninety&nbsp;(90)&nbsp;days’ maturity issued by the Government of Canada or a Canadian province. A respective Board may consider an Investment Policy that allows for additional investments, at its discretion; however, a more complex pooled fund portfolio will require an expanded Investment Policy.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the administrator to<sup id="fn16-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>16</a></sup>:</p>

<li>ii. notify the respective Board(s) within twenty-four (24)&nbsp;hours of any change to the participants in the pooled fund or of any change in the amount of the pooled fund, other than one that is solely attributable to an interest charge or a banking fee;</li>
<li>iii. notify the respective Board(s) of a contravention by a participant in the pooled fund of their obligation under the Act(s)<sup id="fn17-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn17"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>17</a></sup> within 24&nbsp;hours of becoming  aware of the contravention; and,</li>
<li>iv. provide the respective Board(s) with the phone number, email address and mailing address of the administrator of the pooled fund.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Where a payment is made from the pooled fund to a respective Board, the Operator shall reimburse the pooled fund in the amount that is paid out of that fund, within seven&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;days after the date in which such payment is made<sup id="fn18-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn18"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>18</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="s3_6">3.6 Limitations</h3>
<p>An Applicant cannot rely on one instrument valued solely at $100&nbsp;million as proof of financial responsibility in support of multiple Authorizations. Nevertheless, on a case by case basis, there may be circumstances where a respective Board may permit an Applicant to use that same instrument as proof for other activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, a respective Board could accept a single instrument from the Applicant in a combined value in support of multiple Authorizations for drilling, production or development. For example, where there are two&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Authorizations for drilling, production or development, the respective Board may accept a single instrument in the amount of $200&nbsp;million.</p>

<p>As discussed in <a href="#s6_2">Section&nbsp;6.2</a>, if an Applicant wishes any of the respective Boards to consider an amount of financial resources or financial responsibility less than those listed in <a href="#nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1</a>, the Applicant must provide a risk assessment that demonstrates that the potential loss or damage that could occur would be less than the absolute liability amount. Alternatively, the respective Board could require the Applicant to provide a risk assessment for the purposes of its consideration under <a href="#s6_1">Section&nbsp;6.1</a>. The Applicant should consider the following three categories, as applicable, when completing its risk assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li>cost of containing the Incident;</li>
<li>cost of cleaning up the environment; and,</li>
<li>cost of compensating affected third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of factors below is meant to be a starting point for relevant considerations and should be customized for the nature, magnitude, and scale of the proposed work or activity. The list is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed costs estimates for stopping any flow of hydrocarbons into the environment as well as containing any spill or debris;</li>
<li>The well, i.e. Exploration, Delineation or Development and the expected hydrocarbon type(s), e.g. oil, natural gas, condensate;</li>
<li>Information on expected well pressures and temperatures;</li>
<li>Any special oversight measures relating to the activity;</li>
<li>Consider the type, scale, timing, and location of the proposed activity and the marine installation or structure and equipment involved, including any subsea infrastructure;</li>
<li>Key response strategies and methods for spill containment and debris removal, monitoring, tracking recovery, and clean-up on surface water, the subsurface, shoreline, ice, and ice-infested waters, as applicable;</li>
<li>Information on resulting impacts to navigation and potential navigation hazards;</li>
<li>Information respecting water depth, sea floor formation and subsea hazards;</li>
<li>The rates of release, volume and properties of the product that could be released in the event of an Incident;</li>
<li>Required support systems, including vessels and ice-breakers;</li>
<li>All factors that can cause harm to the proposed activities, and how such risk factors could be managed;</li>
<li>Environmental, logistic, and geographic factors that affect stopping, containing and cleaning up the released product;</li>
<li>Provide an estimate for environmental clean-up of Incidents that could occur as well as a rationale for how those costs were derived;</li>
<li>Spill fluid characteristics (physical and chemical properties such as flow rates, volume, oil properties such as API<sup id="fn29-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn29"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>29</a></sup> gravity, grade, viscosity, hydrocarbons constituent components, and wax content);</li>
<li>Physical environment of the event (e.g., onshore or offshore, water depth, surface or sub-surface spill and debris, presence and make-up of ice, currents, waves, time of year, air temperature, and periods of low visibility such as during foggy conditions and at night);</li>
<li>Effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed spill countermeasures in the operations time period (and possibly beyond the season as spill and debris clean-up may continue after the end of an effective operating period);</li>
<li>Availability of suitable infrastructure, skilled and capable personnel, and adequate and appropriate equipment;</li>
<li>Spill monitoring and spill trajectory models for effective deployment of spill countermeasures;</li>
<li>Information on ecological, cultural, traditional use, commercial, and other significant areas or sites;</li>
<li>Estimates of the cost for compensating potential third parties in the event of an Incident;</li>
<li>Proximity of the authorized activities to communities and fishing areas;</li>
<li>Extent of Aboriginal peoples’ dependence on fishing or, for onshore NEB applications, hunting, traditional lifestyle and livelihood; and,</li>
<li>Loss of Aboriginal peoples’ actual and future income generated from fishing and, for onshore NEB applications, hunting and gathering (actual loss or damage does not include loss of income recoverable under subsection&nbsp;42(3) of the <em>Fisheries Act</em>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>National Energy Board</h4>
<p>In addition to the list above, a risk assessment for the National Energy Board should include the following, as applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discussion of whether additional security is being held by another governmental organization (if so provide details);</li>
<li>Value of the land to the cultural aspects of the northern people and communities;</li>
<li>Obligations and responsibilities under land claim settlement agreements; and,</li>
<li>Cost to replace a community’s water and food sources/intakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s7">7. Extended Obligation</h2>
<p>For Authorizations respecting the offshore drilling for, or development or production of petroleum, proof of financial responsibility and of financial resources must remain in force for a period of one&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;year beginning on the day on which the respective Board notifies the Operator that it has accepted a report submitted by the Operator indicating the date the last well is abandoned (the respective Board may reduce that period and it may further decide to lessen the amount of financial responsibility and proof of financial resources that are in place for that Operator during that period)<sup id="fn30-rf"><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn30"><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>30</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2 id="s8">8. Decommissioning and Abandonment of a Development</h2>
<p>The financial requirements for the decommissioning and abandonment of a development and associated infrastructure will be determined on a case by case basis. An application by an Operator may include the following information as applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>the projected cost associated with the decommissioning and abandonment of the development;</li>
<li>the manner and form in which the Operator will ensure that the decommissioning and abandonment costs will be paid;</li>
<li>in the event that entire removal is not required, the manner, form and costs associated with maintaining the decommissioned production installation;</li>
<li>the manner and form in which any post abandonment event will be dealt with by the Operator in the event of any subsequent claims, such as damages attributable to the Operator’s work or activity, that arise after the decommissioning and abandonment occurs; and,</li>
<li>such other information as the respective Board may consider necessary.</li>
</ul>
<div class="cn-toppage pull-right mrgn-rght-md mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"><a href="#wb-tphp">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2 id="s9">9. Submission of Proof and Approval</h2>
<p>The process for filing the proof of the necessary financial requirements and for seeking approval of the financial requirements by each respective Board can be found in <a href="#nnx10">Appendix 10</a>.</p>
<p>Once preliminary matters, as set out in <a href="#nnx10">Appendix 10</a>, have been dealt with, the Applicant must submit to the respective Board, the draft documentation which evidences the required proof of financial requirements. For the Offshore Boards this is done using the Proof of Financial Requirements for Work Authorization form, attached hereto as <a href="#nnx11">Appendix 11</a>. For the NEB, this is done by way of a letter addressed to NEB contact listed <a href="#nnx3">Appendix 3</a>. <strong>THIS SUBMISSION SHOULD BE MADE IN A TIMELY MANNER SUFFICIENTLY IN ADVANCE AND NO LATER THAN SIXTY&nbsp;(60)&nbsp;DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE ANTICIPATED COMMENCEMENT OF THE AUTHORIZATION. In the event that the proof is an indemnity bond, SECURITY BOND, PLEDGE AGREEMENT, OR SURETYSHIP AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER FORMS OF PROOF FOR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, THE SUBMISSION SHOULD BE NO LATER THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY&nbsp;(120)&nbsp;DAYS IN ADVANCE.</strong></p>
<p>Following submission of the required documentation, a respective Board will determine whether the submitted documentation is acceptable, and when necessary may request further information from the Applicant. Where appropriate, a respective Board may require further conditions of approval.</p>
<p><strong>AN AUTHORIZATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED UNTIL THE NECESSARY PROOF OF FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND THE SUBMITTED INFORMATION IS SATISFACTORY TO THE RESPECTIVE BOARD.</strong></p>

<h3 id="nnx1">Appendix&nbsp;1 - Financial Requirements for Each Respective Board</h3>
<h4>National Energy Board </h4>
<p>The onshore and offshore charts set out the most commonly applied for Authorizations. The NEB has provided a general range of the amount of financial responsibility and financial resources that it is likely to require for each activity. While the ranges set out below will provide Applicants with more certainty as to the NEB’s expectations, each application will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis. Subject to <em>COGOA</em>, the NEB may increase or decrease the financial resource or responsibility requirements set out below, depending on the specific facts and scope of each application.</p>
<p>The list below is meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive. Applicants that are applying for an Authorization for an activity that is not listed below are encouraged to contact the NEB to request a pre-application meeting to discuss the process requirements for filing the necessary proof of financial resources and financial responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>NEB</strong></p>
<p>An Applicant is encouraged to contact the NEB to request a pre-application meeting to discuss the process requirements for filing financial requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Offshore Boards</strong></p>
<p>The following preliminary procedures should be undertaken by an Applicant before the proof of financial requirements is formally submitted. The most effective way of achieving this would be to meet, if possible, with the appropriate representatives of the respective offshore Board:</p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<ol class="list-unstyled ">
<li>(a) Notify the respective Offshore Board of the specific representative(s) who, on the Applicant’s behalf, will deal directly with matters respecting financial requirements; </li>
<li>(b) Notify a respective Offshore Board if the Applicant will not solely be providing proof but instead providing proportionate shares from other partners/interest holders. In such circumstances the Applicant shall be the sole point of contact with that Board for matters relating to financial requirements;</li>
<li>(c) Inform the respective Offshore Board of the Applicant’s preference respecting the form, substance and arrangements for the required proof of financial requirements, having regard to the information and requirements provided herein. This presents an opportunity for a respective Board and the Applicant to discuss any potential deficiencies or irregularities and to address particular requirements before the documentation providing such proof of financial requirements is finalized; </li>
<li>(d) Inform the respective Offshore Board that it will be providing proof of its participation in a pooled fund; and</li>
<li>(e) Where possible provide a respective Offshore Board with draft proof for review and comment before submitting the signed originals to the respective offshore Board.</li>

            public, and the environment. With the passing of the
            <em>Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act</em>, the NEB was
            provided with authority to establish a system of Administrative
            Monetary Penalties (AMPs) through regulations to promote compliance
            with the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act).
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of AMPs is to encourage compliance, deter future
            non-compliance, and prevent harm, with a focus on ensuring the
            safety of workers and the public, and the protection of the
            environment.

            <strong>2. What are the key elements of this regulation?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations</em> (AMP
            Regulations) establish two types of violations and set a baseline
            penalty for each category. The baseline penalty is determined based
            on the type of violation and whether the violation is committed by
            an individual or company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new AMP sections in the NEB Act set out the maximum daily
            penalties for both individuals and companies. For individuals the
            maximum daily penalty is $25,000 for each violation, and for
            companies the maximum daily penalty is $100,000 per violation. The
            NEB Act stipulates that <em>each day</em> that a violation continues
            is considered to be a <em>separate</em> violation. This means that
            separate penalties could be issued per infraction, per day with no
            maximum total financial penalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the details of the AMPs are described in the amendments to
            the NEB Act. Other details, such as what activities will be
            considered violations, are written in the new regulations.

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            AMPs are financial penalties the Board has the ability to impose on
            companies or individuals for non-compliance with the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em>, regulations, decisions, permits,
            orders, licenses or certificate conditions.

          <p>There is no limit.</p>

              >5. What sorts of violations would lead to penalties?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The AMP Regulations designate the provisions in the NEB Act or its
            regulations that are intended to encourage safety and environmental
            protection as violations that could be subject to financial penalty.
            Schedule&nbsp;1 of the AMP Regulations list these sections of the
            NEB Act and its regulations that are designated as violations and
            could be subject to an AMP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contravention of an order or decision made under the NEB Act, as
            well as failure to comply with a term or condition of a certificate,
            licence, permit, leave or exemption granted under the NEB Act, is
            also designated as a violation that could be subject to an AMP.
          </p>
          <p><strong>6. Can the penalties be adjusted?</strong></p>
          <p>
            The AMP Regulations establish two types of violations (Type&nbsp;A
            and Type&nbsp;B), and set a baseline penalty for each category. The
            baseline penalty is determined based on the type of violation (A or
            B) and who committed the violation (individual or company).
          </p>
          <p>
            The baseline penalty can be adjusted by applying, if circumstances
            warrant, aggravating and mitigating factors that are set out in the
            regulations. These factors allow the gravity level to be increased
            or decreased from zero (the baseline penalty starts with a gravity
            level of zero). Each gravity level has a corresponding penalty
            amount that is listed in Schedule 2 of the AMP Regulations. If no
            adjustment factors are applied, the final gravity level will remain
            zero and the final penalty will be the baseline penalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The baseline penalty may be adjusted using the following factors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The history of violations committed within the previous
              7&nbsp;years
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether any competitive or economic benefit was derived from the
              violation
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether the parties to the violation made any effort to mitigate
              or reverse the effects of the violation
            </li>
            <li>
              Cooperation with the Board in their incident response,
              investigation and mitigation of the violation
            </li>
            <li>Any steps taken to prevent reoccurrence of the violation</li>
            <li>
              Whether the violation was primarily a reporting or record-keeping
              requirement
            </li>
            <li>Any other factor considered relevant</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Violators are required to pay any penalties in full.</p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >7. What if an incident occurred before AMPs came into effect on
              3&nbsp;July&nbsp;2013?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Any incident on an NEB-regulated pipeline or facility is subject to
            a timely and appropriate response and investigation. In addition to
            this, the NEB will consider using everything available to us in our
            compliance and enforcement toolkit. These tools include inspection
            officer orders to eliminate immediate threats to the environmental
            and safety, Board orders that restrict the operations of a pipeline
            to reduce risk, and revoking a company's authorization to operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be noted that certain violations, such as contravention of
            Board and Inspection Officer orders regarding safety and
            environmental protection, are criminal offences and, upon
            conviction, are subject to fines and imprisonment as set out in the
            Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, breach of an Inspection Officer order is subject on
            indictment to a fine of up to one&nbsp;million&nbsp;dollars,
            imprisonment for up to five&nbsp;years, or&nbsp;both.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>8. What will be the Board’s approach to using AMPs?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB will consider the following criteria to guide the use of
            AMPs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              when <strong>compliance is not obtained</strong> using either
              facilitated or directed compliance tools
            </li>
            <li>
              when <strong>harm is caused</strong> because of the non-compliance
            </li>
            <li>
              when <strong>harm would likely occur</strong> because of the
              non-compliance
            </li>
            <li>
              any other situation where an AMP is considered to be the best way
              to obtain compliance or deter future non-compliance
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>9. What is the timeline for implementation?</strong></p>
          <p>These regulations came into force on 3&nbsp;July&nbsp;2013.</p>

            Companies are responsible for meeting the requirements of the OPR to
            manage safety, security and environmental protection throughout the
            entire lifecycle of their facilities, from design, through to
            construction, operation and abandonment.
          </p>
          <p>
            As required by the OPR, companies must establish, implement and
            maintain management systems and protection programs in order to
            anticipate, prevent, manage and mitigate conditions that may
            adversely affect the safety and security of the company’s pipelines,
            employees, the public, as well as property and the environment. A
            company’s management system applies to the company’s programs for
            safety, pipeline integrity, environmental protection, emergency
            management and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            When requested by the National Energy Board, companies must
            demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of the management
            processes and procedures employed.

          </p>
          <p><strong>1. What is the purpose of this regulation?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Together with the <em>Export and Import Reporting Regulations</em>,
            the <em>Toll Information Regulations</em> provide the National
            Energy Board (NEB or the Board) with information necessary to
            understand the functioning of the energy markets in Canada, so that
            Board oversight adapts to the evolving energy markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information on traffic, including throughput, is essential to the
            Board as it is an important indicator of the health of a pipeline,
            including the company’s ability to maintain and abandon its
            pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. What are the key elements of this regulation?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Toll Information Regulations</em> require pipeline companies
            that charge tolls to submit to the Board on a quarterly basis
            information on traffic, including export volumes, capital, revenues,
            expenses and rates of return. The <em>Filing Manual</em> provides
            more specific guidance on the information to be filed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >3. How does this regulation affect Canadian businesses?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            A pipeline company that charges tolls must file the information as
            required, and make the information available to their shippers.
            Their shippers use this information to evaluate whether they are
            being fairly charged for services provided. Where they have
            concerns, the shippers can ask the Board to consider a complaint.
          </p>
          <p><strong>4. What is the timeline for implementation?</strong></p>
          <p>This regulation is in force.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Where can I get more information?</strong></p>

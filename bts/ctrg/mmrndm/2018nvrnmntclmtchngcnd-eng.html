<p class="h1 text-center">Annex&nbsp;“A”</p>
<p class="h1 text-center"> Environmental Emergency Management</p>
<p>This annex is governed by the understanding as described in the MOU between ECCC and the NEB.</p>
<h2>1.0 Purpose</h2>
<p>As per paragraph&nbsp;2.3.1 Emergency Management, the purpose of this annex is to provide additional information related to how the Participants will share information and cooperate in areas related to environmental emergencies, including incidents associated with NEB-regulated facilities. This includes the Participants’ roles within the incident management system and exchanges of information and collaboration on scientific needs arising as the result of emergency situations that have, or potentially will, impact the environment and/or human health.</p>
<h2>2.0 Definitions </h2>
<p><strong>Lead Federal Regulatory Agency (Lead Agency)</strong></p>
<p>The federal agency, with primary jurisdiction, that oversees the response and recovery efforts by the responsible party.</p>
<p>The NEB is identified as lead agency for pollution incidents originating from NEB-regulated facilities and activities including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interprovincial and international pipelines; and</li>
<li>Exploration and drilling for, the production, conservation, processing and transportation of petroleum in the non-Accord frontier offshore areas and, the onshore Northwest Territories portion of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.</li>
</ul>
<p>ECCC is identified as lead agency when ECCC has authority and where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spill has been caused by a federal department or agency on their own property, or</li>
<li>An agency is not capable or willing to act as a lead agency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>National Environmental Emergencies Centre (NEEC) </strong></p>
<p>The NEEC is ECCC’s 24/7 focal point for the provision of scientific and technical advice during an emergency to inform actions that reduce the consequences of environmental emergencies and monitor that the measures required under the law are being taken to protect the environment. In the event of a spill where the Canada-US Joint Inland Pollution Contingency Plan is activated, NEEC coordinates with the U.S Environmental Protection Agency the binational concept of operations.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Emergencies Science Table (Science Table) </strong></p>
<p>The Science Table is a NEEC-chaired group of relevant experts in the field of environmental protection that may be activated during an environmental emergency response. Science Table participants identify environmental protection priorities, potentially impacted federal, provincial and territorial legislation and mandates and inform actions that reduce the consequences of environmental emergencies. The Science Table is activated when required by NEEC, or when requested by the Lead Agency, in order to ensure potentially impacted members with legislation and/or mandate are fully briefed on the incident and assistance is needed to ensure all potential environmental resources at risk and legislation are identified.</p>
<p><strong> National Energy Board Emergency Operations Centre (NEB EOC) </strong></p>
<p>The NEB facility located in Calgary is responsible for supporting the field incident management team and assessing actions at a strategic level during an incident. The EOC provides situation reports to the Government of Canada’s Emergency Operations Centre in Ottawa.</p>
<p><strong>Environment and Climate Change Canada National Environmental Emergency Operations Centre (ECCC NEEOC) </strong></p>
<p>The ECCC’s–NEEC office located in Montreal, QC is responsible for the provision of scientific and technical advice during an emergency, supporting staff that are or will be deployed to the incident, and meeting the departmental strategic needs.</p>
<p><strong>Incident Command System (ICS) </strong></p>
<p>ICS is a standardized on-site management system used during an emergency designed to enable effective, efficient incident management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational structure. The system brings together the functions of the federal and provincial governments, local authorities and governments, and the responsible party.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC)</strong></p>
<p>The SSC is ECCC’s principal advisor to monitor that the incident response required under the law is being provided and to coordinate delivery of ECCC’s products and services. The Scientific Support Coordinator provides intelligence, scientific and technical advice to the NEB Incident Command at Command Staff level.</p>
<h3>3.0 General Areas of Cooperation Related to Emergency Management</h3>
<ol class="list-unstyled lst-spcd mrgn-lft-md">
<li>3.1 The Participants will coordinate activities by participating in and sharing information on emergency management planning, exercises and response, joint training initiatives, staff exchanges, and meetings.</li>
<li>3.2 The Participants concur that in an emergency response situation, they may call upon one another to provide support in the form of staff and technical resources. The Participants will use their best efforts to provide the requested resources.</li>
</ol>
<h2>4.0 Specific Areas of Cooperation during an Emergency</h2>
<p><strong>4.1 Scientific and Technical Support</strong></p>
<p>The NEB may request scientific and technical support from the NEEC in areas within ECCC’s mandate, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommended actions to reduce the consequences on the environment and human life or health;</li>
<li>Advise on mitigation and cleanup measures;</li>
<li>The physical and chemical properties of various substances which may be toxic and/or harmful to the environment and their fate and effects;</li>
<li>Physical, chemical and toxicological laboratory analysis of samples;</li>
<li>Assistance with the design of sampling plans and methods to be used to monitor an ongoing incident as well as to assess the overall impact of an incident on the environment;</li>
<li>Potential effects to environmental components of the receiving environment;</li>
<li>Identification of resources at risk through stakeholder engagement and/or  provision of environmental sensitivity mapping products;</li>
<li>Advice on the protection of sensitive ecosystems and wildlife (e.g., migratory birds);</li>
<li>The provision of weather forecasts and warnings; atmospheric and hydrologic trajectory and dispersion modeling; and other hydro-meteorological related services (e.g., ice and iceberg  of satellite tracking of pollution in the marine environment</li>
<li>Expertise regarding Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Techniques (SCAT), clean up methods, endpoints;</li>
<li>The use of countermeasures (e.g., spill treating agents) and the net environmental benefit associated with their use; and</li>
<li>Regulatory requirements regarding ECCC’s legislation, which may be impacted by an environmental emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>ECCC may request scientific and technical support from the NEB in the following areas within the NEB’s mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency response activities related to oil and gas facilities;</li>
<li>Characteristics and information on petroleum products transported, including support in obtaining product samples, when required;</li>
<li>Design and engineering of oil and gas facilities; and</li>
<li>Regulatory requirements related to NEB-regulated facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.2 Incident Management System</strong></p>
<p>The Participants will integrate within the lead agency’s incident management system in an emergency response situation. The NEB and most of its regulated companies use the ICS.</p>
<p>In the event that the NEB is the lead agency for response purposes and it requests participation by NEEC, ECCC staff will integrate into the ICS as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SSC, the primary position filled by ECCC, will report directly to the NEB’s on-site incident commander as part of the Command Staff for the incident. </li>
<li>ECCC could take on other roles within the incident management team as needed based on capacity, (e.g. Technical Specialists and Field Observers); and</li>
<li>In the event that the NEB’s EOC requires technical support from the NEEC, it will provide technical assistance directly to the EOC. This could be accomplished remotely or in-person.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that ECCC is the lead agency for response purposes and it requests participation by NEB Staff, NEB staff will integrate into the ICS as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primarily as Technical Specialists, as needed, or in other ICS positions, as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that the ICS is not the incident management system used during an emergency, the Participants will agree amongst themselves as to the roles that each of the participants will play within the incident management system.</p>
<h2>5.0 Sharing Pollution Reporting Information</h2>
<p>In the event of an emergency, the Participants will share information reported by polluters under relevant pollution reporting legislation.</p>
<p>Under law, all polluters under the Fisheries Act or the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 must notify authorities when a spill of hazardous substances occurs.</p>
<p>The NEB requires all companies that it regulates to report all pollution incidents to the Online Event Reporting System (OERS) or to the Transportation Safety Board which in turn, notifies the NEB On-Call Responder.</p>
<h2>6.0 General</h2>
<p>This Appendix will commence and take effect upon the date of the last participant’s signature of the MOU.</p>
<h2>7.0 Administration of this Annex:</h2>
<p>The following are the titles of each designate and their contact information for the purposes of carrying out this Annex:</p>

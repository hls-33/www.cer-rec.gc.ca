            the environment from the significant adverse impacts of proposed
            developments, and to the protection of the existing and future
            social, cultural and economic well-being of residents and
            communities.
          </p>

            Annex&nbsp;1 to this Schedule.
          </p>
          <h4>4.2 Conduct of the Environmental Impact Review</h4>
          <h5>Rules of Procedure</h5>
          <p>
            The Parties will submit rules of procedure to the Joint Review Panel
            concurrent with the execution of this Agreement. The conduct of the
            environmental impact review will be governed by the Joint Review
            Panel rules of procedure.
          </p>
          <h5>Public Participation</h5>
          <p>
            The Joint Review Panel will conduct its review in a manner that will
            promote and facilitate public participation and ensure that the
            concerns of aboriginal people and the general public are taken into
            account in that process.
          </p>
          <h5>Public Information</h5>
          <p>
            All information received during the conduct of the environmental
            impact review of the EIS will be placed on the public registry.
          </p>
          <h4>4.3 EIS Terms of Reference</h4>
          <p>
            The Parties will issue, concurrent with the execution of this
            Agreement, Terms of Reference for the Environmental Impact Statement
            (EIS). The Proponents will prepare an EIS in accordance with the
            Terms of Reference and submit the EIS to the Joint Review Panel.

          <p>
            The Joint Review Panel will expeditiously conduct a conformity check
            to determine whether the EIS contains sufficient information to
            proceed to the technical analysis. If the Joint Review Panel
            determines that the EIS does not contain sufficient information, it
            will issue instructions to the Proponents for the submission of the
            additional information.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            The Environmental Impact Review will have regard to the protection
            of the existing and future social, cultural and economic well-being
            of residents and communities and will include a consideration of the
            following factors:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The impact of the Project on the environment, including the impact
              of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the
              Project and any cumulative impact that is likely to result from
              the Project in combination with other projects or activities that
              have been or will be carried out;
            </li>
            <li>The significance of any such impact;</li>
            <li>
              Any comments from the public that are received during the
              Environmental Impact Review;
            </li>
            <li>
              Measures that are technically and economically feasible and that
              would mitigate any significant adverse impact of the Project on
              the environment;
            </li>
            <li>The purpose of the Project;</li>

            <li>Alternatives to the Project;</li>
            <li>
              Alternative means of carrying out the Project that are technically
              and economically feasible and the impact on the environment of any
              such alternative means;
            </li>
            <li>
              The need for any follow-up program in respect of the Project, and
              the requirements of such a program;
            </li>
            <li>
              The capacity of renewable resources that are likely to be
              significantly affected by the Project to meet existing and future
              needs;
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Terms and conditions relating to mitigation measures that would be
              necessary to minimize any negative impact on wildlife harvesting,
              as referred to in paragraph&nbsp;13(11)(a) of the IFA, including,
              as far as is practicable, measures to restore wildlife and its
              habitat to its original state and to compensate Inuvialuit
              hunters, trappers and fishermen for the loss of their subsistence
              or commercial harvesting opportunities;
            </li>
            <li>
              An estimate of the potential liability of the Proponents,
              determined on a worst case scenario, taking into consideration the
              balance between economic factors, including the ability of the
              Proponents to pay, and environmental factors, as referred to in
              paragraph&nbsp;13(11)(b) of the IFA.

<p class="text-center "><strong>December&nbsp;16, 2013</strong></p>
<p>The NEB and DFO have entered into a MOU regarding fish and fish habitat. Through this MOU, the NEB will now be responsible for assessing potential impacts to fisheries from proposed NEB regulated pipeline and power line applications.</p>
<p>Applications submitted to the NEB shall be reviewed under the Fisheries Protection Provisions of the Fisheries Act to determine if impacts shall occur, and if an authorization will be required under the <em>Fisheries Act</em>. The NEB shall also become responsible to determine if proposed projects will impact aquatic species at risk and require permitting under the <em>Species at Risk Act</em>. If the NEB determines than an authorization or permit will be required, DFO shall be notified and will be responsible for issuing the authorization or permit.</p>
<p>This MOU better integrates the Government of Canada’s initiative to streamline application processes by eliminating the requirement for duplicate reviews.</p>

<p>BETWEEN:</p>
<p>Fisheries and Oceans Canada (“DFO”)</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>National Energy Board (“NEB”)</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Whereas:</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-lwr-alph ">
<li>the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> assigns to the federal government exclusive jurisdiction for sea coast and inland fisheries, and the <em>Fisheries Act</em> sets out the powers and duties of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans with respect to conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat, specifically the habitat protection and pollution prevention provisions;</li>
<li>Fisheries and Oceans Canada (“DFO”) is responsible for the administration of the <em>Fisheries Act</em>, specifically the fisheries protection provisions including sections&nbsp;6, 20, 21, 35, 37, and&nbsp;38, related to the conservation and protection of Canada's marine and freshwater fisheries resources and their habitats from the impact of human activities;</li>
<li>the <em>Species at Risk Act</em> (“SARA”) identifies the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans as the competent minister with respect to aquatic species other than those individuals in or on federal lands administered by the Parks Canada Agency and, in that capacity, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has powers and duties with respect to protecting aquatic species listed under that Act;</li>
<li>the National Energy Board (“NEB”) is a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal with regulatory responsibilities under the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (“NEBA”) for inter-provincial and international natural gas, oil and commodity pipelines, international power lines and designated inter-provincial power lines (“energy infrastructure”);</li>
<li>DFO and the NEB have respective responsibilities for federal regulatory reviews and approvals and environmental protection related to the construction and operation, decommissioning, and abandonment of energy infrastructure and as such are committed to fostering and developing a collaborative approach to fish and fish habitat protection that is consistent in all parts of Canada;</li>
<li>when the Crown contemplates conduct that may adversely affect established or potential Aboriginal and treaty rights in relation to the issuance of authorizations under the <em>Fisheries Act</em>, and/or permits under SARA, the NEB application assessment process will be relied upon by DFO to the extent possible, to ensure Aboriginal groups are consulted as required, and where appropriate accommodated; and</li>
<li>DFO and the NEB are committed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the assessment of applications for energy infrastructure through coordination of regulatory activities under the NEBA, the <em>Fisheries Act</em>, and SARA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Therefore</strong>, DFO and the NEB (the “Parties”) agree to the following Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”):</p>
<h2>2. Guiding Principles</h2>
<ul class="lst-lwr-alph ">
<li>The Parties will use the provisions of this MOU to support the Government of Canada’s regulatory process improvement objectives through coordination to:
<ul class="lst-lwr-rmn ">
<li>Facilitate effective and efficient use of government resources in order that regulatory decisions are made in a timely manner by applying a one-project one-review approach;</li>
<li>Promote clarity and consistency of the regulatory decision making process; and</li>
<li>Ensure responsibilities for mitigation, monitoring and reporting, compliance and enforcement, follow-up monitoring, and Aboriginal consultation are addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decisions with respect to the issuance of paragraph 35(2)(<em>b</em>) <em>Fisheries Act</em> Authorizations remains DFO’s responsibility until and unless the NEB is prescribed as a person or entity for granting such authorizations, in accordance with paragraph&nbsp;35(2)(<em>c</em>), pursuant to regulations made by the Governor in Council under subparagraph&nbsp;43(1)(<em>i.3</em>).</li>
<li>Conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat, and listed aquatic species at risk and their critical habitat, will be managed in accordance with DFO’s regulatory and policy frameworks for the application of the fisheries protection provisions of the <em>Fisheries Act</em> and SARA respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Purpose</h2>
<ul class="lst-lwr-alph ">
<li>The Parties will work together in the development of work plans and protocols to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory reviews of applications and decision-making related to the roles and responsibilities of each Party for:
<ul class="lst-lwr-rmn ">
<li>Reviewing and assessing of NEBA applications for energy infrastructure for potential impacts to fish and fish habitat including listed aquatic species and their critical habitat under SARA;</li>
<li>Ensuring that the NEB’s assessment of applications considers the intent and requirements of the NEBA, <em>Fisheries Act</em>, and SARA; and</li>
<li>Auditing and reporting on the discussions and actions taken under this MOU.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This MOU will clarify and facilitate the implementation of NEB’s role in the application of DFO’s fisheries protection policies and operational approaches to energy infrastructure.</li>
<li>Work coordinated under this MOU will enable DFO and NEB to propose regulations that would prescribe the NEB as a person or entity who would be authorized to issue <em>Fisheries Act</em> Authorizations.</li>
<li>Subsection&nbsp;36(3) of the <em>Fisheries Act</em> related to deposit of deleterious substances into fish bearing waters is administered by the Minister of the Environment and is outside the scope of this MOU.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Work to be coordinated</h2>
<ul class="lst-lwr-alph ">
<li> The Parties will establish, wherever possible, clear, comprehensive and harmonized policies, standards, guidelines, procedures and/or protocols to guide and measure regulatory performance related to the following activities as they relate to the construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of energy infrastructure for:
<ul class="lst-lwr-rmn ">
    <li>Reviewing energy infrastructure applications for potential impacts to fish and fish habitat;</li>
    <li>Developing and improving technical capacity through training and other knowledge transfer mechanisms for assessing impacts to fish and fish habitat including the development of protocols and engagement with Practitioners from DFO Fisheries Protection and Species at Risk Programs;</li>

<h4>Independent Contractor</h4>
<p>3.1 The NEB is an independent contractor under this Agreement.

<p>4.2 In cases where the NEB determines it does not have sufficient resources to adequately perform requested Services under this Agreement, the NEB will notify the GNWT. The NEB may engage third party contractors to perform the Services and will provide to the GNWT the estimated costs of such Services before entering into any agreements for the provision of such Services. The GNWT will then confirm whether it consents to the NEB incurring the costs of such Services.</p>
<p>4.3 The provision of the Services by the NEB will be subject to instructions provided from time to time by the Regulator, CCO and CSO or their designates.</p>
<p>4.4 The GNWT will pay for Services rendered under this Agreement based on the calculations in Article&nbsp;5 - Cost Recovery, using one of the following cost recovery mechanisms:</p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<ul class="list-unstyled ">
<li>4.4.1 Fee for the Services of NEB Employees - Annual or Hourly Rate</li>
<li>4.4.2 Fee for Third Party (Contracted) Services</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Service Standards</h4>
<p>4.5 In the course of providing the Services under this Agreement, the NEB will ensure that every employee and third party contractor of the NEB carrying out Services under this Agreement will act in an efficient and professional manner.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Applicable Laws</h4>
<p>4.6 Services provided by the NEB pursuant to this Agreement will be provided in accordance with the Mirror Legislation and any other laws of general application.

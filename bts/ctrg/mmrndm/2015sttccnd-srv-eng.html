<p><strong>“Visitor” «&nbsp;Visiteur&nbsp;»</strong></p>
<p>“Visitor” means an individual, other than an Authorized Person, who has been invited into the secure area by an Authorized Person, as permitted by the Receiving Agency’s access policies.</p>
<h3>Security Requirements</h3>
<p>The Information is designated as “protected&nbsp;B” pursuant to the <em>Policy on Government Security</em>. The Receiving Agency’s Official agrees to ensure that adequate protection is in place to provide for the security of the Information. The security requirements described below are the minimum requirements that will be met by the Receiving Agency.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Access</strong></p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<ol class="list-unstyled ">
<li>1. The Information will be accessed within a secure location that allows unescorted access only to Authorized Persons. All Visitors to the secure location will be escorted by an Authorized Person at all times. The secure location can be within a series of buildings, one entire building, an entire floor within a building, or a single room. Once the perimeter of the secure location is defined, these requirements apply to all areas within the perimeter. Where a series of buildings is involved, a secure perimeter will be defined for each building.</li>
<li>2. Access to the Information is limited to Identified Persons. The duties of the Data Custodian, as stated in <a href="#nnxc">Appendix&nbsp;‘C’</a>, include maintaining an auditable trail on access to the Information by Identified Persons.</li>
<li>3. Escorted Visitors may access the secure area. However, under no circumstances may Visitors be permitted to access the Information.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong>IT Storage and Transmission</strong></p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<ol class="list-unstyled ">
<li>4. All Systems with access to the Information will employ Logical Access Controls at the device and network level.</li>
<li>5. Where the Information is held on Transportable Media, complex passwords with encryption will be used. The encryption level must meet the latest Communications Security Establishment standards for “protected&nbsp;B” information. This applies equally to backups of the Information stored on Transportable Media.</li>
<li>6. The Information cannot be electronically transmitted, except as described in points&nbsp;7 and 8. Electronic transmission includes, without being limited to, transmittal of the Information by facsimile or by e-mail.</li>
<li>7. Servers storing and transmitting unencrypted data, where used, will be located in a secure, controlled-access area, preferably in the same area where the Information is accessed. If located in a separate area, controls will be in place to ensure that only Identified Persons can access the server. Unless the Information is encrypted continuously while outside the secure area, a conduit will be used for all cabling and all cross-connect areas will be physically secured.</li>
<li>8. Network firewalls and access rules will be in place to prevent access to the Information, other than to Identified Persons. Information may be stored on and transmitted over networks not meeting these requirements, provided that it is encrypted, except when at rest and in use by an Identified Person. Alternatively, the Information may be stored on a stand-alone computer in a secure area with no external connections, or on a closed network within the secure area. When the network transmits information that leaves a secure area (for example, when a series of buildings house employees within a single organization), the Information will be encrypted whenever it is outside the secure area.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong>Physical Storage</strong></p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<ol class="list-unstyled ">
<li>9. When not in use, Transportable Media containing the Information will be stored in secure containers. This applies equally to backups of the Information.</li>

<li>11. When not in use, printed documents containing the Information will always be stored in secure containers.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong>Information Copying and Retention &amp; Record Management</strong></p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<ol class="list-unstyled ">
<li>12. Copies and extracts of the Information may only be made for the purposes of carrying out work as covered by the MOU. When no longer needed, any such copies or extracts will be destroyed in a secure manner (as per points&nbsp;13 and 14).</li>
<li>13. Paper documents containing the Information will be destroyed (shredded) in a secure manner before disposal. Any destruction will occur within the secure area.</li>
<li>14. All electronic storage media used in the processing of the Information, including all back-up, Transportable Media, photocopiers and other electronic media where the Information has been electronically stored will be sanitized or destroyed, in accordance with the latest Communications Security Establishment standards for “protected&nbsp;B” information when disposing of such media, or when return or destruction of the Information is required pursuant to section&nbsp;10 of this MOU. Any destruction will occur within the secure area.</li>
<li>15. The Receiving Agency’s Data Custodian agrees to establish and maintain an inventory of all data files received from Statistics Canada, as stated in <a href="#nnxc">Appendix&nbsp;‘C’</a>.</li>

<br>
STATISTICAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES</h2>
<p>The Information shared with the Receiving Agency contains Survey Responses from, and Paradata about, identifiable Survey Respondents. This MOU sets out a number of requirements, including that the Information will only be used for statistical and research purposes by the Receiving Agency. <strong>The Receiving Agency will not use the Information for Administrative or Regulatory Purposes.</strong> “Work for statistical and research purposes” is defined below.</p>
<p><strong>What is work for statistical and research purposes?</strong></p>
<p><em>Phase&nbsp;A: Production of statistical outputs</em></p>
<p>This is the technical phase that uses Information, that is, Survey Responses and Paradata, as input and, implementing detailed specifications, produces such statistical outputs as data tabulations or regression coefficients.</p>
<p><em>Phase&nbsp;B: Statistical analysis to determine whether outputs are appropriate for use</em></p>
<p>In this phase, the work is to determine whether, from a statistical point of view, the statistical output is appropriate for its intended uses. This phase involves such activities as examining the influence of outliers and the analysis of residuals.</p>
<p><em>Phase&nbsp;C: Determination of confidentiality of statistical output</em></p>
<p>In this phase, the Receiving Agency has to determine whether the statistical output can, alone or in conjunction with Statistics Canada publications and/or other publicly available sources, identify or disclose information about a Person. At the end of this phase, all statistical outputs will be categorized as being confidential or non-confidential.</p>
<p>The precise methods for and complexity of determining the confidentiality of statistical outputs will vary according to the underlying distribution of Information, and the types of statistical outputs. The Receiving Agency must consult Statistics Canada about the statistical outputs to ensure that no confidential Information will be released or used for Administrative or Regulatory Purposes by the Receiving Agency.</p>
<p><em>Phase&nbsp;D: Use of statistical outputs </em></p>
<p>The Receiving Agency agrees not to release or use for Administrative or Regulatory Purposes any statistical outputs identified as being confidential (these outputs are defined as “Information” throughout this MOU).</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on the use of non-confidential statistical outputs. This includes their use for policy development and evaluation, as well as for monitoring or regulatory purposes but only at an aggregate, non-confidential level. Non-confidential statistical outputs may be published or distributed by the Receiving Agency.</p>
<p><strong>Clarification of Administrative or Regulatory Purposes</strong></p>
<p>Use of Information for Administrative or Regulatory Purposes means the use of confidential statistical outputs in a decision-making process that directly affects the Respondent or any other Person. This applies to all phases of work for statistical purposes.</p>
<p>For example, assume the Receiving Agency wishes to examine the impact of changing program benefits by 10% for a particular category of Person. The first three phases conclude that the required statistical outputs are not confidential. Therefore, Phase&nbsp;D allows the Receiving Agency to identify the number of Persons who would be affected by the change in program benefits. It is not permitted for the Receiving Agency’s policy analysts, program administrators, or any other employee, to identify from the microdata obtained from Statistics Canada, whether a particular Person is included or not in the list of those who would be affected by the change in program benefits.</p>
<p>The Receiving Agency agrees not to contact a Person (including any Respondent) to address any issue identified on the basis of the Information provided under this MOU. This includes contact to benefit a Person, such as alerting a Person to benefits or programs to which he/she could apply, or contact to conduct enforcement against a Person, such as initiating an audit or removing benefits from a Person based on the Information.</p>

<br>
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DATA CUSTODIAN</h2>
<p>The Data Custodian designated by the Receiving Agency pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;6.1.1 of this MOU will:</p>
<ol>
<li>prepare a document for the use of the Receiving Agency’s employees and contractors, outlining the terms and conditions governing the use of the Information, as well as the procedures to send, receive, handle and store the Information (hereinafter the “Confidentiality Document”). The Confidentiality Document will enumerate the following requirements of this MOU:
<ol class="lst-lwr-rmn ">
<li>Confidentiality of the Information, as specified in section&nbsp;4.</li>
<li>Use of the Information, as specified in section&nbsp;5.</li>
<li>Access to the Information, as specified in section&nbsp;6.</li>
<li>Security Requirements, as specified in <a href="#nnxa">Appendix&nbsp;‘A’</a>.</li>
<li>Statistical and Research Purposes, as specified in <a href="#nnxb">Appendix&nbsp;‘B’</a>.<br>
<br>
Prior to granting access, the Data Custodian will ensure that every employee and contractor who accesses the Information has agreed in writing to comply with the terms of this MOU by signing an acknowledgment that they have read, understood and agree to comply with the terms and conditions of this MOU as highlighted in the Confidentiality Document.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>acknowledge receipt of each data file received from Statistics Canada pursuant to this MOU, and maintain a register of all such files containing the following information: 
<ul>
<li>Date received;</li>
<li>File name and reference period (or other information to distinguish different files from the same survey);</li>
<li>Employee who received the file from Statistics Canada;</li>
<li>Employee at Statistics Canada who sent the file;</li>
<li>Employee responsible for safekeeping of the file; and</li>
<li>Date the file was destroyed or returned to Statistics Canada (if applicable).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>maintain a register of all persons who have been granted access to the data files received from Statistics Canada by the Receiving Agency, containing the following information:
<ul>
<li>File name and reference period (or other information to distinguish different files from the same survey);</li>
<li>Name of employee or contractor to whom access is given;</li>
<li>Justification for access;</li>
<li>Name of delegated manager who authorized access and date of authorization; and</li>
<li>Start and end dates of period for which access is authorized.</li>

            This policy memorandum establishes procedures to be followed when an
            occupational health and safety (OHS) complaint from an employee of
            Regional Operations and Compliance is referred to the Minister of
            Labour for investigation under subsection&nbsp;127.1(8) of
            Part&nbsp;II of the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy for handling internal OHS complaints will ensure the
            completion of fair and unbiased investigations and prevent any real
            or perceived conflicts of interest with both the investigation
            process and final outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Notification Procedures</strong><br />
            When a Labour Program employee's OHS complaint remains unresolved
            and is referred to the Minister of Labour for investigation, the
            Manager or Regional Director shall without delay send the complaint
            registration form and all supporting documentation to the Manager of
            Workplace Directorate's OHS Compliance and Operations Unit. The case
            will then be transferred to and investigated by a Delegated Official
            employed by the National Energy Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Complaint Investigation Process</strong><br />
            The assigned investigator shall follow all procedural requirements
            as stipulated within OPD 700-9 entitled &quot;Complaints Handling,
            <em>Canada Labour Code</em> Part&nbsp;II,&quot; as well as all other
            applicable OPDs and IPGs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Labour Program officials under investigation shall fully cooperate
            with the assigned investigator and not hinder the investigation in
            any manner, as required by Sections&nbsp;142, 143, and&nbsp;143.1 of
            the Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Investigator Guidance</strong><br />
            When necessary, the assigned investigator shall consult with their
            own organization's OHS technical advisors/resources. In the event
            that additional technical guidance is required, a request for
            assistance can be sent to the Labour Program's Workplace Directorate
            via normal channels. Workplace Directorate Program Advisors will
            then provide the requested technical assistance, but they will not
            be made privy to the details of the case including the individuals
            involved, in order to protect the integrity of the investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Employer Assistance</strong><br />
            If the Labour Program officials under investigation require guidance
            or assistance, they are to consult directly with the Health, Safety
            and Disability Management Division of ESDC.

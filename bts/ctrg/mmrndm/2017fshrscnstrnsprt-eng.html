            <h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
            <p>
              On November&nbsp;29<sup>th</sup> 2016, the Governor in Council
              directed the National Energy Board (NEB) to issue a Certificate of
              Public Convenience and Necessity for the Trans Mountain Expansion
              Project (TMEP or Project).
            </p>
            <p>
              On December&nbsp;1<sup>st</sup> 2016, the NEB issued
              Certificate&nbsp;OC-064 authorizing the construction and operation
              of the TMEP subject to 157&nbsp;conditions over 8&nbsp;legal
              instruments, as set out in the National Energy Board
              Recommendation Report.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NEB conducted the environmental assessment of the TMEP and
              concluded that, among other things, the operation of
              project-related marine vessels is likely to result in significant
              adverse effects to the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale
              (SRKW) and Indigenous cultural use associated with the SRKW.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two communities of resident killer whales in British
              Columbia, Northern Residents and Southern Residents. The SRKW was
              listed as Endangered under Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act
              upon its coming into force in 2003. Since monitoring of the
              population started in 1974, it has fluctuated from
              70&nbsp;individuals to 99 individuals (1995). Currently, the
              population is less than 80&nbsp;individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC (Trans Mountain) has not proposed any
              direct mitigation for project related impacts on marine mammals,
              as they do not exercise direct control over TMEP related vessels.
              Trans Mountain has committed to a number of initiatives to advance
              recovery of the SRKW.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mitigation to address effects from TMEP-related vessels is outside
              of the NEB’s regulatory authority and accordingly, the NEB
              encouraged other regulatory authorities, such as Transport Canada
              (TC) and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), which regulate the
              marine environment and marine traffic, to explore initiatives that
              would aim to reduce the potential effects of marine vessels on
              marine mammals.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WHEREAS:</strong> DFO is responsible for the
              administration and enforcement of the Fisheries Act, more
              specifically the fisheries protection provisions including
              sections&nbsp;6, 20, 21, 35, 37 and 38, related to the
              conservation and protection of Canada's marine and freshwater
              fisheries resources and their habitats from the impact of human
              activities;
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WHEREAS:</strong> the Species at Risk Act (SARA)
              identifies the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans as the competent
              minister with respect to listed aquatic species other than those
              individuals in or on federal lands administered by the Parks
              Canada Agency and, in that capacity, the Minister of Fisheries and
              Oceans has powers and duties with respect to protecting aquatic
              species listed under that Act; and
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>AND WHEREAS:</strong> TC is responsible for the

            <p>
              <strong>NOW THEREFORE:</strong> The Participants (the NEB, DFO and
              TC) have entered into the following Memorandum of Understanding
              (MOU) to clarify the intended activities among the NEB, TC, and
              DFO to promote the efficient and effective coordination of
              responsibilities with respect to verifying compliance with
              conditions associated with the construction and operation of the
              TMEP.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Participants will rely on this MOU to support the Government
              of Canada’s commitment to more than mitigate the effects of
              Project-related marine shipping on SRKW before shipping from the
              Project begins (anticipated in December 2019).
            </p>
            <h2>1. PURPOSE</h2>
            <p>
              Certain conditions for the TMEP are of relevance to TC as the
              federal department responsible for oversight of marine shipping
              and navigation and promoting marine safety and to DFO as the
              federal department responsible for managing and protecting
              Canada’s fisheries and safeguarding its waters.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.1 The purpose of this MOU is to clarify how the Participants
              will cooperate to verify compliance to those conditions, as set
              out in <a href="#nnxi">Annex&nbsp;I</a> to this MOU, as well as
              Trans Mountain’s commitments, as set out in
              <a href="#nnxii">Annex&nbsp;II</a> to this MOU, that apply to the
              SRKW. Specifically, this MOU sets out the areas in relation to
              which the Participants will share information and expertise, and
              enables the facilitation of linkages, where possible, between
              Trans Mountain’s activities and TC and DFO-led actions to support
              recovery of the SRKW population.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.2 The NEB will advise DFO and TC by e-mail when Trans Mountain
              has filed information pursuant to the Conditions set out in
              paragraph&nbsp;2.1 of this MOU and invite DFO and TC to comment on
              the filings.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.3 In respect of Trans Mountain’s condition compliance filings as
              referred to in paragraph&nbsp;1.2 above, DFO and TC will support
              the NEB’s assessment of the filings by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sharing information and expertise under each of their respective
                mandates to verify that Trans Mountain will meet all conditions
                and commitments described in Annex I and II, to minimize impacts
                on the SRKW population;
              </li>
              <li>
                Sharing information and expertise on (but not limited to):
                documentation relating to these conditions and commitments,
                underwater noise, marine safety and security, species at risk,
                new or emerging technologies or practices in the international
                or domestic marine environment, and the recovery of the SRKW,
                including scientific expertise and socio-economic considerations
                with respect to mitigation measures; and,
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensuring alignment, where applicable, between Trans Mountain’s
                commitments and Government of Canada initiatives to assist in
                the recovery of the SRKW and the associated commitment to more
                than mitigate the effects of project-related marine shipping on
                SRKW.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              1.4. The NEB will consider expertise and advice provided by TC and
              DFO in making its determination on whether a condition has been
              met. This includes the determination of compliance with
              commitments included in <a href="#nnxii">Annex&nbsp;II</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.5 The Participants agree to submit all their respective filings
              and comments in writing on the NEB’s electronic Regulatory
              Document System.

                  and/or which are being considered likely to be referred for a

                  regulatory permitting processes, and final approval decisions

                  have secure access to the repository in order to provide their
                  consultation records. The repository will allow for the

                  consultation activities with Aboriginal groups for Projects.
                  The repository will also serve as a cross reference to other

            <strong>A.1.1 Major Projects Deputy Ministers’ Committee</strong>
            will serve as the governance body for the implementation of this
            MOU. Each member of the Deputy Ministers’ Committee will ensure that
            their respective department/agency will adhere to the principles,
            objectives and governance structure defined in this MOU. The key
            role of the Deputy Ministers’ Committee is to provide overall advice
            or direction for the resolution of Project-specific policy issues or
            issues related to federal participation in environmental
            assessment/environmental impact review and regulatory permitting
            processes of Projects. Members of the Deputy Ministers’ Committee
            whose departments have specific environmental
            assessment/environmental impact review, regulatory permitting and
            decision-making responsibilities in relation to a Project will be
            the signatories on Northern Project Agreements, defined in
            Section&nbsp;4.1 of this MOU, and amendments to those agreements as
            required.
          </p>
          <p>
            A status report may be provided by the NPMO outlining issues and
            federal activities as they relate to the environmental
            assessment/environmental impact review and regulatory permitting of
            Projects at monthly meetings of the Deputy Ministers’ Committee.

            supports the governance and decision-making functions of the Major
            Projects Deputy Ministers’ Committee. The Working Group will meet on
            a monthly basis prior to the Major Projects Deputy Ministers
            Committee meeting. The Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for
            NPMO will be a member of this Working Group for purposes of
            exchanging information on specific northern project issues, as well
            as using this Working Group to address horizontal pan-Northern
            issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A.1.3 MPMO Directors General Working Group</strong> provides
            an interdepartmental coordination network, meeting on a monthly
            basis to support the Major Projects Deputy Ministers’ Committee and
            the MPMO Assistant Deputy Ministers’ Working Group. Directors
            General from the Parties compose the membership. The Directors
            General Working Group may provide advice and recommendations
            concerning northern projects and issues management to support the
            MPMO governance hierarchy. The Directors General Working Group will
            be the primary interface between the MPMO governance hierarchy and
            the Territorial Project Committees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MPMO Directors General Working Group will also function as the
            Crown Consultation Advisory Committee and will provide overall
            guidance for ensuring that the Crown’s legal duty to consult
            aboriginal groups is effectively and efficiently fulfilled. The
            Crown Consultation Advisory Committee, having assistance and advice
            from the Parties and the Department of Justice, will monitor
            existing board processes to determine on a project-by-project basis,
            to what extent the Crown can rely on the board processes to assist
            the Crown in fulfilling its duty to consult, and where appropriate,
            accommodate. This Committee will also assess the extent to which
            proponent engagement with potentially affected Aboriginal groups can
            be relied on to assist the Crown in fulfilling its duty to consult.
            This Committee may identify as required, possible risks, issues or
            consultation gaps that may require Crown consultation outside of the
            board processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A.1.4 Territorial Project Committees</strong> exist in each
            of the three Territories. The Territorial Project Committees consist
            of Director-level or delegated representatives of the Parties having
            regulatory and review responsibilities for Projects in the
            territories. Director-level representatives from relevant
            territorial government departments are invited to join the
            Territorial Project Committees if they wish.  Environmental
            assessment/environmental impact review and regulatory permitting
            boards will be invited to participate in the general discussions of
            the Territorial Project Committees, but will not participate in
            project-specific discussions. The Territorial Project Committees
            will assist in the implementation of this MOU and provide a forum
            for information exchange, planning and coordination of federal
            responsibilities, issue identification, management and resolution
            for a particular Project. The Territorial Project Committees will be
            responsible for providing advice and support to the MPMO Directors
            General Working Group concerning Projects.. The NPMO will serve as
            the secretariat to the Territorial Project Committees.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A.1.5 Resource Development Advisory Group (RDAG)</strong>
            may be created by NPMO for projects in the early- to
            advanced-exploration stage at the request of a project proponent. An
            RDAG will normally consist of the project proponent, representatives
            appointed by the Parties, Territorial government departments, the
            environmental assessment/environmental impact review board staff
            where appropriate, and representatives of relevant Aboriginal
            governments. The NPMO will serve as the secretariat to the RDAG.
          </p>
          <p>
            An RDAG meeting will offer the proponent an opportunity to describe
            their proposed or draft project plans, plans for collecting baseline
            environmental, cultural and socio-economic data, and to learn from
            regulators what information can be reasonably expected from a
            proponent under federal and territorial regulatory and environmental
            assessment and regulatory processes. The RDAG may also provide the
            proponent with information from the Parties on available baseline
            data, technical information or knowledge that is relevant to the
            proponent's planned project. The RDAG may also inform the proponent
            on opportunities and requirements for engagement with Aboriginal
            people, community engagement, and community economic development
            opportunities planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A.1.5 Project-Specific Technical Working Groups</strong>
            will be established by the NPMO for Projects defined in
            Section&nbsp;2.2. The Project-Specific Technical Working Groups will
            bring together technical staff of the Parties and, when appropriate,
            relevant Territorial staff, technical staff or technical consultants
            of Aboriginal groups, proponents, and regulatory board staff for the
            purpose of identifying and resolving Project-specific issues and to
            ensure consistent and timely technical advice to the Review and
            regulatory Boards. During the environmental assessment/environmental
            impact review process, the Project-Specific technical working group
            will meet on as-needed basis to discuss technical issues related to
            the Project that could cause delays in the Project review. The
            Project-Specific Technical Working Group may meet to review Pro ject
            descriptions/impact statements, discuss the NPA for the Project,
            discuss coordination of information requests, participation and
            responses at technical hearings and public meetings, coordination of
            Crown consultation, and any other project-related issue which may
            require resolution or a coordinated response by the Parties. The
            NPMO will serve as the secretariat to the Project-Specific Technical
            Working Group.

<p><strong>Whereas</strong>, pursuant to the <em>Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act</em> (<em>CTAISB Act</em>), the TSB has the responsibility to advance transportation safety; its responsibility being carried out by conducting independent investigations, and if necessary, public inquiries into transportation occurrences to make findings as to their causes and contributing factors and by making recommendations to eliminate or reduce safety deficiencies as evidenced by those investigations;</p>
        <p><strong>Whereas</strong>, pursuant to subsection&nbsp;14(3) of the <em>CTAISB Act</em>, the NEB is precluded from investigating a transportation occurrence for the purpose of making findings as to its causes and contributing factors if the occurrence is or has been investigated by the TSB or if the TSB has informed the NEB that it intends to do so;</p>
        <p><strong>Whereas</strong>, pursuant to the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (<em>NEB Act</em>), the NEB has the primary responsibility to regulate, inter alia, the safe design, construction, operation and abandonment of oil and gas pipelines; the responsibility to investigate accidents involving those pipelines; the authority to hold a public inquiry into, and make findings as to, the cause of the accident or factors contributing to it; and the power to make recommendations relating to the prevention of similar accidents, and the responsibility to issue orders related to the design, operation and abandonment of pipelines;</p>
        <p><strong>Whereas</strong>, pursuant to paragraph 14(4)(<em>a</em>) and subsection&nbsp;14(5) of the <em>CTAISB Act,</em> while the TSB is investigating a transportation occurrence, the NEB is able to continue at its discretion with its own activities (for example, taking emergency remedial measures, conducting investigations for regulatory purposes other than making findings as to causes or contributing factors);</p>
        <p><strong>Whereas</strong>, pursuant to subsection&nbsp;15(2) of the <em>CTAISB Act</em>, where conflicting interests arise between the TSB and the NEB in coordinating their activities during the investigation of an occurrence, the requirements and interests of the TSB shall take precedence and be paramount to the extent of the conflict.</p>
        <p><strong>Whereas</strong>, reportable occurrences are required to be reported to the TSB, pursuant to the <em>Transportation Safety Board Regulations</em> (<em>TSBR</em>);</p>
        <p><strong>Whereas</strong>, incidents relating to the construction, operation or abandonment of a pipeline are required to be reported to the NEB pursuant to section&nbsp;52 of the <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations,1999</em> (<em>OPR</em>); and section&nbsp;46 of the <em>Processing Plant Regulations</em> (<em>PPR</em>).</p>
        <p><strong>Whereas</strong>, <em>it is desirable that the TSB and the NEB (the Parties) coordinate their activities without compromising their respective independence and with minimal adverse effect on each other's operations;</em></p>
        <p><strong>Therefore</strong>, it is desirable for the Parties to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding providing for the coordination of activities with respect to occurrences, including investigation procedures and practices and requirements for reporting occurrences, and providing for conflict resolution procedures.</p>

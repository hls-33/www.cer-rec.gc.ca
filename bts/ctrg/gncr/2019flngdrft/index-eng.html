                In accordance with the transition provisions in Bill&nbsp;C-69,
                any application that is undergoing an assessment immediately
                prior to the Canadian Energy Regulator Act coming into force
                will continue to be assessed under the National Energy Board Act

                An application that is received <strong>after</strong> the
                coming into force of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act will be
                assessed as appropriate using the guidance found in the Filing
                Manual and the Interim Guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Companies should also refer to the applicable legislation, Board
                decisions, regulations, and guidelines for more detailed
                direction, and to gain an understanding of their full
                obligations when applying for a project.

              <p>
                The Interim Guidance may be adjusted as any additional guidance
                is issued, or as feedback is received.

              <p><strong>Legislative changes requiring new guidance</strong></p>
              <p>
                Attached in Annex B to this letter is draft interim guidance for
                new factors identified in the Canadian Energy Regulator Act:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>Potential impacts on the rights of Indigenous peoples</li>
                <li>Canada’s commitments in respect of climate change</li>
                <li>Canada’s environmental obligations</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, the Canadian Energy Regulator Act provides minor
                updates with respect to companies’ requirements for
                right-of-entry. Annex B provides a minor update to the Filing
                Manual Guide V to reflect this change.

              <p><strong>Draft Early Engagement Guide</strong></p>
              <p>
                Early engagement can help to identify and address issues, foster
                early discussions between the proponent, Indigenous groups and
                stakeholders, and assist in making the review process more
                focused and efficient. The NEB has outlined its expectations
                regarding the early engagement that occurs prior to the filing
                of an application. This is provided in a stand-alone CER Early
                Engagement Guide, attached in Annex&nbsp;C. This guide is
                similar to what is currently found in the Filing Manual, with
                the addition of greater detail on the steps and timing of the
                early engagement phase.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new proposed early engagement phase resulted in minor
                changes to the Filing Manual<br />
                Section&nbsp;3.4, which are also reflected in Annex&nbsp;C.

              <p><strong>Future Updates</strong></p>
              <p>
                The NEB will continue to update its website to provide
                information about the implementation of Bill&nbsp;C-69, in
                particular with respect to the Canadian Energy Regulator Act.

                In the months following coming into force and the issuance of
                the <strong>Interim Filing Guidance</strong>, the CER will
                review and continue to improve upon its Filing Manual, starting
                with a more extensive consultative process on the content. It is
                anticipated that additional guidance documents will be released
                through that process.

                In 2016, the Minister of Natural Resources convened an expert
                Panel to conduct a targeted review of the NEB’s structure, role
                and mandate under the National Energy Board Act. Similarly, the
                Minister of Environment and Climate Change established a Panel
                to review the environmental assessment process in Canada under
                the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. These were key
                elements of the Government of Canada's review of environmental
                and regulatory processes.<sup id="fn6-rf"

              <p>
                Both Panels engaged broadly through various means with
                Indigenous peoples, interested stakeholders including industry,
                provinces and territories as well as the public. The Panel
                reviewing the NEB released its Report<sup id="fn7-rf"

              <p>
                Bill&nbsp;C-69 would also replace the Canadian Environmental
                Assessment Agency with a new Impact Assessment Agency of Canada
                (Agency), which will lead project reviews for designated
                projects as defined under the Impact Assessment Act (including
                the Regulations Designating Physical Activities or as designated
                by the Minister under that Act). The assessment of designated
                projects subject to regulation under the Canadian Energy
                Regulator Act will be conducted by an integrated review by the
                CER and the Agency.

                Assessments of non-designated projects conducted by the

                integrated review panels (under the Impact Assessment Act and
                Canadian Energy Regulator Act) will be subject to legislated
                time limits. Time limits are set out in the Canadian Energy
                Regulator Act (for non-designated projects) and the Impact
                Assessment Act (for designated projects).

                On 21&nbsp;June 2019, Bill&nbsp;C-69 received Royal Assent. The

                The Canadian Energy Regulator Act would require, for
                applications for certain projects, that the Commission take into
                account a number of specified factors to consider including:

              <p>
                In order to understand the extent to which the effects of a
                project would hinder or contribute to the Government of Canada’s
                ability to meet its commitments in respect of climate change, it
                is necessary to assess GHG emissions. The following is proposed
                to replace what is currently in Table&nbsp;A-2 in the Filing
                Manual on GHG emissions.

                Meeting climate change commitments could influence the market,
                supply, and economic conditions in which the project will
                operate. In order to understand the extent to which the effects
                of a project would hinder or contribute to the Government of
                Canada’s ability to meet its commitments in respect of climate
                change, it is also necessary to assess how climate change laws,
                regulations and policies may affect markets and influence the
                need for the project and its economic feasibility. The following
                is therefore proposed in addition to the filing guidance in

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>
                Gender-based analysis plus (GBA+) is a means of identifying and
                analyzing how sex, gender and other identity factors might
                result in different groups of people being affected by a
                pipeline or power line project in different ways. Individual and
                social identity factors can include sex, gender, religion, race,
                social position, income, age, ability, and education. By working
                through a GBA+ analysis, the CER can better understand the
                possible disproportionate effects of a project on distinct
                groups of people, including on vulnerable populations and
                populations identified by gender.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender-based analysis is not new to impact assessment at the
                NEB; however, the CER is making the following changes to guide
                companies in identifying and predicting a project's
                socio-cultural effects on communities. This includes guidance on
                how to address GBA+ in the CER Early Engagement Guide, and also
                draft Interim Filing Guidance.
              </p>
              <h4>CER Early Engagement Guide</h4>
              <p>
                The CER Early Engagement Guide (published under separate cover)
                includes the following guidance for companies:

                  “When designing project-specific engagement activities,
                  companies should consider that the regulator expects
                  engagement activities will be conducted in a manner that
                  facilitates the involvement of all relevant diverse groups of
                  people, including groups identified by gender, as identified
                  through application of gender-based analysis plus (GBA+), as
                  generally described in the CER Draft Interim Filing Guidance
                  for GBA+.”

              <p>
                The nature of the project, together with the environmental and
                socio-economic setting, establish the extent of interactions
                between the project and the environment. Those interactions form
                the basis on which effects are predicted, and for understanding
                the appropriate level of detail needed about the setting,
                interactions, and predicted effects. The extent of public
                interest may also guide the applicant in determining the level
                of detail necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where the project may impact Aboriginal communities and affect
                the use of traditional territory or potential or established
                treaty or Aboriginal rights, applicants must identify the
                potentially-affected Aboriginal groups and carry out effective
                consultations with them to determine their views and concerns.
                If there are potential impacts, applicants must file information
                about the Aboriginal groups affected, the concerns they have
                raised, how the applicant will address the concerns and identify
                any outstanding concerns. The level of detail provided should
                reflect the nature and extent of the impacts, the nature of the
                rights or interests affected and the degree of concern expressed
                by Aboriginal groups.

                  As an example, a project crossing a small and ephemeral
                  watercourse, during the dry period, with no activities or
                  physical works within a fisheries-sensitive zone would likely
                  require less detail on effects on fish and fish habitat than a
                  project requiring in-stream construction work in a
                  fish-bearing watercourse during spawning periods.

              <h4>Guidance &ndash; Identification and Analysis of Effects</h4>
              <p>
                The identification and analysis of project effects builds
                directly on scoping, the description of the environmental and
                socio-economic setting, and the level of detail considerations
                described above.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typically, applicants use a valued component approach to focus
                the effects analysis on practical and representative components
                of the biophysical and socio-economic environment. Valued
                components could be the broad elements described in
                Tables&nbsp;A-1, A-2 and A-3 or a representative subset of those
                elements. In that way, the analysis of potential effects focuses
                on the components of those biophysical or socio-economic
                elements where project-environment interactions are more readily
                assessable, and on the interactions that may be of concern to
                the public or Aboriginal groups (often termed Valued
                Environmental Components [VECs] or Valued Socio-Economic
                Components [VSCs]). The valued components selected must:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  be indicative of predicted effects that could result from the
                  project over time;
                </li>
                <li>
                  have baseline data available in order to determine the
                  significance of effects;
                  <span class="text-danger"><del>and</del></span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  be able to reflect measurable changes that result from the
                  project effects over time;
                </li>
                <li class="text-danger">
                  be sufficient to identify different effects on diverse groups
                  of people, including groups identified by sex and gender, as
                  identified through gender-based analysis plus (GBA+); and
                </li>
                <li class="text-danger">
                  be sufficient to identify potential effects on the exercise of
                  Indigenous rights, including effects on the resources involved
                  in or required for the exercise of those rights, specific
                  locations of cultural importance where those rights are
                  exercised, and an Indigenous group’s cultural traditions, laws
                  and governance systems and how those systems inform the manner
                  in which they exercise their rights.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The analysis should result in an understanding of where
                uncertainty about project-environment interactions may exist, or
                where information gaps necessary to predict effects may remain.
              </p>
              <h4>Spatial and Temporal Boundaries</h4>
              <p>The spatial and temporal boundaries must:</p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  be provided for each valued component, along with a rationale
                  for selecting those boundaries;
                </li>
                <li>
                  include the area over which effects on the valued components
                  may occur. This area could include a population boundary, home
                  range, airshed, watershed, Aboriginal traditional land and
                  resource use areas, or municipal or regional planning
                  districts;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  include the duration that each valued component may be
                  affected;
                </li>
                <li>
                  consider the effects of the project on the valued component
                  and the extent to which those effects are measurable;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>include all phases of the project; and</li>
                <li>not be constrained by jurisdictional boundaries.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Analysis</h4>
              <p>
                The analysis methods must be fully disclosed and meet the study
                needs. In addition to meeting the requirements of other
                regulations (e.g., Species at Risk Act [SARA], Migratory Bird
                Convention Act [MBCA], Fisheries Act, etc.), the analysis of
                project effects must take into account local, regional and
                federal policy or management objectives (e.g., recovery
                strategies, action plans, management plans and land use plans)
                and thresholds. Where there are no management objectives or
                thresholds, include information on the current state of
                knowledge on the valued component. After a review of the
                available literature, if the state of knowledge is incomplete or
                there is substantial uncertainty, identify any information gaps,
                and indicate if and how they will be filled. Where uncertainty
                exists about the project effects on a valued component, describe
                how the inspection and monitoring program will reduce the
                uncertainty.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where there is applicable local and traditional knowledge, it
                must be included in the ESA. See

                    Both the adverse effects of the project, as well as project
                    benefits, can impact people in different ways depending on a
                    variety of identity factors, such as sex, gender, age,
                    culture, Indigeneity, and ability. Gender-based analysis
                    plus (GBA+) can help to consider such differences. In the
                    context of assessing the effects of a proposed project, this
                    includes asking questions such as:

                  <ul class="lst-spcd">
                    <li>
                      What are the relevant identity factors that might
                      determine the extent to which someone is positively or
                      negatively affected by the project?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      How are adverse effects and benefits of a project expected
                      to vary according to these relevant identity factors?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Are tailored mitigation measures available to address the
                      expected differences in the impact of adverse effects and
                      distribution of benefits?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Are such measures practical for the project, and can
                      effectiveness be monitored over time?

                    GBA+ should be applied when considering each of the
                    socio-economic elements in the following tables. Note that
                    differing identity factors might be relevant within
                    different elements &ndash; for example, the group of people
                    that may be differentially affected by project impacts on
                    resource use might differ from the group of people that may
                    be differentially affected by project impacts on human
                    health or project-related employment.

                      Applicants should engage with potentially impacted
                      Indigenous communities to seek to understand the
                      Indigenous rights as they are asserted by rights-bearing
                      communities. Applicants should review the CER Early
                      Engagement Guide, and should engage with potentially
                      impacted Indigenous communities as soon as is practicable
                      in the project’s development in order to allow adequate
                      time to discuss and understand each community’s
                      understandings, practices and assertions related to their
                      rights.

                      describing the Indigenous rights in the project area.
                      Applicants may also wish to consult other relevant
                      government departments or Indigenous organizations that
                      may have information or expertise.

                      relevant for an assessment of the project’s potential
                      effects on the exercise of Indigenous rights. Applicants

                      improve or provide benefit to the exercise of Indigenous
                      rights. Where such measures are proposed, applicants
                      should also describe how these measures have been
                      discussed with potentially impacted Indigenous
                      communities, including any comments or recommendations
                      made by Indigenous communities, or any agreements entered

              <p>
                Where a company does not acquire land required for an approved
                pipeline through negotiations with the landowner, it may apply
                to the Regulator for a right-of-entry order pursuant to
                section&nbsp;324 of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act and the
                National Energy Board Rules of Practice and Procedure, 1995
                (Rules).
              </p>
              <p>
                Guide &nbsp; of the Filing Manual provides guidance regarding
                the information that the company must give to the landowner,
                under section&nbsp;324 of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act,
                prior to applying for a right-of-entry order.

                Guide&nbsp;V further outlines the information required in an
                application to the CER for a right-of-entry order, as
                established in section&nbsp;55 of the Rules. As set out in the
                guidance below, the Rules state that the filing to the CER must
                indicate, among other things, that the notification to the
                landowner contained all the information as required under
                section 324 of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act.

              </h4>
              <p>
                The CER expects an applicant to have a company-wide Engagement
                Program that establishes a systematic, comprehensive and
                proactive approach for the development and implementation of
                project-specific engagement activities. The following
                information is required within the application:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>an overview of the company-wide Engagement Program;</li>
                <li>
                  an overview of the project-specific engagement activities; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  a description of the outcomes of the project-specific
                  engagement activities; or

                  the circumstances and justification for not undertaking
                  project-specific engagement activities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each of these information requirements is discussed in further
                detail in the following sections.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CER also expects companies to continue effective engagement
                activities with the public and Indigenous communities during the
                construction and operation phases of a project. The CER’s
                requirements for engagement related to operations and
                maintenance activities on pipelines can be found on the CER’s
                website in the “Operations and Maintenance Activities on
                Pipelines Regulated Under the National Energy Board Act:
                Requirements and Guidance Notes: (January 2013)”.

              <h5>Goal</h5>
              <p>
                The application outlines the corporate policy or vision with
                respect to engagement and the principles and goals that guide
                the applicant's Engagement Program.
              </p>
              <h5>Filing Requirement</h5>
              <p>
                Provide an overview of the company's engagement approach, which
                should include:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>

                <li>
                  the principles and goals established for the applicant’s
                  Engagement Program; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  a copy of the Indigenous engagement policy, along with any
                  more specific related documented policies and principles, such
                  as, for collecting traditional knowledge or traditional use
                  information.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Guidance</h5>
              <p>
                The CER expects an applicant to have an Engagement Program to
                anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions which have
                the potential to affect persons and communities. An Engagement
                Program should be appropriately integrated into a company’s
                overall management system to provide protection for the public,
                employees, property and the environment throughout the lifecycle
                (design, construction, operation, maintenance, abandonment) of a
                pipeline system. An Engagement Program should be based on the
                elements of a standard management system (for example, the
                management system elements described in the CER’s Onshore
                Pipeline Regulations). Additional guidance is provided in the
                NEB’s Draft Expectations &ndash; Public Involvement
                Program&nbsp;[Filing&nbsp;A22289]<sup id="fn16-rf"

                .
              </p>
              <p>
                The CER also expects applicants to consider the distinct
                language needs of the potentially affected persons and/or
                communities and include a description of this consideration in
                their application. Further to section&nbsp;41 of the Official
                Languages Act, the CER is also committed to fostering the full
                recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian
                society. The CER recognizes the importance of considering
                official languages when developing and implementing an
                engagement program, to result in effective communication with
                potentially affected persons in the official language of their
                choice.
              </p>
              <h4>3.4.2 Design of Project-Specific Engagement Activities</h4>
              <h5>Goal</h5>
              <p>
                The application indicates why the design of project-specific
                engagement activities is appropriate for the nature of the
                project in alignment with the company’s Engagement Program.
              </p>

                <li>
                  a list of potentially affected persons or communities that
                  were engaged for the project, including:
                  <ul class="lst-spcd">
                    <li>
                      landowners, local residents, and land or waterway users;

                <li>
                  a sample of the information package that the applicant has
                  provided to all potentially affected persons and communities
                  as outlined in the CER Early Engagement Guide;
                </li>
                <li>
                  methods, locations, and timing of engagement activities,
                  including where community cultural protocols were identified
                  and followed;
                </li>
                <li>
                  manner in which relevant languages were considered, including
                  in particular how project information will be provided and
                  communicated to potentially affected persons or communities in
                  the official language of their choice to ensure effective and
                  meaningful participation in the CER process;
                </li>
                <li>procedure for responding to issues and concerns; and</li>
                <li>
                  plans for future engagement and follow-up throughout the
                  operations phase of a project, which may include activities
                  such as public awareness programs, continuing education and
                  engagement with persons regarding proposed operations that may
                  potentially affect them.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Guidance</h5>
              <p>
                The CER expects that applicants will consider engagement for all
                projects. Depending on the project scope, that could mean
                carrying out extensive engagement activities or a simple
                engagement activity such as notifying a single landowner.
                Applicants must justify the extent of engagement carried out for
                each application. For additional details, applicants should
                refer to “CER Expectations for Companies during the Early
                Engagement Phase”.
              </p>
              <h5>Local and Traditional Knowledge</h5>
              <p>
                The application should, where relevant, include local and
                traditional knowledge. This information and knowledge should be
                integrated, where appropriate, into the design of the project.
                Where local and traditional knowledge is obtained, provide an
                opportunity for the individual who provided the information to
                confirm the interpretation of the information and how it was
                used in the project design.
              </p>

              <p>
                For engagement activities that could involve a large number of
                people, it might not be practical to list all individuals that
                were engaged. It may be more practical to describe the main
                groups and why they are identified. For example, where a group
                has a common concern or association, describe:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>the group;</li>

                can demonstrate that one or more of the following scenarios
                applies
              </p>
              <h5>Equivalent Engagement Activities</h5>
              <p>
                Engagement has already been undertaken as required by another
                agency and the applicant can demonstrate it is relevant to the
                current project and is equivalent to the CER’s guidance and
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, where a road widening requires that an existing
                CER-regulated pipeline be relocated, the responsible
                transportation authorities might conduct engagement activities
                for the road widening that includes engagement regarding the
                relocation of the pipeline. The pipeline application would then
                include a description of these engagement activities and how it
                meets the requirements of this manual.
              </p>
              <h5>No or Negligible Environmental or Socio-economic Effects</h5>
              <p>
                Applicants will be conducting environmental and socio-economic
                assessments of the project in accordance with the requirements
                of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act and this manual (see
                Guide&nbsp;A within Chapter&nbsp;4).
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this assessment process, applicants will determine the
                potential adverse effects of the project. If the project's
                potential environmental and socio-economic effects are
                negligible, engagement activities might be unnecessary. A
                project with negligible effects might exist where many or all of
                the following conditions are met:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  the proposed project is of a small scale and is localized;
                </li>
                <li>
                  all construction is to occur on previously disturbed land;
                </li>
                <li>there is no potential for an impact on navigation;</li>
                <li>
                  the land acquisition process is complete and landowner
                  concerns have been addressed, or the project work is confined
                  to company owned or leased land;
                </li>
                <li>there are no residents near the proposed project;</li>
                <li>
                  no other land uses or waterway uses or interests would be
                  affected;
                </li>
                <li>
                  there is no potential for traditional use activities to be
                  affected by the project;
                </li>
                <li>
                  there is no potential for cumulative environmental effects;
                </li>
                <li>
                  there would be negligible environmental effects associated
                  with construction and operation of the project;
                </li>
                <li>
                  there is no increase in the storage or disposal of toxic
                  substances;
                </li>
                <li>there is no increase in noise emissions;</li>
                <li>
                  there is no increased emissions in air contaminants; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  there is no potential for local nuisance, including potential
                  for increased dust or traffic.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Because the identification of potential impacts may depend on
                engagement with those people potentially affected and because an
                impact assessment may not yet be completed, applicants should
                generally be conservative when contemplating the possibility
                that engagement may not be necessary. When and where recent
                previous project assessments or engagements are relied on,
                relevant details of these should be cited in the submission to
                the CER.
              </p>
              <h5>Facilities within Company Owned or Leased Lands</h5>
              <p>
                If the application is for a facility within company owned or
                leased land, engagement activities might be unnecessary. This
                may be the case where the application is a facilities
                application that relates to work contained within the confines
                of land the applicant owns or leases (as distinct from land upon
                which the applicant holds an easement only), except where those
                facilities or activities:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  relate to an increase in the storage or disposal of toxic
                  substances;
                </li>
                <li>
                  could result in impacts to traditional land and resource use;
                </li>
                <li>could result in increased noise emissions;</li>
                <li>
                  could result in increased emissions of air contaminants; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  could result in local nuisance, including the potential for
                  increased dust or traffic.

                Engagement Guide<br />
                CER Expectations for Companies during the Early Engagement Phase
              </h2>
              <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                As noted in the preamble to the Canadian Energy Regulator Act,
                the Government of Canada is committed to using transparent
                processes that are built on early engagement and inclusive
                participation and under which the best available scientific
                information and data as well as Indigenous knowledge are taken
                into account in decision-making.
              </p>
              <p>
                The purpose of the CER Early Engagement Guide is to provide
                companies with the CER’s expectations, including filing
                requirements and guidance, during the early engagement phase for
                non-designated projects. Non-designated projects are those
                projects under the jurisdiction of the CER that do not trigger a
                review under the Impact Assessment Act. At the time a company
                files an application it will be required to follow the CER’s
                expectations as described in the relevant Filing Manual
                (specifically, the Filing Manual and the Electricity Filing
                Manual). The Filing Manuals require companies to explain and
                demonstrate the extent to which they followed the expectations
                laid out in the Early Engagement Guide.
              </p>
              <p>
                The early engagement phase covers the pre-application phase: the
                period of time from when a company initiates conceptual plans to
                develop a project until the company submits an application for a
                non-designated project to the CER. In particular, this guidance
                document covers proposed projects that involve constructing or
                modifying facilities that require an application under the
                following sections of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act:
                section&nbsp;182 (applications for pipeline certificates),
                section&nbsp;214 (applications for pipeline orders),
                section&nbsp;248 (applications for power line permits),
                section&nbsp;262 (applications for power line certificates) and
                section&nbsp;298 (applications for offshore renewable energy
                projects and offshore power lines). [Note: for projects that
                also trigger a federal review under the Impact Assessment Act,
                further guidance may be available on the website of the
                Agency<sup id="fn17-rf"
                  ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17"
                    ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>17</a
                  ></sup
                >.]
              </p>
              <p>
                The CER is committed to making decisions or recommendations on
                applications using processes that are fair, transparent, timely
                and accessible. In order to do this, the CER sets out the
                following expectations for companies during the early engagement
                phase.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, the CER expects a company to undertake its engagement
                activities in a manner consistent with the principles of
                meaningful engagement, including:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  be initiated as soon as possible in the planning and design
                  phase of a project;
                </li>
                <li>
                  provide clear, relevant and timely information to potentially
                  affected persons and communities;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  be accessible to and inclusive of all potentially affected
                  persons and communities;
                </li>
                <li>
                  be shaped by input from potentially affected persons and
                  communities (e.g., appropriate methods, timing, language,
                  cultural aspects, and format);
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  provide appropriate and effective opportunities for all
                  potentially affected persons and communities to learn about a
                  project, and to provide comments and concerns about a project
                  to the company;
                </li>
                <li>
                  be responsive to the needs, inputs and concerns of potentially
                  affected persons and communities, and demonstrate how this
                  input informed the proposed design, construction and operation
                  of the Project; and
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  continue throughout the regulatory process, as well as the
                  construction and operation phases of a project.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Second, the CER expects a company to have an Engagement Program
                to anticipate, prevent, mitigate and manage conditions which
                have the potential to affect persons and communities. An
                Engagement Program should be based on the elements of a standard
                management system (for example, the management system elements
                described in the Onshore Pipeline Regulations (OPR). Additional
                guidance is provided in the Draft Expectations for Public
                Involvement Programs [Filing&nbsp;A22289<sup id="fn18-rf"
                  ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn18"
                    ><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>18</a
                  ></sup
                >].
              </p>
              <p>
                Providing potentially affected persons and communities with
                meaningful opportunities to engage early facilitates mutual
                understanding, improves regulatory processes and decisions, and
                promotes outcomes reflective of the public interest. The early
                engagement phase is important because it establishes the
                foundation for a company to develop positive relationships with
                people that are potentially affected by the project, including
                landowners, Indigenous communities, municipalities and others.
              </p>
              <h3>2. Overview of the Early Engagement Phase</h3>
              <p>
                The engagement activities during the early engagement phase are
                largely performed by companies. Conducting these engagement
                activities in a manner consistent with the principles of
                meaningful engagement will facilitate the effective exchange of
                information. This will create opportunities for the company to
                learn about the concerns of potentially affected persons and
                communities, discuss how those concerns can be addressed through
                project design, construction and operations, and develop
                measures to reduce and mitigate the effects a project may have
                on the interests of persons and communities. The CER process
                acts as a necessary and important check on the engagement
                activities carried out by the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                The steps for the CER and the company to follow during the early
                engagement phase are highlighted below and include references to
                more detailed guidance material within this document.
                Appendix&nbsp;A provides a diagram of the steps in the early
                engagement phase.

                      The company identifies potentially affected persons and
                      communities. The company should request a preliminary
                      traditional territory analysis from the CER to obtain a
                      list of potentially impacted Indigenous communities that
                      should be included in engagement activities.

                      The company designs project-specific engagement activities
                      based on its Engagement Program. For each project,
                      companies are responsible to justify the extent of
                      engagement carried out and if applicable, justification
                      for not undertaking engagement activities.

                      The company sends an information package to all
                      potentially affected persons and communities identified in
                      step 1. The CER Early Engagement Guide includes the
                      minimum information required in the information package.

                      Project notification. The company notifies the CER of the
                      upcoming application (i.e., using the form included in
                      Appendix B of this document). This notification will be
                      provided to the CER at least six months in advance of
                      certificate applications, and at least two months in
                      advance of pipeline exemption order or electricity permit
                      applications. Based on this notification, the CER will:

              <h3>3. CER Expectations for the Early Engagement Phase</h3>
              <p>
                Detailed guidance regarding the steps defined in section&nbsp;2
                above, follows.
              </p>
              <h4>
                STEP&nbsp;1 &ndash; Identify potentially affected persons and
                communities
              </h4>
              <p>
                To enable successful early engagement it is critical that all
                potentially impacted persons and communities are identified as
                early as possible. For projects that are in close proximity to
                existing energy infrastructure, companies can rely on their
                ongoing public awareness programs for a list of directly
                affected persons and communities. The following guidance is
                provided to help identify those persons that may be affected by
                activities within the scope of the proposed project.
              </p>
              <h5>Indigenous Peoples</h5>
              <p>
                To identify which Indigenous communities may have asserted or
                established rights and/or interests in the project area or may
                be affected by a proposed project, the CER completes a
                traditional territory analysis. This analysis incorporates
                information provided by companies about their projects in order
                to identify traditional territories of Indigenous communities
                that may be intersected by a project. The CER relies on publicly
                available information on the traditional territory asserted by
                Indigenous communities, including information from previous
                projects or otherwise that was submitted directly to the
                regulator, when identifying Indigenous communities that may be
                affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indigenous communities potentially affected by the project can
                be identified by:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">

              </ul>
              <p>As defined in the Filing Manuals, traditional territory is:</p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-md lst-spck">
                <li>
                  An area where an Indigenous community has claimed or asserted
                  the right to use the land for traditional purposes such as
                  hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering or spiritual activities.
                  One or more Indigenous communities may claim the same lands as
                  their traditional territory.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Persons with an Interest in Lands Affected by the Project</h5>
              <p>
                The CER expects companies to identify and engage with
                individuals and communities who have rights and interests in
                lands affected by a proposed project. These rights and interests
                could be affected by:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  the company’s existing right of way(s) utilized for the
                  project;
                </li>
                <li>the acquisition or lease of lands;</li>
                <li>
                  temporary workspaces and areas, whether adjacent to or
                  accessed;
                </li>
                <li>project crossings of third party infrastructure;</li>
                <li>registered and unregistered rights to the lands; and</li>
                <li>operation of the prescribed area.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Persons Potentially Affected by the Project</h5>
              <p>
                The CER expects companies to engage with local residents, land
                users, and other persons that may be potentially affected by the
                proposed project. For example:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  any person who could be impacted by nuisance factors (noise,
                  dust, traffic, etc.) related to the construction and operation
                  of the proposed facility;
                </li>
                <li>
                  any users of registered or recognized hunting, trapping or
                  guiding areas and commercial and sport fishing areas;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  any users of recreation and park areas (including local and
                  provincial or territorial parks and recognized scenic areas);
                  and
                </li>
                <li>any person who resides in the emergency planning zone.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Government Authorities</h5>
              <p>
                The CER expects companies to ensure the appropriate government
                authorities (local, regional, provincial and federal) are
                included in the engagement activities. In some cases, regulatory
                approval or permits from another government authorities may be
                required. Contact that authority to determine their information
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CER expects companies to obtain all regulatory approvals or
                permits needed for a project. It is the company’s responsibility
                to determine what permits or approvals are required and to plan
                their project sequencing and scheduling accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Appendix&nbsp;C, while not exhaustive, identifies government
                authorities that might need to be contacted for certain
                projects. The list is intended for assistance and guidance only
                &ndash; companies are responsible for obtaining all necessary

              <p>
                The CER expects companies to consider engagement activities for
                all projects. Depending on the project scope, and relying on
                their Engagement Program, a company will determine whether that
                means carrying out extensive engagement activities, or a simple
                engagement activity such as notifying a single landowner, or not
                undertaking any engagement activities at all. Companies must
                justify the extent of engagement carried out for each project.
              </p>
              <p>

                There are opportunities available in the early engagement phase
                for companies to adopt a more collaborative approach. This may
                include, for example, involving potentially impacted persons and
                communities in field studies and site visits, or in scoping
                environmental and socio-economic assessments to identify
                community-appropriate valued components.

              <p>
                The CER expects companies to consider the distinct language
                needs of the potentially affected persons and/or communities and
                include a description of this consideration in their
                application. Further to section&nbsp;41 of the Official
                Languages Act, the CER is also committed to fostering the full
                recognition and use of both English and French in Canadian
                society. The CER recognizes the importance of considering
                official languages when developing and implementing an
                engagement program, to result in effective communication with
                potentially affected persons in the official language of their
                choice.
              </p>
              <h5>Engagement Methods</h5>
              <p>
                Communicate the project information in a format and manner that
                is appropriate to the audience. Determine the means of
                communicating project information in conjunction with the
                potentially affected persons or communities, if possible.
              </p>
              <p>Engagement methods may include but not be limited to:</p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>project brochures, either mailed or hand delivered;</li>
                <li>periodic newsletters;</li>
                <li>advertisements in local newspapers;</li>
                <li>radio spots;</li>

              <h5>Designing Engagement Activities for Indigenous Peoples</h5>
              <p>
                When considering project-specific engagement activities,
                companies are expected to design and effectively implement those
                activities so that they can seek to understand and address the
                interests and concerns of potentially impacted Indigenous
                communities. When engaging with potentially impacted Indigenous
                communities, companies should specifically seek to understand
                the rights of Indigenous peoples as they are asserted by the
                rights-holders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Companies should review the relevant Filing Manual and should
                engage with potentially impacted Indigenous communities, as soon
                as is practical in the planning and design phase of a project,
                in order to allow adequate time to discuss and understand the
                interests and concerns of each community. This type of early
                engagement should also allow companies to discuss and understand
                the practices and assertions related to the rights of each
                potentially impacted Indigenous community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Companies should work directly with Indigenous peoples to seek
                to understand and document their specific interests and
                concerns, as well as to understand and document values,
                practices, activities, customs or traditions that are connected
                to and are undertaken in relation to their rights as identified.
              </p>
              <p>
                When working with Indigenous communities, companies should
                design their engagement activities in such a way that will allow
                meaningful opportunities to understand and discuss interests and
                concerns identified, and how general or specific rights are
                being exercised. The source of Indigenous rights identified
                could be, for example, Treaties, legislation, or as established
                through case law. Identifying the source of the Indigenous
                rights asserted, claimed or established will allow for a better
                understanding of the right and by extension, how the ability to
                exercise the right may be impacted by the project. These
                discussions should critically inform details provided within a
                project application, including information pertaining to matters
                such as:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  the quality, quantity or distribution of resources involved in
                  interests identified, or required for the exercise of the
                  right (for example, any preferred wildlife or plant species
                  utilized, the cultural, ceremonial or nutritional uses or
                  importance of resources, and perception of quality, cultural
                  connections to a particular species);
                </li>
                <li>
                  access to the resources used or required in relation to the
                  interests identified or to the exercise of the right (for
                  example, physical access or travel ways to access culturally
                  important or harvesting locations, and distance from
                  communities of residence);
                </li>
                <li>
                  timing and seasonality in relation to the interests
                  identified, or for the exercise of rights, including how often
                  the Indigenous right may be practiced or exercised;
                </li>
                <li>
                  locations or areas of cultural importance where interests are
                  identified or Indigenous rights are exercised.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Companies should also work with Indigenous communities to
                ascertain whether any Indigenous knowledge is being provided in
                confidence, and if so, ensure that confidential Indigenous
                knowledge can be appropriately protected from unauthorized
                disclosure. Companies should strive to reach agreements or
                utilize existing community protocols with respect to Indigenous
                knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                When designing project-specific engagement activities, companies
                should also discuss with potentially affected Indigenous
                communities the measures that would support, improve or provide
                benefit to the exercise of Indigenous rights. Where such
                measures are proposed, or are recommended by potentially
                affected Indigenous communities, companies should provide
                meaningful opportunities for communities to consider the
                measures that are proposed and to respond to any measures and
                mitigation. Companies should also provide clear and timely
                feedback to any recommendations made by potentially affected
                Indigenous communities. The aim of engagement about mitigation
                and accommodation measures should be to seek to align interests
                and to address concerns or potential project effects to the
                extent possible.
              </p>
              <h5>Designing Engagement Activities for Emergency Management</h5>
              <p>
                Sections&nbsp;32 to&nbsp;35 of the OPR describe requirements for
                an Emergency Management Program which apply to a company’s
                operations. Effective emergency response planning requires
                liaison and engagement with federal, provincial, and municipal
                governments, Indigenous communities, and associated first
                responders. The CER assesses a company’s Emergency Management
                Program throughout operations, through its compliance
                verification activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                For a proposed project, it may also be appropriate to initiate
                engagement during the application process with those agencies
                and organizations that may be involved in an emergency response.
                The need for and depth of engagement with these agencies and
                organizations should be informed by:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  the assessment of potential risks associated with the project;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the level of public concern regarding emergency management
                  planning and emergency response associated with the project;
                  and
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  the extent to which an applicant’s emergency response plans
                  would interact with, and rely on those of first responders and
                  other agencies for initial or ongoing response activities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Agencies engaged with may include but would not be limited to:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>police;</li>
                <li>fire departments, including volunteer fire departments;</li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>emergency medical services;</li>
                <li>provincial emergency management organizations;</li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>provincial regulators and ministries of environment;</li>

                <li>spill co-operatives.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The goal of the engagement is to ensure that those agencies and
                organizations that may be involved in an emergency response
                related to a proposed project have been adequately engaged and
                that any concerns raised have been considered and addressed as
                appropriate. Companies are reminded to refer to guidance

              <h5>Justification for Not Undertaking Engagement Activities</h5>
              <p>
                For the majority of projects that involve the construction or
                modification of facilities that require an application under
                sections&nbsp;182, 214, 248, 262, or 298 of the Canadian Energy
                Regulator Act, the CER expects companies to undertake
                project-specific engagement activities. However, there may
                occasionally be projects where engagement is not required. The
                following sections provide guidance regarding situations where
                engagement activities may not be required:
              </p>
              <p><strong>Equivalent Engagement Activities</strong></p>
              <p>
                Engagement has already been undertaken as required by another
                agency or department and the company can demonstrate those
                activities are relevant to the current project and is equivalent
                to the CER’s guidance and requirements.
              </p>
              <p><strong>No or Negligible Impacts</strong></p>
              <p>
                Companies will be conducting environmental and socio-economic
                assessments of the project in accordance with the applicable
                requirements of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act and the Filing
                Manuals.
              </p>

              <p>
                Through their assessment process, companies will determine the
                potential adverse effects of the project. If the project's
                potential environmental and socio-economic effects are
                negligible, engagement activities might be unnecessary. A
                project with negligible effects might exist where many or all of
                the following conditions are met:

                Because the identification of potential impacts may depend on
                engagement with those people potentially affected, and because
                an impact assessment may not yet be completed, companies should
                generally be conservative when contemplating the possibility
                that engagement may not be necessary. When and where recent
                previous project assessments or engagements are relied on,
                relevant details of these should be cited in the Project
                Notification and the application to the CER.

              <p>
                Information packages must be given by the company to potentially
                affected persons and communities to provide them with necessary
                information, such as, details of the project, an explanation how
                the persons identified may be affected, and a description of how
                these people can engage with the company and the CER. Company
                information packages must be provided with enough time to allow
                for meaningful engagement to occur prior to the application
                being filed with the CER. Depending on the specific or distinct
                needs of the potentially affected persons and communities,
                company information packages could be delivered in one
                comprehensive package at a single point in time, or in a series
                of smaller packages delivered over an extended period of time.
                The contents of a company’s information package to potentially

              <h4>STEP&nbsp;4 &ndash; Ongoing Engagement Activities</h4>
              <p>
                Through the course of the early engagement phase, companies may
                identify other stakeholders that should be notified or engaged
                or additional discussion areas. Any developments or revisions in
                the early engagement phase should be documented, and addressed
                to the extent possible, for eventual submission to the CER in
                the application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the early engagement phase, the CER expects companies to
                address concerns, to the extent possible, before they become
                complaints; in that, the CER expects a company to:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  seek to understand the full nature of concerns expressed by
                  potentially impacted persons or communities;
                </li>
                <li>
                  consider the feasibility of any mitigation proposed by persons
                  or communities to address those concerns;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>respond to concerns; and</li>
                <li>
                  work with persons or communities to jointly resolve concerns.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The CER recognizes that engagement is an iterative process that
                will typically involve multiple conversations with different
                people. At some point in the early engagement phase, depending
                on the particular project, companies will likely have to get
                input on general route selection. For example, the CER expects
                companies to be in a position to clearly demonstrate: 1) how the
                proposed project is the most appropriate option to meet the
                needs that would be satisfied by the project while serving the
                public interest; and, 2) how the input and concerns they receive
                from potentially impacted persons, including potentially
                affected landowners and Indigenous communities, have influenced
                the design (including general route selection), construction or
                operation of their project.

              <h5>Pre-Application Meetings</h5>
              <p>
                The CER is committed to ensuring that companies are provided
                with opportunities to fully understand the CER’s processes.
                Pre-application meetings between companies and CER staff are one
                of the options to promote a better understanding of the CER’s
                application process and regulatory requirements. While CER staff
                cannot provide the company with any specific guidance on the
                proposed project or any substantive issues, pre-application
                meetings give everyone the opportunity to:
              </p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>share process information and establish contacts;</li>
                <li>discuss filing requirements; and</li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>identify additional resources for information.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To assist companies in determining whether a pre-application
                meeting would be beneficial, the CER has posted on its website
                “Pre-Application Meeting Guidance Notes”<sup id="fn19-rf"
                  ><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19"

                  ></sup
                >, which include a company checklist. These Guidance Notes
                provide details on the objectives of pre-application meetings,
                discuss how to request a meeting and identify what companies can
                expect during a pre-application meeting.

                The CER strongly encourages companies to request a preliminary
                traditional territory analysis before this step in the early
                engagement process if there is any uncertainty about the
                potentially affected Indigenous communities (e.g., greenfield
                projects, companies that do not have existing relationships with
                Indigenous communities in the area of the project, or companies
                that are not familiar with building linear energy
                infrastructure). Given the possibility of changes to a project
                between when the company submits a project notification to the
                CER and when the company submits a project application to the
                CER, the CER will confirm the final Crown List when the
                application is filed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the information in the Project Notification Form, the
                CER will make decisions about whether any CER-led engagement
                activities are needed with the public and Indigenous
                communities. Typically, the CER will design and implement
                engagement activities for certificate applications. Issues that
                are identified during CER-led engagement activities will be
                provided to the company and posted on the Regulator’s website
                within the applicable 2-month or 6-month period. The input may
                also inform the design of the CER’s hearing process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CER will inform companies about the initial Crown list of
                potentially affected Indigenous communities and its decision
                whether to conduct any CER-led engagement activities by issuing
                and publicly posting a “Receipt of Project Notification”.
              </p>
              <h4>STEP&nbsp;6 &ndash; Request CER ADR services as required</h4>
              <p>
                The CER encourages open and respectful discussion between
                companies and people that are affected by CER-regulated proposed
                projects and facilities. Through its ADR services, the CER can
                help companies and potentially affected persons work through
                disputes and find practical solutions to issues of disagreement
                during the early engagement phase and at any stage of the
                hearing process. The Commission may take the results of the ADR
                process into account when making a decision, order or
                recommendation and may refer to them in the decision, order or
                recommendation.
              </p>
              <p>
                ADR is a collection of processes and techniques that can be used
                to revolve issues as an addition to a traditional hearing
                process. ADR aims to be collaborative and respectful of
                everyone’s point of view. The CER promotes collaborative
                outcomes through ADR, in the use of facilitated meetings and
                mediations with ADR specialists.
              </p>
              <p>
                ADR can be requested at any time during the early engagement
                phase and the hearing process; experience has shown successful
                outcomes can be achieved the earlier the ADR services are
                accessed. The CER can utilize internal and external ADR
                specialists who have accredited certification in negotiation,
                facilitation and mediation to assist in evaluating options for
                resolving issues. The CER ADR specialists work with potentially
                affected persons and the company to design and plan for a
                process to assist in reaching a mutually satisfactory outcome on
                unresolved issues.
              </p>
              <p>Some of the benefits of ADR include:</p>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>flexible and supports respectful discussions;</li>
                <li>
                  mutually acceptable outcomes that can be practical and meet
                  specific needs;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>
                  settlements are decided by the participants and are not
                  imposed by the CER; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  ADR can occur in parallel to, and complement, the hearing
                  process.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Companies and potentially affected persons and communities are
                encouraged to use the CER’s ADR services. ADR is voluntary and
                its results are not binding. If all the participants to a
                dispute request then the CER must provide ADR. The results of
                ADR are not made public, unless both parties agree, but may be
                taken into account by the CER when making a decision on a
                project.

                Applications for an Order or Permit)
              </h4>
              <p>
                After submitting an application for an order under
                section&nbsp;214, a permit under section&nbsp;248, or an
                authorization under section&nbsp;298, a company is expected to
                immediately notify potentially affected persons and communities
                that the application has been filed with the CER. The notice
                should indicate that people can raise any project-related
                concerns with the CER. The CER encourages people to submit any
                concerns about the project as soon as possible and preferably
                within 14&nbsp;days after they receive notice of the
                application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regarding this step, companies are not expected to proactively
                notify potentially affected persons and communities for
                applications for a certificate under sections&nbsp;182 or 262 of
                the Canadian Energy Regulator Act. In these situations, the CER
                will hold public hearings to consider the applications, and the
                CER will specify the form of notice (for example, a CER hearing
                order, a CER notice of application) that companies must provide
                to all potentially affected persons and communities.
              </p>
              <h5>4. Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The CER’s regulatory oversight typically spans the entire life
                of the regulated infrastructure, including a pipeline or a
                powerline, subject only to any authorities which cede to another
                regulatory body (i.e., a provincial body). Early engagement is
                just the first of many processes designed to support
                participation in CER-regulated infrastructure projects. Early
                engagement is followed by the application assessment process,
                which in turn is followed by open and transparent compliance
                processes during the construction and operation phases of
                approved facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the early engagement phase, the CER expects companies to
                continue to conduct effective engagement during the application
                phase.

                Filing Manual provide guidance about the regulator’s
                expectations during this phase. The CER also expects companies
                to continue to conduct effective engagement during construction
                and operation; the CER’s expectations related to operations and
                maintenance activities on pipelines can be found on the CER’s

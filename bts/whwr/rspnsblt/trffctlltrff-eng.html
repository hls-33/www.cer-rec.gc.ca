              <h2 id="s1">Overview</h2>
              <p>
                The CER regulates pipeline tolls and tariffs under its
                jurisdiction so that they are just and reasonable. We also
                regulate so that there is no unjust discrimination in tolls,
                service or facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pipeline companies regulated by the CER are divided into two
                groups for financial regulatory purposes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Group&nbsp;1 consists of those pipeline companies with
                  extensive systems and several third-party shippers
                </li>
                <li>
                  Group&nbsp;2 consists of the remaining pipeline companies that
                  operate smaller, less complex pipelines with few or no
                  third-party shippers
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To reduce the regulatory burden on smaller companies, we
                regulate on a complaint basis two of the Group&nbsp;1 pipelines
                and all of the Group&nbsp;2 companies. Under complaint-based
                regulation, the affected parties are encouraged to work out any
                problems with the pipeline company. If this is unsuccessful,
                they may file a complaint with the CER.
              </p>
              <p>
                When establishing tolls for the Group&nbsp;1 companies, we
                typically follow one of two processes. The first option is to
                assess a detailed tolls application filed by the company. In
                most cases, this filing leads to a formal public hearing before
                the CER. After hearing the evidence and arguments of all
                parties, we will issue our reasons for decision on all matters
                examined during the hearing. Tolls set during this process cover
                the company’s cost of service, including a fair and reasonable
                return to pipeline investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second process option is for us to consider a negotiated
                toll settlement reached between the pipeline company, its
                shippers and other stakeholders. If negotiations are successful,
                the pipeline company will file a document that details the terms
                of the settlement and request CER approval. We will assess the
                settlement against our Guidelines for Negotiated Settlements of
                Traffic, Tolls and Tariffs (dated June&nbsp;12, 2002) to ensure
                the settlement yields just and reasonable tolls, and that no
                terms in the settlement are contrary to the Settlement
                Guidelines. We will also ask for comments from the company’s
                shippers and other stakeholders, to consider their support for
                the settlement. Some of the largest pipeline companies we
                regulate have reached multi-year incentive toll settlements with
                their shippers and other stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, tolls for services provided under similar
                circumstances and conditions must be the same for all customers.
              </p>
              <h2 id="s2">Regulatory processes</h2>
              <p>
                The CER is a court of record, and our decisions and reasons for
                decision are public documents. Applications and complaints about
                traffic, tolls and tariffs may be filed with us at any time.
                When examining tolls, we can decide whether an oral or written
                public hearing is needed. We seek input from interested parties
                before making a decision on an application or complaint.
              </p>
              <h2 id="s3">Tariffs</h2>
              <p>
                A pipeline company cannot charge a toll unless it is included in
                a tariff filed with the CER or approved by a Commission order.
                This tariff may also include terms and conditions about a
                shipper's access to the pipeline, as well as the rights and
                responsibilities of both the pipeline company and the shipper
                once service begins.
              </p>
              <p>
                A pipeline company's tariff contains the conditions under which
                transportation service is provided. The tariff includes
                conditions related to accepting new shippers, allocating
                capacity to shippers, and describing the type of service offered
                and associated terms as the quality of hydrocarbons and
                financial assurances requirements for shippers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pipeline companies must operate according to the principle of
                open access. This means that all parties must have access to
                transportation without discrimination, as long as they meet the
                requirements of the tariff. A gas pipeline company's tariff may
                contain conditions for open season and access procedures, the
                minimum duration of contracts, renewal requirements and the
                bidding process used to secure interruptible service.
              </p>
              <h2 id="s4">Traffic</h2>
              <p>
                There are two types of pipeline carriers: common carriers and
                contract carriers.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common carrier must accept all products offered to it for
                transportation. When there is not enough capacity for the
                volumes offered (and unless the Commission has approved an
                alternative methodology), the pipeline company prorates its
                available capacity to accommodate all shippers. This gives all
                parties an equal proportion of the amount initially requested.
                We make sure that access to and allocation of capacity is fair.
              </p>
              <p>
                Historically, oil pipelines (that is, pipelines that carry oil,
                natural gas liquids and petroleum products) operated as common
                carriers. Some oil pipelines are now requiring long-term
                take-or-pay agreements for a portion of the pipeline’s capacity,
                before construction begins. To date, all oil pipelines that have
                contracted capacity have also kept some capacity available for
                common carriage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Contract carriers require a contract before accepting a product
                for transportation. Natural gas pipelines are operated as
                contract carriers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1996, the CER obtained jurisdiction over interprovincial and
                international pipelines that carry commodities other than
                hydrocarbons. These include steam, brine, chemicals, pulp or
                coal slurry, alone or combined with hydrocarbons. To date, all
                of these pipelines have been designated as Group&nbsp;2
                pipelines and are regulated on a complaint basis. (See section
                on <a href="#s5_3">Complaint-based regulation</a> below.)
              </p>
              <h2 id="s5">Toll regulation</h2>
              <p>
                Until the mid-1990s, the main method of regulation was cost of
                service. Under this approach, companies came before the CER,
                often each year, to determine the amount of revenue the pipeline
                company was allowed to recover through its tolls.
              </p>
              <p>
                To improve the effectiveness of the regulatory process, we have
                supported the use of negotiated settlements since the mid-1980s
                as an alternative to toll hearings. In September 1988, we issued
                our first Guidelines for Negotiated Settlements of Traffic,
                Tolls and Tariffs. These guidelines were updated in August 1994,
                and revised again in June 2002 to provide flexibility when
                addressing contested settlements. (For more information, see the
                <a href="#s5_2">Negotiated settlements</a> section below.)
              </p>
              <h3 id="s5_1">Cost-of-service regulation</h3>
              <p>
                A toll change in the context of cost-of-service regulation
                requires that a company file a toll application with the
                supporting documentation specified in
                <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/flngmnl/fmgdp-eng.html">Guide&nbsp;P</a>
                of the CER’s Filing Manual. We then hold a public hearing to
                allow input from interested parties. After considering the
                evidence and arguments of all parties, we issue a decision
                approving final tolls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under this cost-of-service approach, a pipeline company's tolls
                are set so investors can recover costs and earn a reasonable
                return on their investment. To set tolls, most companies
                forecast their cost of service and throughput for a forward test
                year(s). The cost of service is made up of operating expenses,
                depreciation, return on capital, and income and other taxes. We
                allow a pipeline company the opportunity to earn an approved
                rate of return.
              </p>
              <p>In determining the rate of return, we consider whether:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the pipeline can attract capital on reasonable terms and
                  conditions
                </li>
                <li>
                  the allowed return is comparable to the return available to
                  other companies of similar risk
                </li>
                <li>
                  the financial integrity of the regulated pipeline will be
                  maintained
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="s5_2">Negotiated settlements</h3>
              <p>
                Beginning in the mid-1990s, the CER approved a succession of
                multi-year negotiated settlements. These settlements often
                include incentives to reduce costs and provisions to share
                savings between the pipeline company and its shippers. In some
                cases, settlements have included various innovative performance
                mechanisms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Guidelines for Negotiated Settlements of Traffic, Tolls and
                Tariffs clarify our role and establish acceptable criteria for
                the settlement process. Generally, we want to make sure all
                interested parties have a fair opportunity to participate in the
                settlement process and that there is a general acceptance of the
                outcome. The guidelines have facilitated the resolution of
                specific toll matters and also the development of incentive
                regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The existence of a negotiated settlement does not limit the
                CER’s authority. In considering whether to approve a settlement,
                we take into account the views of all interested parties as well
                as broader public interest concerns, including potential impacts
                upon public safety and protection of the environment. We either
                accept or reject a settlement package in its entirety. A
                settlement which is unopposed may allow us to determine that the
                resulting tolls will be just and reasonable without a public
                hearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the case of a contested settlement, we can choose one of
                three options:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>dismiss the objections and approve the settlement</li>
                <li>deny the settlement and refer the matter for hearing</li>
                <li>
                  approve the terms of the settlement on an interim basis and
                  then hold a hearing to address the issues raised by dissenting
                  parties (more information about
                  <a href="/bts/whwr/rspnsblt/trffctlltrff-eng.html#s7"
                    >Tolls on an interim basis</a
                  >

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Light-handed regulation is one form of negotiated settlement
                used for gathering and processing facilities on the Westcoast
                Energy system. Under the Framework for Light-handed Regulation
                which was established to address unique competitive issues on
                those facilities, the pipeline negotiates tolls individually
                with its customers based on a number of factors.
              </p>
              <h3 id="s5_3">Complaint-based regulation</h3>
              <p>
                In&nbsp;1985, the CER concluded that smaller pipelines under our
                jurisdiction should be subject to a lighter degree of toll and
                tariff regulation. We divided pipeline companies into two
                groups:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Group&nbsp;1 companies that operate extensive pipeline systems
                </li>
                <li>Group&nbsp;2 companies that operate smaller pipelines</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are currently 13&nbsp;Group&nbsp;1 companies and
                approximately 100&nbsp;Group&nbsp;2 companies, including
                13&nbsp;commodity pipelines companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use a complaint-based approach for the financial regulation
                of Group&nbsp;2 companies. This method of regulation is
                described in each company's tariff. The pipeline company is
                responsible for providing shippers and other interested persons
                with enough information so they can determine whether the tolls
                are reasonable. Once filed with the CER, the tariffs containing
                new tolls automatically become effective. If a complaint is
                filed, we may establish a procedure to examine tolls. If no
                complaint is filed, we may presume that the filed tolls are just
                and reasonable. Overall, this approach has resulted in few
                complaints.
              </p>
              <h2 id="s6">Toll design</h2>
              <p>
                Toll design is the process of deriving tolls for different
                services and different distances from the cost of service or
                revenue requirement and throughput or contracted quantities.
                Tolls should generate sufficient revenue to recover approved
                costs, and at the same time fairly allocate charges to users in
                relation to the costs and benefits of different services. The
                basic principle is user pay.
              </p>
              <p>
                Toll design divides costs between the various functions
                performed by the pipeline system, such as transmission and
                metering, and then determines costs and usage of those
                functions. Some costs are common to every unit of throughput.
                Other costs may depend upon variables such as the distance
                shipped, and still other costs may be unique to a particular
                type or class of shipper.
              </p>
              <p>
                With additions to an existing pipeline, there may be toll issues
                about whether expansion costs should be rolled into a single,
                existing rate base and charged to all shippers equally
                (rolled-in methodology) or kept separate and charged only to
                particular shippers (incremental methodology). In deciding such
                matters, we consider several factors, such as whether the new
                facilities would be used to provide a new distinct service which
                would be used only by certain shippers, or an expansion of an
                existing service which would provide a benefit to the entire
                system.
              </p>
              <h2 id="s7">Tolls on an interim basis</h2>
              <p>
                We can only consider toll adjustments on a forward &ndash; or
                prospective &ndash; basis. In situations where the desired
                effective date for new tolls will have passed before a decision
                on final tolls can be made, we may issue an order allowing the
                company to charge tolls on an interim basis until the final toll
                order is issued. The tolls contained in the final order can then
                be made effective from the date of the interim order. Refunds or
                charges that result from the difference between interim and
                final tolls usually include interest charges.

              <p>
                Unless specifically exempted, a Group&nbsp;1 pipeline company
                must file a surveillance report at the end of each quarter based
                on the Toll Information Regulations.
                <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/flngmnl/fmgdbb-eng.html"

                of the Filing Manual outlines the information and the format of
                surveillance reports. These reports provide details of financial
                performance and explain any significant variations from approved
                amounts. Through these reports, the CER and interested
                stakeholders can monitor the results for each company over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                We normally require all Group&nbsp;2 companies to file audited
                financial statements each year. However, Group&nbsp;2 companies,
                chiefly those with no third-party shippers, may seek an
                exemption from this filing requirement.

              <p>
                The CER’s Gas Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations and Oil
                Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations establish a uniform
                system of accounts for Group&nbsp;1 companies. This provides for
                the recording of costs in a consistent manner. Group&nbsp;2
                companies are required to keep their accounts in accordance with
                generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We can audit a
                pipeline company's records to ensure the accuracy of filed
                documents and compliance with the CER Act, regulations,
                decisions, toll orders and other accounting and reporting
                directives. (See

            The National Energy Board regulates pipelines, power lines, energy
            development and trade and is operating in a rapidly changing context
            defined by increased interest from Canadians in Canada&rsquo;s
            energy system. This system is broad and interconnected; it is
            influenced by federal, provincial and international policies and
            commitments, regulatory actions, company behaviors, financial
            markets and public perception. It touches the lives of Canadians
            every day and affects what matters to them: their lands, water,
            environment, jobs, communities, safety, and wellbeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Canada&rsquo;s federal energy regulator, the NEB knows it has a
            vital role to play in this system. What Canadians need is a credible
            regulator that provides assurance that it is doing its part to
            protect what matters to them.  Our success in this new context
            demands that we demonstrate the greatest diligence in our operations
            in our pursuit of regulatory excellence.

          <h2>Defining Regulatory Excellence</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB&rsquo;s first step towards defining regulatory excellence
            started in 2015. We turned to renowned thought leaders and their
            research. We joined the Alberta Energy Regulator to discuss their
            work in this regard, commissioned to the University of
            Pennsylvania&rsquo;s (UPenn) Regulatory Program (<a
              href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/4946-pprfinalconvenersreport.pdf"
              >Listening, Learning, Leading – A Framework for Regulatory
              Excellence</a
            >). We also wanted to validate these findings by comparing them to
            other bodies of research and testing them through our expert
            networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            We joined the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
            Development&rsquo;s (OECD)
            <a href="http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/ner.htm"
              >Network of Economic Regulators</a
            >
            in late 2015, and we also partnered with other energy regulators
            through the <a href="https://ppforum.ca/">Public Policy Forum</a> to
            convene three expert summits on regulatory excellence in early
            2016.These channels offered an invaluable wealth of best practices
            formed by a cross section of agencies from Canada and around the
            world. We listened to their approaches, shared our own, and tested
            our real world experience against the research.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we found is that regulatory excellence is not a single action
            or a series of individual inputs. Rather, it is the sum of multiple,
            connected attributes that inspire and influence our staff and Board
            Members every day, at every level, in a systematic way. The three
            attributes commonly found in excellent regulators as defined by
            UPenn are: <strong>utmost integrity</strong>,
            <strong>empathic engagement</strong> and
            <strong>stellar competence</strong>. We are confident that these
            three attributes, consistent with the public service values we have
            already internalized, can help the NEB build trust with Canadians,
            especially in times of change.

          <h2>A Framework for Implementing Regulatory Excellence</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB&rsquo;s framework for implementing Regulatory Excellence
            takes a systemic approach to embedding utmost integrity, stellar
            competency and empathic engagement into our work. The attributes are
            integrated into our core responsibilities and our progress in
            pursuit of regulatory excellence is measured in the outcomes listed
            in our Departmental Results Framework.

          <p>
            The NEB&rsquo;s Management System provides the necessary business
            planning, risk and data management and governance to enable the
            organization to deliver the outcomes described in our
            <a href="/bts/whwr/gvrnnc/dprtmntlrsltfrmwrk/index-eng.html"
              >Departmental Results Framework</a
            >. Relentless focus on organizational improvement is imbedded
            throughout our Management System by continually enforcing the
            &ldquo;Plan, Do, Check and Adjust&rdquo; cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Departmental Results Framework sets a clear direction for the
            NEB. It illustrates exactly what we do and what we aim to achieve
            through our four core responsibilities: Energy Adjudication, Safety
            and Environment Oversight, Energy Information and Engagement. These
            four core responsibilities deliver tangible and meaningful outcomes
            for Canadians. With help from our Management System, we will
            continually monitor our progress on delivering these outcomes
            through the development and use of performance indicators. These
            performance indicators are focused on the external environment; they
            track our performance and how effective we are at influencing and
            improving industry performance. These performance indicators keep us
            on the right path and help us continually improve our internal
            actions and decisions so we can deliver results for Canadians.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to be meaningful for Canadians, these performance
            indicators need to reflect the information stakeholders want to see.
            We reached out to stakeholders across Canada to understand what
            information they would like to see about our performance and
            developed performance indicators that reflect the interests we
            serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each and every day, our 490 dedicated staff and Board Members
            contribute to achieving these outcomes and thus, Regulatory
            Excellence. Our staff delivers energy adjudication processes that
            are fair, timely, transparent and accessible; prevent harm to people
            or the environment throughout the lifecycle of energy-related
            activities; provide Canadians energy information for knowledge,
            research or decision-making; and engage meaningfully with
            stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples to hear their perspectives and
            provide feedback regarding the NEB and our role.

          <h2>Regulatory Excellence in Action</h2>
          <p>
            Our <em>Energy Adjudication</em> responsibility requires that we
            deliver processes that are fair, timely, transparent, and
            accessible. The NEB has seen an unprecedented number of participants
            in its hearings recently who come with varying levels of resources
            to navigate the NEB&rsquo;s regulatory process. We believe that all
            participants, regardless of resources, should be able to
            meaningfully participate. NEB staff should engage professionally
            throughout all of our interactions with stakeholders. Even if a
            stakeholder does not agree with a decision or recommendation, they
            should feel as though they were able to meaningfully participate in
            our review process and their concerns were listened to and
            respectfully considered.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a project is approved, our job is just beginning and we need to
            assure Canadians that we are holding companies accountable
            throughout the entire lifecycle. This means clearly demonstrating
            the actions and decisions we take every day to prevent harm to
            people, the environment and property.  When carrying out our
            <em>Safety and Environment Oversight</em> over the life of an energy
            infrastructure project, we perform ongoing assessments of company
            performance, including their management systems and emergency
            preparedness and perform careful analysis of trends, emerging
            technologies and the root-cause of non-compliances and incidents.
            This internal work must be shared with Canadians. We must
            demonstrate the greatest diligence and transparency with gathering
            all condition compliances, inspection reports, enforcement actions
            and incident data. This information is critical in assuring
            Canadians that we are protecting what matters to them and holding
            companies accountable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Determining compliance through tools such as inspections and audits
            is an essential part of what the NEB does and it does not stop
            there.  Going beyond compliance and looking at improvements in
            company management systems is essential in preventing future
            non-compliances and incidents.  This is done through a variety of
            regulatory tools such as further audits, investigations and/or
            safety orders.  We also push beyond company level performance in
            order to influence at an industry level.  This is moving the bar on
            prevention through improved safety and environment performance from
            minimum standards to best practice and examining our data and
            trending to focus from company specific activities to sector-wide
            outcomes and safety culture.

            As we seek to positively influence industry&rsquo;s safety culture,
            we must also consider how our own deeply-held organizational values
            affect decision-making and behaviors in the regulatory system. For
            this reason, the NEB has begun efforts to understand and evaluate
            our own internal culture. We are developing a regulator safety
            (oversight) culture assessment tool to begin to measure and improve
            as a Regulator.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to provide accurate, neutral and trustworthy
            <em>Energy Information</em> to Canadians. We want our energy
            information to play an active role in helping Canadians
            knowledgeably participate in discussions on energy systems and
            pipeline safety. To this end, we are also doing more to report on
            topics like emerging technologies and renewable energy as well as
            new ways to convey information in simpler, more intuitive ways.  In
            response to what the NEB heard in a variety of engagement settings,
            the NEB is committed to enhancing its pipeline information on safety
            and environmental matters to enable it to be accessed by regions and
            communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe Canadians should have the opportunity to remain engaged
            throughout the lifecycle so that both our regulatory processes and
            the regulatory framework are informed by, and improved as a result
            of, engagement with landowners, regions, communities and Indigenous
            Peoples. Through our <em>Engagement </em>responsibility, the NEB is
            committed to engaging meaningfully with a regional and community
            approach.  Our regional offices in Vancouver, Montréal and
            Yellowknife will help us proactively engage at the regional level
            and use a sustained, cooperative approach to addressing
            communities&rsquo; concerns and interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our regulatory framework – the requirements we set out in
            regulations and other regulatory tools - evolves as we incorporate
            lessons learned through all of our core responsibility work. We also
            learn from other expert regulators within the oil and gas industry
            and other high hazard industries, and the ongoing technical training
            we prioritize for our expert staff. The NEB has a program to
            systematically and strategically review, update and develop its
            regulations over time. We provide information on our website on
            planned regulatory improvement initiatives that we expect to bring
            forward over the next two years.
          </p>
          <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
          <p>
            Regulatory Excellence is not a one-time exercise. The NEB will have
            to continually assess itself through use of our Management System
            and Departmental Results Framework in order to seize unrecognized
            opportunities and take proactive action against potential weaknesses
            and risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regulatory Excellence is not only reputational, or about saying we
            are excellent. Performance indicators that provide Canadians with
            meaningful proxies for <strong>utmost integrity</strong>,
            <strong>empathic engagement</strong> and
            <strong>stellar competence</strong> are necessary to give evidence
            to our claim. The NEB deliberately selected the term
            &ldquo;Regulatory Excellence&rdquo;, as opposed to
            &ldquo;best-in-class&rdquo; or &ldquo;world-class&rdquo;. For us,
            excellence is not merely a position among peers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, Regulatory Excellence is not about perfection nor does it
            happen by chance - it is a perpetual pursuit. We will never
            &ldquo;complete&rdquo; our goal of being excellent but will continue
            to set higher performance targets for ourselves over time. We have
            the humility required to take an honest assessment of where we can
            improve and we welcome Canadians to help us in driving this pursuit.

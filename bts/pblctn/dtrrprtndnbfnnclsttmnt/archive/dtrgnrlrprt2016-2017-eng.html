          <p><strong>INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT</strong></p>
          <p>To the Chair of the National Energy Board</p>
          <p><strong>Report on the Financial Statements</strong></p>
          <p>
            I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the National
            Energy Board, which comprise the statement of financial position as
            at 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2017, and the statement of operations and net
            financial position, statement of change in net debt and statement of
            cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant
            accounting policies and other explanatory information.
          </p>
          <p>Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements</p>
          <p>
            Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
            of these financial statements in accordance with Canadian public
            sector accounting standards, and for such internal control as
            management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
            financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
            whether due to fraud or error.
          </p>
          <p>Auditor's Responsibility</p>
          <p>
            My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
            statements based on my audit. I&nbsp;conducted my audit in
            accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards.
            Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and
            plan and perform the audit&nbsp;to obtain reasonable assurance about
            whether the financial statements are free from material
            misstatement.
          </p>
          <p>
            An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence
            about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
            procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the
            assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
            statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
            assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
            entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial
            statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
            in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
            opinion on the effectiveness of&nbsp;the&nbsp;entity's internal
            control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
            accounting&nbsp;policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
            estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
            presentation of the financial statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and
            appropriate to provide a&nbsp;basis&nbsp;for my audit opinion.
          </p>
          <p>Opinion</p>
          <p>
            In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
            material respects, the financial position of the National Energy
            Board as at 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2017, and the results of its
            operations, changes in its net debt, and its cash flows for the year
            then ended in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting
            standards.

          <p>
            In my opinion, the transactions of the National Energy Board that
            have come to my notice during my audit of the financial statements
            have, in all significant respects, been in accordance with
            Section&nbsp;24.1(1) of the National Energy Board Act and the
            National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations.

          <p>
            Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the accompanying
            financial statements for the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2017 and all
            information contained in these statements rests with the management
            of the National Energy Board (NEB). These financial statements have
            been prepared by management using the Government’s accounting
            policies, which are based on Canadian public sector accounting
            standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the
            information in these financial statements. Some of the information
            in the financial statements is based on management's best estimates
            and judgment and gives due consideration to materiality. To fulfil
            its accounting and reporting responsibilities, management maintains
            a set of accounts that provides a centralized record of the NEB’s
            financial transactions. Financial information submitted in the
            preparation of the Public Accounts of Canada, and included in the
            NEB’s Departmental Performance Report is consistent with these
            financial statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management is also responsible for maintaining an effective system
            of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) designed to
            provide reasonable assurance that financial information is reliable,
            that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly
            authorized and recorded in accordance with the Financial
            Administration Act and other applicable legislation, regulations,
            authorities and policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management seeks to ensure the objectivity and integrity of data in
            its financial statements through careful selection, training, and
            development of qualified staff; through organizational arrangements
            that provide appropriate divisions of responsibility; through
            communication programs aimed at ensuring that regulations, policies,
            standards, and managerial authorities are understood throughout the
            NEB and through conducting an annual risk-based assessment of the
            effectiveness of the system of ICFR.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system of ICFR is designed to mitigate risks to a reasonable
            level based on an on-going process to identify key risks, to assess
            effectiveness of associated key controls, and to make any necessary
            adjustments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB will be subject to periodic Core Control Audits performed by
            the Office of the Comptroller General and will use the results of
            such audits to adhere to the Treasury Board Policy on Internal
            Control.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the interim, the NEB has undertaken a risk-based assessment of
            the system of ICFR for the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2017, in
            accordance with the Treasury Board Policy on Internal Control, and
            the results and action plan is summarized in the annex.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Office of the Auditor General, the independent auditor for the
            Government of Canada, has expressed an opinion on the fair
            presentation of the financial statements of the NEB which does not
            include an audit opinion on the annual assessment of the
            effectiveness of the department’s internal controls over financial
            reporting.

            The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is an independent
            federal quasi-judicial regulatory tribunal established in 1959 to
            promote safety and security, environmental protection and economic
            efficiency in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set by
            Parliament for the regulation of pipelines, energy development and
            trade. The Board is accountable to Parliament through the Minister
            of Natural Resources. The NEB was established under the National
            Energy Board Act (NEB Act) and is designated as a department and
            named under Schedule&nbsp;I.1 of the Financial Administration Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board's responsibilities can be framed into the following
            program alignment architecture which is also the basis for its

              <br />
              The Board’s responsibilities include regulating the construction
              and operation of interprovincial and international oil and gas
              pipelines, international power lines, and designated
              interprovincial power lines. The Board also regulates the tolls
              and tariffs of the pipelines under its jurisdiction as well as the
              export of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids and electricity,
              and the import of natural gas. Additionally, the Board regulates
              oil and gas exploration and development on frontier lands and
              offshore areas not covered by provincial or federal management
              agreements.

              Under this program, the supply, demand, production, development,
              transmission and trade of energy are analyzed to ensure the
              requirements of Canadians are appropriately met. Advice is
              provided on energy issues of interest. The NEB uses energy
              information to inform its regulatory decisions and to produce
              publicly available assessments of energy trends, events and issues
              that may affect Canadian energy markets and the supply and demand
              for energy.

              Internal Services<br />
              <br />
              Internal services are groups of related activities and resources
              that are administered to support the needs of programs and other
              corporate obligations of an organization. Internal services
              include only those activities and resources that apply across an
              organization, and not those provided to a specific program.

            witnesses; the production and inspection of documents; the
            enforcement of its orders; the entry on and inspection of property;
            and other matters necessary or proper for the due exercise of its
            jurisdiction. Aside from rare exceptions, the Board's regulatory
            decisions and the accompanying Reasons for Decision are issued as

            The financial statements of the National Energy Board have been
            prepared as at March&nbsp;31 which corresponds with the Board’s
            year-end. In accordance with Section&nbsp;24.1 of the NEB Act, the
            Board may, for the purposes of recovering all or a portion of such
            costs as the Board determines to be attributable to its
            responsibilities under this or any other Act of Parliament, make
            regulations to impose fees, levies or charges. The NEB Cost Recovery
            Regulations provide for the calculation and allocation of
            recoverable costs. Cost recovery calculations performed on a
            calendar year basis are included in a Schedule to these financial
            statements. The NEB is funded through parliamentary appropriations.
            The Government of Canada recovers approximately 95&nbsp;percent of
            the appropriation from the regulated industry. The revenues are
            deposited directly into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This process
            is regulated by the National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations.

          <p><strong>2. Summary of significant accounting policies</strong></p>
          <p>
            These financial statements have been prepared using the Government’s
            accounting policies stated below, which are based on Canadian public
            sector accounting standards. The presentation and results using the
            stated accounting policies do not result in any significant
            differences from Canadian public sector accounting standards.
          </p>
          <p>Significant accounting policies are as follows:</p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">

              Parliamentary authorities<br />
              <br />
              The NEB is financed by the Government of Canada through
              Parliamentary authorities. Financial reporting of authorities
              provided to the NEB do not parallel financial reporting according
              to generally accepted accounting principles since authorities are
              primarily based on cash flow requirements. Consequently, items
              recognized in the Statement of Operations and Net Financial
              Position and the Statement of Financial Position are not
              necessarily the same as those provided through authorities from
              Parliament. Note&nbsp;3 provides a high-level reconciliation
              between the bases of reporting. The planned results amounts in the
              “Expenses” and “Revenues” section of the Statement of Operations
              and Net Financial Position are the amounts reported in the
              2016-2017 Report on Plans and Priorities. The planned results
              amounts in the “Government funding and transfers” section of the
              Statement of Operations and Net Financial Position and in the
              Statement of Change in Net Debt were prepared for internal
              management purposes and have not been previously published.<br />
              <br />
              Liquidity risk is the risk that the Board will encounter
              difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial
              liabilities. The NEB’s objective for managing liquidity risk is to
              manage operations and cash expenditures within the appropriation
              authorized by Parliament or allotment limits approved by the
              Treasury Board.<br />
              <br />
              Each year, the Board presents information on planned expenditures
              to Parliament through the tabling of Estimates publications. These
              estimates result in the introduction of supply bills (which, once
              passed into legislation, become appropriation acts) in accordance
              with the reporting cycle for government expenditures. The Board
              exercises expenditure initiation processes such that unencumbered
              balances of budget allotments and appropriations are monitored and
              reported on a regular basis to help ensure sufficient authority
              remains for the entire period and appropriations are not
              exceeded.<br />
              <br />
              Consistent with Section&nbsp;32 of the Financial Administration
              Act, the Board’s policy to manage liquidity risk is that no
              contract or other arrangement providing for a payment shall be
              entered into with respect to any program for which there is an
              appropriation by Parliament or an item included in estimates then
              before the House of Commons to which the payment will be charged
              unless there is a sufficient unencumbered balance available out of
              the appropriation or item to discharge any debt that, under the
              contract or other arrangement, will be incurred during the fiscal
              year in which the contract or other arrangement is entered
              into.<br />
              <br />
              The NEB’s risk exposure and its objectives, policies and processes
              to manage and measure this risk did not change significantly from
              the prior year.

              Net cash provided by Government<br />
              <br />
              The NEB operates within the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), which
              is administered by the Receiver General for Canada. All cash
              received by the NEB is deposited to the CRF and all cash
              disbursements made by the NEB are paid from the CRF. The net cash
              provided by Government is the difference between all cash receipts
              and all cash disbursements including transactions between
              departments of the Government.

            <li>
              Amounts due to or from the Consolidated Revenue Fund<br />
              <br />
              Amounts due to or from the CRF are the result of timing
              differences at year-end between when a transaction affects
              authorities and when it is processed through the CRF. Amounts due
              from the CRF represent the net amount of cash that the NEB is
              entitled to draw from the CRF without further authorities to
              discharge its liabilities. This amount is not considered to be a
              financial instrument.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The NEB has the authority to charge those companies that it
                  regulates, in accordance with sub-section&nbsp;24.1 of the NEB
                  Act, the costs attributable to the NEB’s operations in
                  carrying out its responsibilities. Under the National Energy
                  Board Cost Recovery Regulations (Regulations) approved by
                  Treasury Board, effective January&nbsp;1, 1991, the NEB
                  recovers, from the companies that it regulates, the cost of
                  its operations. Revenues from regulatory levies are recognized
                  in the accounts when they are invoiced and, in accordance with
                  the Regulations, are based on the estimated cost of operations
                  for the calendar year, with a billing adjustment to actual
                  costs once the costs are known. Actual costs are defined as
                  the sum of one-quarter of year&nbsp;1 audited fiscal costs
                  (January to March) and three-quarters of year&nbsp;2 audited
                  fiscal costs (April to December). The recoverable costs for a
                  given calendar year are allocated to the oil, gas and
                  electricity commodities proportionately on the basis of the
                  actual time spent by Board members and employees during the
                  preceding fiscal year (April&nbsp;1 to March&nbsp;31).

                  Other revenues are accounted for in the period in which the
                  underlying transaction or event occurred that gave rise to the

                  Revenues that are non-respendable are not available to
                  discharge the NEB’s liabilities. While the Chair is expected
                  to maintain accounting control, he or she has no authority
                  regarding the disposition of non-respendable revenues. As a
                  result, non-respendable revenues are considered to be earned
                  on behalf of the Government of Canada and are therefore
                  presented in reduction of the entity’s gross revenues.

                  Pension benefits: Eligible employees participate in the Public
                  Service Pension Plan (Plan), a multiemployer pension plan
                  administered by the Government of Canada. The NEB
                  contributions to the Plan are charged to expenses in the year

                  the Plan. The NEB’s responsibility with regard to the Plan is

              Accounts receivable and advances are stated at the lower of cost
              and net recoverable value. A valuation allowance is recorded for
              receivables where recovery is considered uncertain. In addition, a
              distinction is made between financial assets that are available to
              discharge the NEB’s liabilities versus the ones that are not.
              Accounts receivable that pertain to non-respendable revenues
              earned on behalf of Government are considered to be held on behalf
              of the Government of Canada and are therefore presented in the
              Statement of Financial Position as a reduction of the entity’s
              gross financial assets. Credit risk is the risk that one party to
              a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other
              party by failing to discharge an obligation. The NEB provides
              services to other government departments and agencies and to
              external parties in the normal course of business. Accounts
              receivable are due on demand. The NEB is not exposed to
              significant credit risk and has incurred very minimal credit
              losses in the past. The maximum exposure the NEB has to credit
              risk equal to the carrying value of its accounts receivables.

              <br />
              The preparation of these financial statements requires management
              to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
              of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial
              statements. At the time of preparation of these statements,
              management believes the estimates and assumptions to be
              reasonable. The most significant items where estimates are used
              are recoverable operating costs, contingent liabilities, the
              liability for employee future benefits, allowance for doubtful
              accounts and the useful life of tangible capital assets. Actual
              results could significantly differ from those estimated.
              Management's estimates are reviewed periodically and, as
              adjustments become necessary, they are recorded in the financial
              statements in the year they become known.

              Transfer of the transition payments for implementing salary
              payments in arrears<br />
              <br />
              The Government of Canada implemented salary payments in arrears in
              2014-15. As a result, a one-time payment was issued to employees
              and will be recovered from them in the future. The transition to
              salary payments in arrears forms part of the transformation
              initiative that replaces the pay system and also streamlines and
              modernizes the pay processes. This change to the pay system had no
              impact on the expenses of the NEB. However, it did result in the
              use of additional spending authorities by the NEB. The transition
              payments for implementing salary payments in arrears were
              transferred to a central account administered by Public Services
              and Procurement Canada, who is responsible for the administration
              of the Government pay system.

          <p><strong>3. Parliamentary authorities</strong></p>
          <p>
            The NEB receives most of its funding through annual parliamentary
            authorities. The majority of these expenditures are subsequently
            recovered from the companies regulated by the NEB and the funds are
            deposited in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Government of
            Canada. Items recognized in the Statement of Operations and Net
            Financial Position and the Statement of Financial Position in one
            year may be funded through Parliamentary authorities in prior,
            current or future years. Accordingly, the NEB has different net
            results of operations for the year on a government funding basis
            than on an accrual accounting basis. The differences are reconciled
            in the following tables:

              <strong>Pension benefits:</strong><br />
              <br />
              The NEB employees participate in the public service pension plan
              (the “Plan”), which is sponsored and administered by the
              Government of Canada. Pension benefits accrue up to a maximum
              period of 35&nbsp;years at a rate of 2&nbsp;percent per year of
              pensionable service, times the average of the best five
              consecutive years of earnings. The benefits are integrated with
              Canada/Québec Pension Plan benefits and they are indexed to
              inflation.<br />
              <br />
              Both the employees and the NEB contribute to the cost of the Plan.
              Due to the amendment of the Public Service Superannuation Act
              following the implementation of provisions related to Economic
              Action Plan 2012, employee contributors have been divided into two
              groups. Group&nbsp;1 relates to existing plan members as of
              December&nbsp;31, 2012 and Group&nbsp;2 relates to members joining
              the Plan as of January&nbsp;1, 2013. Each group has a distinct
              contribution rate.<br />
              <br />
              The 2016-2017 expense amounts to $5,996,615 ($5,943,643 in
              2015-2016). For Group&nbsp;1 members, the expense represents
              approximately 1.12&nbsp;times (1.25&nbsp;times in 2015-2016) the
              employee contributions and, for Group&nbsp;2 members,
              approximately 1.08 times (1.24&nbsp;times in 2015-2016) the
              employee contributions.<br />
              <br />
              The NEB’s responsibility with regard to the Plan is limited to its
              contributions. Actuarial surpluses or deficiencies are recognized
              in the Financial Statements of the Government of Canada, as the
              Plan's sponsor.

              <strong>Severance benefits:</strong><br />
              <br />
              The NEB provides severance benefits to its employees based on
              eligibility, years of service and salary at termination of
              employment. These severance benefits are not pre-funded and
              benefits will be paid from future authorities.<br />
              <br />
              As part of collective agreement negotiations with represented
              employees, and changes to conditions of employment for executives
              and certain non-represented employees, the accumulation of
              severance benefits under the employee severance pay program ceased
              for these employees commencing in 2012. Employees subject to these
              changes have been given the option to be immediately paid the full
              or partial value of benefits earned to date or to collect the full
              or remaining value of benefits on termination from the public
              service. These changes have been reflected in the calculation of
              the outstanding severance benefit obligation and reflect
              management’s best estimate of these future events.<br />
              <br />
              Details of the severance benefits, measured as at March&nbsp;31,
              are as follows:<br />

                <strong>b) Claims and litigation</strong><br />
                <br />
                Claims have been made against the NEB in the normal course of
                operations. These claims include items with pleading amounts and
                other for which no amount is specified. While the total amount
                claimed in these actions is significant the outcomes are not
                determinable. NEB is one of a number of parties to these claims,
                and due to the broad and non-detailed ranges of the damages
                claimed, the extent of the potential liability cannot be
                reasonably measured.<br />
                <br />
                The NEB will record an allowance for claims and litigations
                where it is likely that there will be a future payment and a
                reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. For all other
                claims and litigations where the outcome is not determinable, no
                reasonable estimate can be made by management.

            The NEB is related as a result of common ownership to all government
            departments, agencies, and Crown Corporations. The NEB enters into
            transactions with these entities in the normal course of business
            and on normal trade terms. During the year, the NEB received
            services which were obtained without charge from other government
            departments as discussed below.

                The Government has centralized some of its administrative
                activities for efficiency, cost-effectiveness purposes and
                economic delivery of programs to the public. As a result, the
                Government uses central agencies and common service
                organizations so that one department performs services for all
                other departments and agencies without charge.<br />
                <br />
                Based on an agreement between the NEB and Public Services and
                Procurement Canada (PSPC), PSPC incurred fit up costs for new
                office space related to the NEB office move which took place in
                2014-15. PSPC incurred no leasehold improvements in 2015-16.
                These services provided without charge have been recorded in
                NEB’s Statement of Financial Position.<br />

            In accordance with the Cost Recovery Regulations recoverable
            operating costs are based on the expenditures for the calendar year.
            A calendar year is the period from January&nbsp;1 to
            Decembery&nbsp;31. The operating costs for Calendar 2016 are from
            Schedule&nbsp;A of the fiscal year 2016-2017 financial statements.
            The current year recoverable expenses are calculated using one
            quarter of recoverable expenses from the prior fiscal year and three
            quarters of recoverable expenses from the current fiscal year. The
            methodology used by management to determine actual costs is reviewed
            on a periodic basis and adjusted for significant events.

            Annex to the Statement of Management Responsibility Including
            Internal Control over Financial Reporting of National Energy Board
            for Fiscal Year 2016-2017 (unaudited)
          </h2>
          <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>
            In support of an effective system of internal control, the National
            Energy Board (NEB) annually assesses the performance of its
            financial controls to ensure that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Financial arrangements or contracts are entered into only when
              sufficient funding is available;
            </li>
            <li>
              Payments for goods and services are made only when the goods or
              services are received or the conditions of contracts or other
              arrangements have been satisfied; and
            </li>
            <li>Payments have been properly authorized.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB will leverage the results of the periodic core control
            audits performed by the Office of the Comptroller General. Below is
            a summary of the results of the assessment conducted during fiscal
            year 2016-17.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Assessment results during fiscal year 2016-17</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            For the most part, controls related to payment for goods and
            services and payment authority were functioning well and form an
            adequate basis for the department’s system of internal control.
          </p>
          <p><strong>3. Assessment plan</strong></p>
          <p>
            The NEB will continue to monitor the performance of its system of
            internal control, with a focus on the core controls related to
            financial transactions.

                <p>
                  I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the
                  National Energy Board, which comprise the statement of
                  financial position as at 31&nbsp;December&nbsp;2010, and the
                  statement of operations and equity of Canada and statement of
                  cash flow for the year then ended, and a summary of
                  significant accounting policies and other explanatory
                  information.

                <p>
                  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair
                  presentation of these financial statements in accordance with
                  Canadian public sector accounting standards, and for such
                  internal control as management determines is necessary to
                  enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
                  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

                <p><em>Auditor's Responsibility</em></p>
                <p>
                  My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
                  statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in
                  accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing
                  standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical
                  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
                  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements

                  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
                  evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
                  statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
                  judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
                  misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud
                  or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor

                  entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial
                  statements in order to design audit procedures that are
                  appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
                  expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
                  internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
                  appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
                  reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as
                  well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial

                  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is

                  In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
                  material respects, the financial position of the National
                  Energy Board as at 31&nbsp;December&nbsp;2010, and the results
                  of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended
                  in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting
                  standards.

            <strong>Management's Responsibility for Financial Reporting</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the accompanying
            financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2010
            and all information contained in these statements rests with
            National Energy Board's (the Board) management. The financial
            statements have been prepared in accordance with Treasury Board
            accounting policies which are based on Canadian generally accepted
            accounting principles for the public sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the
            information in these financial statements. Some of the information
            in the financial statements is based on management's best estimates
            and judgment and gives due consideration to materiality. To fulfil
            its accounting and reporting responsibilities, management maintains
            a set of accounts that provides a centralized record of the Board's
            financial transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management maintains a system of financial management and internal
            control designed to provide reasonable assurance that financial
            information is reliable, that assets are safeguarded and that
            transactions are in accordance with the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, are executed in accordance
            with prescribed regulations, within Parliamentary authorities, and
            are properly recorded to maintain accountability of Government
            funds. Management also seeks to ensure the objectivity and integrity
            of data in its financial statements by careful selection, training
            and development of qualified staff, by organizational arrangements
            that provide appropriate divisions of responsibility, and by
            communication programs aimed at ensuring that regulations, policies,
            standards and managerial authorities are understood throughout the
            Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to fulfil its accounting and reporting responsibilities on
            cost recovery, management also maintains a weekly time reporting
            system that records the efforts of all staff among the regulated
            commodities. In accordance with the
            <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em>, the
            Board's costs are allocated to the commodities on the basis of the
            preceding fiscal year's accumulated time. The Board is responsible
            for the accuracy of billings to companies within the commodity
            groups.

            The Auditor General of Canada, the independent auditor for the
            Government of Canada, annually provides an objective opinion on the

              Notes to the Financial Statements For<br />

          <p><strong>1. Authority, Objectives and Operations</strong></p>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is an independent
            federal agency established in&nbsp;1959 to promote safety and
            security, environmental protection and economic efficiency in the
            Canadian public interest within the mandate set by Parliament for
            the regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade.
            The&nbsp;Board reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural
            Resources. The NEB was established under the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and is designated as a
            department and named under Schedule&nbsp;I.1 of the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board's main responsibilities include regulating the
            construction and operation of interprovincial and international oil
            and gas pipelines, international power lines, and designated
            interprovincial power lines. Furthermore, the Board regulates the
            tolls and tariffs for the pipelines under its jurisdiction. With
            respect to the specific energy commodities, the Board regulates the
            export of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids and electricity, and
            the import of natural gas. Additionally, the Board regulates oil and
            gas exploration and development on Frontier Lands and offshore areas
            not covered by provincial or federal management agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB is an independent regulatory tribunal guided by the
            principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. The Board is
            a court of record and has certain powers of a superior court of
            record including those for the attendance, swearing and examination
            of witnesses; the production and inspection of documents; the
            enforcement of its orders; and the inspection of property. Aside
            from rare exceptions provided for in law, the Board's regulatory
            decisions and the accompanying Reasons for Decision are issued as
            public documents.

              >2. Significant Accounting Policies and Provisions of the
              Regulations</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
            Treasury Board accounting policies which are based on Canadian
            generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the public
            sector. The presentation and results using the stated accounting
            policies do not result in any significant differences from GAAP,
            except as disclosed in Note&nbsp;13 -&nbsp;Net Financial Assets
            Indicator.
          </p>
          <p>
            The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
            estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the
            financial statements and accompanying notes. At the time of
            preparation of these statements, management believes the estimates
            and assumptions to be reasonable. Actual results could differ
            significantly from these estimates. The more significant estimates
            include the provision for employee severance benefits, accounts
            payable and accrued liabilities, the determination of the allowance
            for doubtful accounts, and the determination of the cost of services
            received without charge from other government departments.

            <li>
              Parliamentary appropriations<br />
              The NEB is financed by the Government of Canada (Government)
              through Parliamentary appropriations. Appropriations provided to
              the NEB do not parallel financial reporting according to GAAP
              since appropriations are primarily based on cash flow
              requirements. Consequently, items recognized in the statement of
              operations and the statement of cash flow are not necessarily the
              same as those provided through appropriations from Parliament.
              Note&nbsp;3 provides a high-level reconciliation between the
              different bases of reporting.<br />

            <li>
              Net cash remitted to or provided by Government<br />
              The NEB operates within the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), which
              is administered by the Receiver General for Canada. All cash
              received by the NEB is deposited to the CRF and all cash
              disbursements made by the NEB are paid from the CRF. The net cash
              (remitted to) provided by Government is the difference between all
              cash receipts and all cash disbursements including transactions
              between departments of the federal government.<br />

              Change in net position in the Consolidated Revenue Fund<br />
              The change in net position in the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF)
              is the difference between the net cash provided by Government and
              appropriations used in a year, excluding the amount of non
              respendable revenue recorded by the department. It results from
              timing differences between when a transaction affects
              appropriations and when it is processed through the CRF.<br />

                  Regulatory authority<br />
                  The NEB has the authority to charge those companies it
                  regulates, in accordance with sub-section&nbsp;24.1(1) of the
                  NEB Act, the total costs attributable to the NEB's operations
                  in carrying out its related responsibilities.<br />

                  Under the
                  <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em>
                  (Regulations) approved by Treasury Board, the NEB recovers,
                  from the companies it regulates, the cost of its operations,
                  effective January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1991. The Board also has the
                  delegated authority to determine what costs will be excluded
                  from program expenditures for cost recovery purposes.<br />

                  Non-recoverable costs<br />
                  The NEB approved the exclusion of costs related to the
                  regulation of exploration for and development of oil and gas
                  on the Frontier Lands, and therefore, these costs are
                  non-recoverable. These costs are excluded when calculating the
                  levies to be charged to companies, but are recognized as
                  expenses in the Statement of Operations and thus in the
                  determination of the Equity of Canada account.<br />

                  In accordance with Sections&nbsp;12 and&nbsp;13 of the
                  Regulations, the recoverable costs for a given calendar year
                  are allocated to the oil, gas and electricity commodities
                  proportionately on the basis of the actual time spent by Board
                  members and employees during the preceding fiscal year
                  (April&nbsp;1 to March&nbsp;31).<br />

              Expenses<br />
              Expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Vacation pay and
              compensatory leave are expensed as the benefits accrue to
              employees under their respective terms of employment.<br />

                  Pension benefits<br />
                  All eligible employees participate in the Public Service
                  Pension Plan (Plan) administered by the Government of Canada.
                  The NEB's contributions reflect the full cost as an employer.
                  This amount is currently based on a multiple of an employee's
                  required contributions and may change over time depending on
                  the experience of the Plan. The NEB's contributions are
                  expensed during the year in which the services are rendered
                  and represent the total pension obligation of the Board. The
                  NEB is not currently required to make contributions with
                  respect to any actuarial deficiencies of the Public Service
                  Pension Plan.<br />

                  Employee severance benefits<br />
                  Employees are entitled to severance benefits, as provided for
                  under labour contracts and conditions of employment. The cost
                  of these benefits is accrued as the employees render the
                  services necessary to earn them. The cost of the benefits
                  earned by employees is calculated using information derived
                  from the results of the actuarially determined liability for
                  employee severance benefits for the Government as a whole.<br />

              for accommodation, the employer's contributions to the health and
              dental insurance plans, banking, legal and audit services are
              recorded as operating expenses based on their estimated costs.
              Amounts for services received without charge from other government

          <p>
            The Government of Canada funds the expenses of the NEB through
            annual Parliamentary appropriations. The majority of these
            expenditures are subsequently recovered from the companies regulated
            by the NEB and the funds are deposited in the Consolidated Revenue
            Fund of the Government of Canada.

            Items recognized in the statement of operations and the statement of

            appropriations in prior, current or future years. The differences

            The NEB is a party to and shares in the costs incurred by the
            Northern Gas Project Secretariat (NGPS). The NEB also administers
            the Environmental Studies Research Funds (ESRF). NGPS expenses are
            part of the NEB's appropriation whereas ESRF expenses are not.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NGPS was established in&nbsp;2002, under the Cooperation Plan,
            to assist in the environmental assessment and regulatory review of
            the proposed Mackenzie Gas Project. NGPS staff supported the
            environmental and regulatory agencies that were reviewing the
            proposed Mackenzie Gas Project, particularly those agencies that
            held public hearings as part of their review. The regulatory process
            commenced in October&nbsp;2004 with the filing of five applications
            for the construction and operation of the Mackenzie Gas Project and
            the Joint Review Panel subsequently released its report in
            December&nbsp;2009.

          <p>
            According to the Treasury Board submission approved on
            December&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2003, the operating costs of NGPS incurred by
            NEB are recoverable under the NEB Act since the Secretariat
            functions are classified as part of the application process of the
            NEB Act. During&nbsp;2010 and&nbsp;2009, there were no costs
            incurred related to NGPS. The administration of the NGPS by the NEB
            ended on March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2010.

            ESRF funds are provided by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC)

            unused balances in the ESRF accounts are transferred back to the
            partner departments at year-end. ESRF expenses are reflected in the
            financial statements of INAC and NRCan and are excluded from the
            NEB's financial statements. The administration of ESRF by the NEB
            ended on March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2010.

            adjustment of $5,194,000 for the current year and $8,139,000 for the
            prior year will be applied to the provisional billings of&nbsp;2012
            and&nbsp;2011 respectively. The portion of the 2008 billing
            adjustment of $6,649,000 that relates to the oil and gas commodity
            pipelines amounts to $5,792,000 and has been applied to the 2010
            provisional billings. The remaining $857,000 relates to the
            electricity commodity and will be invoiced to electricity exporters
            to finalize their accounts. Effective January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2010,
            amendments to the
            <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em> took effect
            resulting in a change in the obligation for cost recovery from
            electricity exporters to international and inter-provincial power
            lines. The billing adjustments for&nbsp;2008 (electricity commodity
            only), 2009 and&nbsp;2010 are included in accounts receivable as at
            December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2010.

          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li>
              <strong>Pension benefits</strong><br />
              The NEB's employees participate in the Public Service Pension Plan
              which is sponsored and administered by the Government of Canada.
              Pension benefits accrue up to a maximum period of 35&nbsp;years at
              a rate of 2&nbsp;percent per year of pensionable service, times
              the average of the best five consecutive years of earnings. The
              benefits are integrated with Canada/Quebec Pension Plans benefits
              and they are indexed to inflation.<br />
              <br />
              Both the employees and the NEB contribute to the cost of the Plan.
              The 2010 expense amounts to $5,041,000 (2009 - $3,788,000), which
              represents approximately 2.0&nbsp;times (2009 - 1.7&nbsp;times)
              the contributions by employees, which amounts to $2,494,000 (2009
              - $2,278,000).<br />
              <br />
              The NEB's responsibility with regards to the Plan is limited to
              its contributions. Actuarial surpluses or deficiencies are
              recognized in the financial statements of the Government of
              Canada, as the Plan's sponsor.<br />

            <li>
              <strong>Employee severance benefits</strong><br />
              The NEB provides severance benefits to its employees based on
              their eligibility, years of service and final salary. These
              severance benefits are not pre-funded. Benefits will be paid from
              future appropriations. Information about the severance benefits,
              measured as at the balance sheet date, is as follows:

          <p>
            The carrying amounts of the Board's financial instruments, including
            accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
            approximate the fair value because of the short term to maturity.
            There is no concentration of accounts receivable, and, therefore,
            there is no significant credit risk.

            into transactions with these entities in the normal course of
            business and on normal trade terms. The Board also receives the
            following services without charge from other government departments

              <strong>Claims and litigation</strong><br />
              Claims have been made against the NEB in the normal course of
              operations. Legal proceedings for claims totaling approximately
              $826,000 (2009 - $846,000) were still pending at
              December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2010. Some of these potential liabilities
              may become actual liabilities when one or more future events occur
              or fail to occur. To the extent that the future event is likely to
              occur or fail to occur, and a reasonable estimate of the loss can
              be made, an estimated liability is accrued and an expense recorded
              in the financial statements. While the final outcome with respect
              to claims and legal proceedings pending at
              December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2010 cannot be predicted with certainty, it
              is the opinion of management that their resolution will not have a
              material adverse effect on NEB's financial position or results of
              operations.

          <p><strong>13. Net Financial Assets Indicator</strong></p>
          <p>
            The presentation of the net financial assets indicator and a
            statement of change in net financial assets is required under GAAP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Net financial assets is the difference between a government
            organization's financial assets and its financial liabilities. A
            statement of change in net financial assets would show changes
            during the period in components such as tangible capital assets,
            prepaid expenses and inventories. The NEB is financed by the
            Government of Canada through appropriations and operates within the
            Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), which is administered by the
            Receiver General for Canada. All cash received by the NEB is
            deposited to the CRF and all cash disbursements made by the NEB are
            paid by the CRF. Under this government business model, assets
            reflected on the NEB's financial statements are not available to use
            for the purpose of discharging the existing liabilities of the NEB.
            Future appropriations would be used to discharge existing
            liabilities.

<td rowspan="4">The National Energy Board should systematically track compliance with pipeline approval conditions and adequately document this oversight work. This documentation should include for example, notifying companies on the status of achievement of the condition.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Board&rsquo;s response.</strong> Agreed. While the National Energy Board monitors companies&rsquo; compliance with pipeline approval conditions throughout all phases of the pipeline life cycle, the Board is committed to documenting its oversight work in a more rigorous manner.<br>
<br>
By December&nbsp;2016, the Board will clarify and enhance its processes so&nbsp;that company compliance with pipeline approval conditions is tracked and documented more systematically. Also, staff will be trained on the updated processes by this date.<br>
<br>
The Board assesses all filings that are made by companies in accordance with pipeline approval conditions. The Board formally notifies companies when they have satisfied a condition that requires&nbsp;Board approval. By December&nbsp;2016, the Board will complete the analysis to determine whether formal notification to companies concerning the status of achievement of other types of conditions is appropriate, and, if so, the timing and manner of&nbsp;such notification. The analysis will take into account the fact that some pipeline approval conditions apply in an ongoing manner over part or all of a&nbsp;pipeline&rsquo;s life cycle.</td>

<td rowspan="4">The National Energy Board should systematically verify that companies implement corrective actions to non-compliance situations within the required timeline. This includes notifying companies when the corrective action is satisfactory. The Board should integrate this work with needed improvements into information management systems.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Board&rsquo;s response.</strong> Agreed. The National Energy Board follows up on&nbsp;all identified non-compliances and tracks corrective actions taken to address non-compliances. The Board has already taken significant steps to&nbsp;enable the more systematic verification of corrective action implementation and is committed to continuing this work.<br>
<br>
By June&nbsp;2016, the Board will further clarify and enhance its processes applicable to corrective action follow-up, in a manner that builds upon the work the Board has already completed. The Board will also, by June&nbsp;2016, clarify the consequences for companies that do not undertake corrective actions within the Board&rsquo;s required timeline.<br>
<br>
The Board communicates its expectations and requirements related to correcting non-compliances to companies in various ways, including through Board and Inspection Officer Orders. By June&nbsp;2016, the Board will enhance its processes and tools so that, when appropriate, it consistently notifies companies when their corrective actions have met the Board&rsquo;s requirements. Staff will be trained on updated processes.</td>

<td rowspan="3">The National Energy Board should assess and address its information and data management needs. In doing so, the Board should ensure that its information and data management requirements are aligned with the needs of its critical business processes.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Board&rsquo;s response.</strong> Agreed. In&nbsp;2015, the National Energy Board took important steps to modernize its systems for certain critical business processes, including the creation of its online Event Reporting System and&nbsp;electronic Operations Regulatory Compliance Application (ORCA). Through the development of these systems, the Board clarified its data and information needs with respect to incident reporting and inspections.<br>
<br>
The Board will continue to build on its improvement efforts in the area&nbsp;of data management. In the&nbsp;2016&ndash;17&nbsp;fiscal year, the Board will implement the next series of steps to assess and address its information and data management needs. A&nbsp;more comprehensive, integrated system will better support information and data management needs for the Board&rsquo;s critical business processes, such as inspection, audit, and enforcement.</td>

<strong>The Board&rsquo;s response.</strong> Agreed. The National Energy Board currently publishes key compliance and enforcement information on its website, with the goal of providing all relevant information related to&nbsp;its compliance and enforcement in a manner that is clear and accessible. The Board&rsquo;s website also contains some information about company compliance with pipeline approval conditions and this information will be enhanced. By December&nbsp;2016, the Board will begin to implement its plan to facilitate enhanced access by members of the public to information regarding the status of pipeline approval conditions.

<td rowspan="2">In preparation for its new responsibilities under the Pipeline Safety Act (coming into force by June 2016), the National Energy Board, in consultation with Natural Resources Canada, should consolidate the risks identified through its various risk assessment activities into an all hazards risk assessment to inform its emergency management plan.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Board&rsquo;s response.</strong> Agreed. Risk assessment is an integral part of the Board&rsquo;s decision making and emergency management. The Board conducts a variety of risk assessment activities and is fully prepared to respond in the event of a pipeline emergency. The Board continues to assess risk in the context of its regulatory oversight role and within an integrated, whole-of-government approach.<br>
<br>
Emergency management is a priority for the Board and, to be effective, it&nbsp;requires coordination between a variety of partners. The Board has proactively identified and implemented specific measures to improve not only in the areas for which it is accountable, but to exercise leadership to bring together all relevant stakeholders.<br>
<br>
The Board welcomes the Pipeline Safety Act as it will strengthen our legislation and expand our toolkit to protect Canadians and the environment.<br>
<br>
In the interest of continued improvement, the Board appreciates the&nbsp;recommendation. In connection with its other key emergency management initiatives already under way, the Board will, by June&nbsp;2016, consolidate its various risk assessment activities related to its mandate into a central document and, in doing so, will consult with Natural Resources Canada as appropriate. This consolidation will explain how the Board&rsquo;s risk assessment activities are integrated with other key Board emergency preparedness measures, such as its emergency response procedures.</td>

<td rowspan="5">The National Energy Board should review its overall resource assessment and, in consultation with other relevant federal authorities where appropriate, should further explore avenues to address and resolve its challenges in the recruitment and retention of key staff.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Board&rsquo;s response.</strong> Agreed. The National Energy Board is committed to attracting, retaining, and developing highly qualified staff, and has done so through the implementation of a variety of strategies and measures that have worked to mitigate the risks associated with recruitment and retention of staff.<br>
<br>
While challenges exist, they are not unique to the Board and are faced by&nbsp;other Canadian employers, including in the oil and gas industry. The&nbsp;Board will continue to seek constructive and flexible solutions to attract and retain highly skilled individuals and, in doing so, will consult with other relevant federal authorities where appropriate.<br>

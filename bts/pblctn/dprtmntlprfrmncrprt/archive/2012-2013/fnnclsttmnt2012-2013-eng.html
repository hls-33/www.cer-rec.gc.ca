          <p>
            Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the accompanying
            financial statements for the year ended March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2013 and
            all information contained in these statements rests with the
            management of the National Energy Board (NEB). These financial
            statements have been prepared by management using the Government’s
            accounting policies, which are based on Canadian public sector
            accounting standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the
            information in these financial statements. Some of the information
            in the financial statements is based on management's best estimates
            and judgment and gives due consideration to materiality. To fulfil
            its accounting and reporting responsibilities, management maintains
            a set of accounts that provides a centralized record of the NEB’s
            financial transactions. Financial information submitted in the
            preparation of the Public Accounts of Canada, and included in the
            NEB’s <em>Departmental Performance Report</em> is consistent with
            these financial statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management is also responsible for maintaining an effective system
            of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) designed to
            provide reasonable assurance that financial information is reliable,
            that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly
            authorized and recorded in accordance with the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and other applicable
            legislation, regulations, authorities and policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management seeks to ensure the objectivity and integrity of data in
            its financial statements through careful selection, training, and
            development of qualified staff; through organizational arrangements
            that provide appropriate divisions of responsibility; through
            communication programs aimed at ensuring that regulations, policies,
            standards, and managerial authorities are understood throughout the
            NEB and through conducting an annual risk-based assessment of the
            effectiveness of the system of ICFR.

            The system of ICFR is designed to mitigate risks to a reasonable
            level based on an on-going process to identify key risks, to assess
            effectiveness of associated key controls, and to make any necessary
            adjustments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB will be subject to periodic Core Control Audits performed by
            the Office of the Comptroller General and will use the results of
            such audits to adhere to the Treasury Board
            <em>Policy on Internal Control</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the interim, the NEB has undertaken a risk-based assessment of
            the system of ICFR for the year ended March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2013, in
            accordance with the Treasury Board
            <em>Policy on Internal Control</em>, and the results and action plan
            is summarized in the <a href="#nnx">annex</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The financial statements of the NEB have not been audited for the
            March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2013 fiscal year. However, the National Energy
            Board also produces financial statements on a calendar year basis in
            accordance with the
            <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em>. The Office
            of the Auditor General of Canada, the independent auditor for the
            Government of Canada, has expressed an opinion on the fair
            presentation of the 2012&nbsp;financial statements of the NEB which
            does not include an audit opinion on the annual assessment of the
            effectiveness of the department’s internal controls over financial
            reporting.

          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is an independent
            federal regulator established in 1959 to promote safety and
            security, environmental protection and economic efficiency in the
            Canadian public interest for the regulation of pipelines, energy
            development and trade. The Board reports to Parliament through the
            Minister of Natural Resources. The NEB was established under the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and is designated as a
            department and named under Schedule&nbsp;I.1 of the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board's responsibilities can be framed into the following
            program activity architecture which is also the basis for its
            segmented Statement of Operations:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-upr-rmn ">
            <li>
              Energy Regulation<br />
              The Board’s responsibilities include regulating the construction
              and operation of interprovincial and international oil and gas
              pipelines, international power lines, and designated
              interprovincial power lines. The Board also regulates the tolls
              and tariffs of the pipelines under its jurisdiction as well as the
              export of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids and electricity,
              and the import of natural gas. Additionally, the Board regulates
              oil and gas exploration and development on frontier lands and
              offshore areas not covered by provincial or federal management
              agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Energy Information<br />
              The Board monitors aspects of energy supply, demand, production,
              development and trade of all energy commodities that fall within
              the jurisdiction of the federal government. The Board publishes
              periodic assessments of Canadian supply and demand of energy and
              natural gas markets to inform Canadians on trends, events and
              issues which may affect Canadian energy markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Internal Services<br />
              The Board ensures that it has the capacity to deliver on its
              mandate by its commitment to enhancing its organizational
              performance by developing, nurturing and maintaining expertise in
              its people strategy.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB is an independent, federal, quasi-judicial regulatory
            tribunal guided by the principles of natural justice and procedural
            fairness. The Board is a court of record and has certain powers of a
            superior court with respect to the attendance, swearing and
            examination of witnesses; the production and inspection of
            documents; the enforcement of its orders; the entry on and
            inspection of property; and other matters necessary or proper for
            the due exercise of its jurisdiction. Aside from rare exceptions,
            the Board's regulatory decisions and the accompanying Reasons for
            Decision are issued as public documents.

            <strong>2. Summary of significant accounting policies</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The financial statements have been prepared using the Government’s
            accounting policies stated below, which are based on Canadian public
            sector accounting standards. The presentation and results using the
            stated accounting policies do not result in any significant
            differences from Canadian public sector accounting standards.
          </p>
          <p>Significant accounting policies are as follows:</p>
          <ul class="lst-lwr-alph " id="s2a">
            <li>
              Parliamentary authorities - The NEB is financed by the Government
              of Canada through Parliamentary authorities. Financial reporting
              of authorities provided to the NEB do not parallel financial
              reporting according to generally accepted accounting principles
              since authorities are primarily based on cash flow requirements.
              Consequently, items recognized in the Statement of Operations and
              Departmental Net Financial Position and the Statement of Financial
              Position are not necessarily the same as those provided through
              authorities from Parliament.
              <a href="#s3">Note&nbsp;3</a> provides a high-level reconciliation
              between the bases of reporting. The planned results amounts in the
              Statement of Operations, the Departmental Net Financial Position
              and the Statement of Change in Departmental Net Debt are the
              amounts reported in the future-oriented financial statements
              included in the 2012-2013 <em>Report on Plans and Priorities</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Net cash provided by (to) Government - The NEB operates within the
              Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), which is administered by the
              Receiver General for Canada. All cash received by the department
              is deposited to the CRF and all cash disbursements made by the
              department are paid from the CRF. The net cash provided by (to)
              Government is the difference between all cash receipts and all
              cash disbursements including transactions between departments of
              the federal government.
            </li>
            <li>
              Amounts due from/to the CRF are the result of timing differences
              at year-end between when a transaction affects authorities and
              when it is processed through the CRF. Amounts due from the CRF
              represent the net amount of cash that the Department is entitled
              to draw from the CRF without further authorities to discharge its
              liabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revenues:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Revenues from regulatory levies are recognized in the accounts
                  when they are invoiced and, in accordance with the
                  <em>National Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations</em>, are
                  based on the estimated cost of operations for the calendar
                  year, with a billing adjustment to actual costs once the costs
                  are known.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Other revenues are accounted for in the period in which the
                  underlying transaction or event occurred that gave rise to the
                  revenues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Funds that have been received are recorded as deferred
                  revenue, provided the Department has an obligation to other
                  parties for the provision of goods, services or use of assets
                  in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Revenues that are non-respendable are not available to
                  discharge the NEB’s liabilities. While the Chair is expected
                  to maintain accounting control, he or she has no authority
                  regarding the disposition of non-respendable revenues. As a
                  result, non-respendable revenues are considered to be earned
                  on behalf of the Government of Canada and are therefore
                  presented in reduction of the entity’s gross revenues.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Expenses - Expenses are recorded on the accrual basis:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Vacation pay and compensatory leave are expensed as the
                  benefits accrue to employees under their respective terms of
                  employment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Services provided without charge by other government
                  departments for accommodation, the employer's contribution to
                  the health and dental insurance plans, and legal services are
                  recorded as operating expenses at their estimated cost.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Expenditures of the Board that are excluded from Cost Recovery
                  Regulations are those expenditures related to the regulation
                  of, exploration for, and the development of oil and gas on
                  frontier lands. These amounts are included in Expenses in the
                  Statement of Operations and Net Departmental Financial
                  Position.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Pension benefits: Eligible employees participate in the Public
                  Service Pension Plan, a multiemployer plan administered by the
                  Government of Canada. The NEB contributions to the Plan are
                  charged to expenses in the year incurred and represent the
                  total departmental obligation to the Plan. The NEB’s
                  responsibility with regard to the Plan is limited to its
                  contributions. Actuarial surpluses or deficiencies are
                  recognized in the financial statements of the Government of
                  Canada, as the Plan’s sponsor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Severance benefits: Employees entitled to severance benefits
                  under labour contracts or conditions of employment earn these
                  benefits as services necessary to earn them are rendered. The
                  obligation relating to the benefits earned by employees is
                  calculated using information derived from the results of the
                  actuarially determined liability for employee severance
                  benefits for the Government as a whole.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Accounts receivables are stated at the lower of cost and net
              recoverable value. A valuation allowance is recorded for
              receivables where recovery is considered uncertain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contingent liabilities - Contingent liabilities are potential
              liabilities which may become actual liabilities when one or more
              future events occur or fail to occur. To the extent that the
              future event is likely to occur or fail to occur, and a reasonable
              estimate of the loss can be made, an estimated liability is
              accrued and an expense recorded. If the likelihood is not
              determinable or an amount cannot be reasonably estimated, the
              contingency is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tangible capital assets - All tangible capital assets and
              leasehold improvements having an initial cost of $10,000 or more
              or significant bulk purchases over $10,000 where each item may be
              less than $10,000, are recorded at their acquisition cost. The
              department does not capitalize intangibles, works of art and
              historical treasures that have cultural, aesthetic or historical
              value, assets located on Indian Reserves and museum
              collections.<br />
              <br />
              Amortization of tangible capital assets is done on a straight-line
              basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:

              preparation of these statements, management believes the estimates
              and assumptions to be reasonable. The most significant items where
              estimates are used are contingent liabilities, the liability for
              employee future benefits, allowance for doubtful accounts and the
              useful life of tangible capital assets. Actual results could
              significantly differ from those estimated. Management's estimates
              are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary,
              they are recorded in the financial statements in the year they
              become known.

          <p>
            The NEB receives most of its funding through annual Parliamentary
            authorities. The majority of these expenditures are subsequently
            recovered from the companies regulated by the NEB and the funds are
            deposited in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Government of
            Canada. Items recognized in the Statement of Operations and Net
            Financial Position and the Statement of Financial Position in one
            year may be funded through Parliamentary authorities in prior,
            current or future years. Accordingly, the NEB has different net
            results of operations for the year on a government funding basis
            than on an accrual accounting basis. The differences are reconciled
            in the following tables:

              The NEB's employees participate in the Public Service Pension
              Plan, which is sponsored and administered by the Government.
              Pension benefits accrue up to a maximum period of 35&nbsp;years at
              a rate of 2&nbsp;percent per year of pensionable service, times
              the average of the best five consecutive years of earnings. The
              benefits are integrated with Canada/Québec Pension Plans benefits
              and they are indexed to inflation.<br />
              <br />
              Both the employees and the NEB contribute to the cost of the Plan.
              The 2012-13&nbsp;expense amounts to $5,382,478 ($5,231,624
              in&nbsp;2011-12), which represents approximately 1.7&nbsp;times
              (1.8 in&nbsp;2011-12) the contributions by employees.<br />
              <br />
              The NEB's responsibility with regard to the Plan is limited to its
              contributions. Actuarial surpluses or deficiencies are recognized
              in the financial statements of the Government of Canada, as the

              <br />
              Claims have been made against the NEB in the normal course of
              operations. These claims include items with pleading amounts and
              other for which no amount is specified. Based on the NEB's
              assessment, legal proceedings for claims estimated at $4,230,000
              were pending at March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2013. Some of these potential
              liabilities may become actual liabilities when one or more future
              events occur or fail to occur. To the extent that the future event
              is likely to occur or fail to occur, and a reasonable estimate of
              the loss can be made, an estimated liability is accrued and an
              expense recorded in the financial statements.

                The Government has centralized some of its administrative
                activities for efficiency, cost-effectiveness purposes and
                economic delivery of programs to the public. As a result, the
                Government uses central agencies and common service
                organizations so that one department performs services for all
                other departments and agencies without charge. The costs of
                these services, such as the payroll and cheque issuance services
                provided by Public Works and Government Services Canada and
                audit services provided by the Office of the Auditor General are
                not included in the NEB's Statement of Operations and Net

          <p><strong> 1. Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>
            In support of an effective system of internal control, the National
            Energy Board (NEB) will annually assess the performance of its
            financial controls to ensure that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Financial arrangements or contracts are entered into only when
              sufficient funding is available;
            </li>
            <li>
              Payments for goods and services are made only when the goods or
              services are received or the conditions of contracts or other
              arrangements have been satisfied; and
            </li>
            <li>Payments have been properly authorized.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB will leverage the results of the periodic core control
            audits performed by the Office of the Comptroller General. Below is
            a summary of the results of the assessment conducted during fiscal
            year&nbsp;2012-13.

            >2. Assessment results during fiscal year&nbsp;2012-13
          </strong>
          <p>
            For the most part, controls related to payment for goods and
            services and payment authority are in place and form an adequate
            system of internal control. During&nbsp;2012-2013, the following
            adjustments were made to strengthen control in a number of key
            areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Amendments made to segregation of duties between payment
              authorization and contract initiation/approval;
            </li>
            <li>
              Increased availability of training for budget managers in s.32 and
              s.34 of the FAA and delegation matrix;
            </li>
            <li>
              Completed centralization of voucher entry in accounts payable;
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented annual internal audit of specimen signature cards;
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhanced budget and forecast processes, including variance
              reporting;
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduced formal process for review and approval of results by
              CEO related to budget and forecast processes;
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved controls to limit and ensure proper justification of sole
              source and repeat contracts;
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduced additional oversight on timing of expenditures to
              mitigate risks associated with disproportionate spending occurring
              late in the fiscal year; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Reviewed and restricted number of individuals allowed to exercise
              s.32 and s.34 authority.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>3. Assessment plan</strong></p>
          <p>
            Assessment plan The NEB will continue to monitor the performance of
            its system of internal control, with a focus on the core controls
            related to financial transactions.

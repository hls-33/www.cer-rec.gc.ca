          <p>
            Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the accompanying
            financial statements for the year ended March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2014 and
            all information contained in these statements rests with the
            management of the National Energy Board (NEB). These financial
            statements have been prepared by management using the Government’s
            accounting policies, which are based on Canadian public sector
            accounting standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the
            information in these financial statements. Some of the information
            in the financial statements is based on management's best estimates
            and judgment and gives due consideration to materiality. To fulfil
            its accounting and reporting responsibilities, management maintains
            a set of accounts that provides a centralized record of the NEB’s
            financial transactions. Financial information submitted in the
            preparation of the Public Accounts of Canada, and included in the
            NEB’s <em>Departmental Performance Report</em> is consistent with
            these financial statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management is also responsible for maintaining an effective system
            of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) designed to
            provide reasonable assurance that financial information is reliable,
            that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly
            authorized and recorded in accordance with the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and other applicable
            legislation, regulations, authorities and policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Management seeks to ensure the objectivity and integrity of data in
            its financial statements through careful selection, training, and
            development of qualified staff; through organizational arrangements
            that provide appropriate divisions of responsibility; through
            communication programs aimed at ensuring that regulations, policies,
            standards, and managerial authorities are understood throughout the
            NEB and through conducting an annual risk-based assessment of the
            effectiveness of the system of ICFR.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system of ICFR is designed to mitigate risks to a reasonable
            level based on an on-going process to identify key risks, to assess
            effectiveness of associated key controls, and to make any necessary
            adjustments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB will be subject to periodic Core Control Audits performed by
            the Office of the Comptroller General and will use the results of
            such audits to adhere to the Treasury Board
            <em>Policy on Internal Control</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the interim, the NEB has undertaken a risk-based assessment of
            the system of ICFR for the year ended March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2014, in
            accordance with the Treasury Board Policy on Internal Control, and
            the results and action plan is summarized in the
            <a href="#nnx">annex</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Office of the Auditor General, the independent auditor for the
            Government of Canada, has expressed an opinion on the fair
            presentation of the financial statements of the NEB which does not
            include an audit opinion on the annual assessment of the
            effectiveness of the department’s internal controls over financial
            reporting.

          <p id="s1"><strong>1. Authority and objectives</strong></p>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or the Board) is an independent
            federal regulator established in&nbsp;1959 to promote safety and
            security, environmental protection and economic efficiency in the
            Canadian public interest for the regulation of pipelines, energy
            development and trade. The Board reports to Parliament through the
            Minister of Natural Resources. The NEB was established under the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB Act) and is designated as a
            department and named under Schedule&nbsp;I.1 of the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board's responsibilities can be framed into the following
            program activity architecture which is also the basis for its
            segmented Statement of Operations:
          </p>
          <ul class="lst-upr-rmn ">
            <li>
              Energy Regulation<br />
              The Board’s responsibilities include regulating the construction
              and operation of interprovincial and international oil and gas
              pipelines, international power lines, and designated
              interprovincial power lines. The Board also regulates the tolls
              and tariffs of the pipelines under its jurisdiction as well as the
              export of natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids and electricity,
              and the import of natural gas. Additionally, the Board regulates
              oil and gas exploration and development on frontier lands and
              offshore areas not covered by provincial or federal management
              agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Energy Information<br />
              The Board monitors aspects of energy supply, demand, production,
              development and trade of all energy commodities that fall within
              the jurisdiction of the federal government. The Board publishes
              periodic assessments of Canadian supply and demand of energy and
              natural gas markets to inform Canadians on trends, events and
              issues which may affect Canadian energy markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Internal Services<br />
              The Board ensures that it has the capacity to deliver on its
              mandate by its commitment to enhancing its organizational
              performance by developing, nurturing and maintaining expertise in
              its people strategy.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB is an independent, federal, quasi-judicial regulatory
            tribunal guided by the principles of natural justice and procedural
            fairness. The Board is a court of record and has certain powers of a
            superior court with respect to the attendance, swearing and
            examination of witnesses; the production and inspection of
            documents; the enforcement of its orders; the entry on and
            inspection of property; and other matters necessary or proper for
            the due exercise of its jurisdiction. Aside from rare exceptions,
            the Board's regulatory decisions and the accompanying Reasons for
            Decision are issued as public documents.
          </p>

            The financial statements of the National Energy Board have been
            prepared as at March&nbsp;31 which corresponds with the Board’s
            year-end. Prior to&nbsp;2014, the Board had issued financial
            statements as at December&nbsp;31 in conjunction with its
            calculation and allocation of recoverable costs performed on a
            calendar year basis in accordance with the NEB Cost Recovery
            Regulations. Cost recovery calculations performed on a calendar year
            basis are included in a <a href="#schdl">Schedule</a> to these
            financial statements.

            <strong>2. Summary of significant accounting policies</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            These financial statements have been prepared using the Government’s
            accounting policies stated below, which are based on Canadian public
            sector accounting standards. The presentation and results using the
            stated accounting policies do not result in any significant
            differences from Canadian public sector accounting standards.
          </p>
          <p>Significant accounting policies are as follows:</p>
          <ul class="lst-lwr-alph " id="s2a">
            <li>
              Parliamentary authorities<br />
              <br />
              The NEB is financed by the Government of Canada through
              Parliamentary authorities. Financial reporting of authorities
              provided to the NEB do not parallel financial reporting according
              to generally accepted accounting principles since authorities are
              primarily based on cash flow requirements. Consequently, items
              recognized in the Statement of Operations and Net Financial
              Position and the Statement of Financial Position are not
              necessarily the same as those provided through authorities from
              Parliament. <a href="#s3">Note&nbsp;3</a> provides a high-level
              reconciliation between the bases of reporting. The planned results
              amounts in the Statement of Operations, the Net Financial Position
              and the Statement of Change in Net Debt are the amounts reported
              in the future-oriented financial statements included in
              the&nbsp;2013-2014 <em>Report on Plans and Priorities</em>.<br />
              <br />
              Liquidity risk is the risk that the Board will encounter
              difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial
              liabilities. The NEB’s objective for managing liquidity risk is to
              manage operations and cash expenditures within the appropriation
              authorized by Parliament or allotment limits approved by the
              Treasury Board.<br />
              <br />
              Each year, the Board presents information on planned expenditures
              to Parliament through the tabling of Estimates publications. These
              estimates result in the introduction of supply bills (which, once
              passed into legislation, become appropriation acts) in accordance
              with the reporting cycle for government expenditures. The Board
              exercises expenditure initiation processes such that unencumbered
              balances of budget allotments and appropriations are monitored and
              reported on a regular basis to help ensure sufficient authority
              remains for the entire period and appropriations are not
              exceeded.<br />
              <br />
              Consistent with Section&nbsp;32 of the
              <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, the Board’s policy to
              manage liquidity risk is that no contract or other arrangement
              providing for a payment shall be entered into with respect to any
              program for which there is an appropriation by Parliament or an
              item included in estimates then before the House of Commons to
              which the payment will be charged unless there is a sufficient
              unencumbered balance available out of the appropriation or item to
              discharge any debt that, under the contract or other arrangement,
              will be incurred during the fiscal year in which the contract or
              other arrangement is entered into.<br />
              <br />
              The NEB’s risk exposure and its objectives, policies and processes
              to manage and measure this risk did not change significantly from
              the prior year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Net cash provided by (to) Government<br />
              <br />
              The NEB operates within the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), which
              is administered by the Receiver General for Canada. All cash
              received by the NEB is deposited to the CRF and all cash
              disbursements made by the NEB are paid from the CRF. The net cash
              provided by/to Government is the difference between all cash
              receipts and all cash disbursements including transactions between
              departments of the federal government.
            </li>
            <li>
              Amounts due from or to the Consolidated Revenue Fund<br />
              <br />
              Amounts due from or to the CRF are the result of timing
              differences at year-end between when a transaction affects
              authorities and when it is processed through the CRF. Amounts due
              from the CRF represent the net amount of cash that the NEB is
              entitled to draw from the CRF without further authorities to
              discharge its liabilities. This amount is not considered to be a
              financial instrument.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revenues:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The NEB has the authority to charge those companies that it
                  regulates, in accordance with sub-section&nbsp;24.1 of the NEB
                  Act, the costs attributable to the NEB’s operations in
                  carrying out its responsibilities. Under the National Energy
                  Board Cost Recovery Regulations (Regulations) approved by
                  Treasury Board, effective January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1991, the NEB
                  recovers, from the companies that it regulates, the cost of
                  its operations. Revenues from regulatory levies are recognized
                  in the accounts when they are invoiced and, in accordance with
                  the Regulations, are based on the estimated cost of operations
                  for the calendar year, with a billing adjustment to actual
                  costs once the costs are known. Actual costs are defined as
                  the sum of one-quarter of year 1 audited fiscal costs (January
                  to March) and three-quarters of year&nbsp;2 audited fiscal
                  costs (April to December). The recoverable costs for a given
                  calendar year are allocated to the oil, gas and electricity
                  commodities proportionately on the basis of the actual time
                  spent by Board members and employees during the preceding
                  fiscal year (April&nbsp;1 to March&nbsp;31).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Other revenues are accounted for in the period in which the
                  underlying transaction or event occurred that gave rise to the
                  revenues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Revenues are non-respendable and are not available to
                  discharge the NEB’s liabilities. While the Chair is expected
                  to maintain accounting control, he or she has no authority
                  regarding the disposition of non-respendable revenues. As a
                  result, non-respendable revenues are considered to be earned
                  on behalf of the Government of Canada and are therefore
                  presented in reduction of the entity’s gross revenues.

            <li>
              Expenses<br />
              <br />
              Expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Vacation pay and compensatory leave are expensed as the
                  benefits accrue to employees under their respective terms of
                  employment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Services provided without charge by other government
                  departments for accommodation, the employer's contribution to
                  the health and dental insurance plans, and legal and audit
                  services are recorded as operating expenses at their estimated
                  cost. These estimated amounts for services received without
                  charge are recoverable costs under the Regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Expenditures of the Board that are excluded from Cost Recovery
                  Regulations are those expenditures related to the regulation
                  of, exploration for, and the development of oil and gas on
                  frontier lands and offshore areas and are disclosed im

                </li>
                <li>
                  Transfer payments are recorded as expenses when authorization
                  for the payment exists and the recipient has met the
                  eligibility criteria or the entitlements established for the
                  transfer payment program.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Employee future benefits
              <ul class="lst-lwr-rmn ">
                <li>
                  Pension benefits: Eligible employees participate in the Public
                  Service Pension Plan (Plan), a multiemployer pension plan
                  administered by the Government of Canada. The NEB
                  contributions to the Plan are charged to expenses in the year
                  incurred and represent the total departmental obligation to
                  the Plan. The NEB’s responsibility with regard to the Plan is
                  limited to its contributions. Actuarial surpluses or
                  deficiencies are recognized in the financial statements of the
                  Government of Canada, as the Plan’s sponsor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Severance benefits: Certain employees are entitled to
                  severance benefits under labour contracts or conditions of
                  employment and these benefits are earned as services necessary
                  to earn them are rendered. The obligation relating to the
                  benefits earned by employees is calculated using information
                  derived from the results of the actuarilly determined
                  liability for employee severance benefits for the Government
                  as a whole.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Accounts receivable<br />
              <br />
              Accounts receivable are stated at the lower of cost and net
              recoverable value. A valuation allowance is recorded for
              receivables where recovery is considered uncertain. In addition, a
              distinction is made between financial assets that are available to
              discharge the NEB’s liabilities versus the ones that are not.
              Accounts receivable that pertain to non-respendable revenues
              earned on behalf of government are considered to be held on behalf
              of the Government of Canada and are therefore presented in the
              Statement of Financial Position as a reduction of the entity’s
              gross financial assets. Credit risk is the risk that one party to
              a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other
              party by failing to discharge an obligation. The NEB is not
              exposed to significant credit risk. The NEB provides services to
              other government departments and agencies and to external parties
              in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable are due on
              demand and there is minimal potential risk of loss. The maximum
              exposure the NEB has to credit risk equal to the carrying value of
              its accounts receivables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contingent liabilities<br />
              <br />
              Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities which may become
              actual liabilities when one or more future events occur or fail to
              occur. To the extent that the future event is likely to occur or
              fail to occur, and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made,
              an estimated liability is accrued and an expense recorded. If the
              likelihood is not determinable or an amount cannot be reasonably
              estimated, the contingency is disclosed in the notes to the
              financial statements.

              Tangible capital assets under development are recorded as assets

              Measurement uncertainty<br />
              <br />
              The preparation of these financial statements requires management
              to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
              of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial
              statements. At the time of preparation of these statements,
              management believes the estimates and assumptions to be
              reasonable. The most significant items where estimates are used
              are recoverable operating costs, contingent liabilities, the
              liability for employee future benefits, allowance for doubtful
              accounts and the useful life of tangible capital assets. Actual
              results could significantly differ from those estimated.
              Management's estimates are reviewed periodically and, as
              adjustments become necessary, they are recorded in the financial
              statements in the year they become known.

            The NEB receives most of its funding through annual parliamentary
            authorities. The majority of these expenditures are subsequently
            recovered from the companies regulated by the NEB and the funds are
            deposited in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Government of
            Canada. Items recognized in the Statement of Operations and Net
            Financial Position and the Statement of Financial Position in one
            year may be funded through Parliamentary authorities in prior,
            current or future years. Accordingly, the NEB has different net
            results of operations for the year on a government funding basis
            than on an accrual accounting basis. The differences are reconciled
            in the following tables:

              <strong>Pension benefits:</strong><br />
              <br />
              The NEB's employees participate in the Public Service Pension Plan
              (Plan), which is sponsored and administered by the Government.
              Pension benefits accrue up to a maximum period of 35 years at a
              rate of 2&nbsp;percent per year of pensionable service, times the
              average of the best five consecutive years of earnings. The
              benefits are integrated with Canada/Québec Pension Plans benefits
              and they are indexed to inflation.<br />
              <br />
              Both the employees and the NEB contribute to the cost of the Plan.
              The 2013-14 expense amounts to $5,903,589 ($5,382,478
              in&nbsp;2012-13), which represents approximately 1.6&nbsp;times
              (1.7 in&nbsp;2012-13) the contributions by employees.<br />
              <br />
              The NEB's responsibility with regard to the Plan is limited to its
              contributions. Actuarial surpluses or deficiencies are recognized
              in the financial statements of the Government of Canada, as the
              Plan's sponsor.

              <strong>Severance benefits:</strong><br />
              <br />
              The NEB provides severance benefits to its employees based on
              eligibility, years of service and salary at termination of
              employment. These severance benefits are not pre-funded and
              benefits will be paid from future authorities.<br />
              <br />
              Commencing in&nbsp;2012, and due to changes to conditions of
              employment for executives and certain non-represented employees,
              the accumulation of severance benefits under the employee
              severance pay program ceased for these employees. Employees
              subject to these changes have been given the option to be
              immediately paid the full or partial value of benefits earned to
              date or collect the full or remaining value of benefits on
              termination from the public service. These changes have been
              reflected in the calculation of the outstanding severance benefit
              obligation and reflect management’s best estimate of these future
              events.<br />
              <br />
              Details of the severance benefits, measured as at March&nbsp;31,

              <strong>Claims and litigation</strong><br />
              <br />
              Claims have been made against the NEB in the normal course of
              operations. These claims include items with pleading amounts and
              other for which no amount is specified. Based on the NEB's
              assessment, legal proceedings for claims estimated at $4,200,000
              were pending at March&nbsp;31, 2014 ($4,230,000
              in&nbsp;2012-2013); however the outcome is undeterminable. Some of
              these potential liabilities may become actual liabilities when one
              or more future events occur or fail to occur. To the extent that
              the future event is likely to occur or fail to occur, and a
              reasonable estimate of the loss can be made, an estimated
              liability is accrued and an expense recorded in the financial
              statements.

            The NEB is related as a result of common ownership to all government
            departments, agencies, and Crown Corporations. The NEB enters into
            transactions with these entities in the normal course of business
            and on normal trade terms. During the year, the NEB received
            services which were obtained without charge from other government
            departments as discussed below.

                The Government has centralized some of its administrative
                activities for efficiency, cost-effectiveness purposes and
                economic delivery of programs to the public. As a result, the
                Government uses central agencies and common service
                organizations so that one department performs services for all
                other departments and agencies without charge.

            In accordance with the Cost Recovery regulations recoverable
            operating costs are based on the expenditures for the calendar year.
            A calendar year is the period from January&nbsp;1 to
            December&nbsp;31. The operating costs for Calendar&nbsp;2012 are
            from the 2012&nbsp;calendar year financial statements. The
            2013&nbsp;recoverable operating costs are based on fiscal
            year&nbsp;2012-2013 statements less costs already recovered from
            April to December&nbsp;2012 plus three quarters of&nbsp;2013-2014
            costs. For fiscal years subsequent to&nbsp;2013-2014, the
            recoverable expenses will be calculated using one quarter of
            recoverable expenses from the prior fiscal year and three quarters
            of recoverable expenses from the current fiscal year. The
            methodology used by management to determine actual costs is reviewed
            on a periodic basis and adjusted for significant events.

          <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>
            In support of an effective system of internal control, the National
            Energy Board (NEB) annually assesses the performance of its
            financial controls to ensure that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Financial arrangements or contracts are entered into only when
              sufficient funding is available;
            </li>
            <li>
              Payments for goods and services are made only when the goods or
              services are received or the conditions of contracts or other
              arrangements have been satisfied; and
            </li>
            <li>Payments have been properly authorized</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB will leverage the results of the periodic core control
            audits performed by the Office of the Comptroller General. Below is
            a summary of the results of the assessment conducted during fiscal
            year&nbsp;2013-14.
          </p>
          <strong>2. Assessment results during fiscal year&nbsp;2013-14</strong>
          <p>
            For the most part, controls related to payment for goods and
            services and payment authority were functioning well and form an
            adequate basis for the department’s system of internal control. The
            following adjustment was made in&nbsp;2013-2014 to strengthen
            control:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All employees are now required to sign an annual acknowledgement
              of their understanding and compliance with the Code of Conduct
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>3. Assessment plan</strong></p>
          <p>
            The NEB will continue to monitor the performance of its system of
            internal control, with a focus on the core controls related to
            financial transactions.

          </p>
          <h2 id="s1">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB) is committed to providing an
            inclusive workplace. The NEB has a strong interest in supporting
            employee attraction and retention. The initiatives are based on the
            principles of Employment Equity, and embrace and extend beyond the
            legislative requirements under the <em>Employment Equity Act.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Employment Equity looks at the following groups when determining
            gaps in a work force:  Women, Aboriginal People, Visible Minorities
            and Persons with Disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This annual report on Employment Equity for the NEB provides a
            description of Employment Equity activities and an analysis of the
            results achieved during the reporting period from 01 April 2012 to
            31 March 2013. In addition, the report provides a workforce
            description of the employees at the NEB as of 31 March 2013, and
            includes an analysis of internal representation versus labour market
            availability.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s1_1">The Organization</h3>
          <p>
            The NEB is an independent, federal, quasi-judicial regulatory
            tribunal. The NEB’s corporate purpose is to regulate pipelines,
            energy development and trade in the Canadian public interest. The
            NEB’s vision is to be active and effective in Canada’s pursuit of a
            sustainable energy future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main functions of the NEB are set out in the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em>. The NEB also has regulatory
            responsibilities under the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> and certain provisions of
            the <em>Canada Petroleum Resources Act</em>. The NEB has specific
            responsibilities under the <em>Energy Administration Act</em> and
            the <em>Northern Pipeline Act</em>. In addition, some NEB staff are
            appointed Health and Safety Officers by the Minister of Labour to
            administer Part II of the <em>Canada Labour Code</em> as it applies
            to facilities regulated by the Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            All employees of the NEB are headquartered in a single work location
            in Calgary. Since February 2004, all unionized employees have been
            represented by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of
            Canada (PIPSC), the one union certified as the Bargaining Agent for
            the NEB.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB follows a strategic planning process that establishes
            priorities to meet its mandate. In the current environment of
            increasing global demand for safe and secure supplies of energy and
            continuing high energy prices, the NEB’s role as Canada’s national
            energy regulator is as important as ever. We are challenged to
            maintain a skilled and knowledgeable workforce in a very competitive
            employment market, especially in Calgary where a thriving private
            sector oil &amp; gas industry makes it difficult to attract and
            retain qualified staff. We continue to work toward promoting
            diversity and eliminating barriers to employment.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s1_2">Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Data Sources:  This report uses 2006 Census Availability data
            received from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada to
            compare overall representation of the designated groups at the NEB
            with the composition of the Canadian population. The National
            Occupational Codes (NOC) codes are in compliance with the new coding
            system. This report further compares internal representation to
            availability data by Employment Equity Occupational Group.
          </p>
          <p>
            HRDC’s Workplace Equity Information Management System (WEIMS), is
            used to determine the statistics within this report.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s2">Employment Equity Initiatives</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB Employment Equity and Diversity Plan (EEDP) 2011-2014
            focuses on achieving excellence through our employees. Given the
            unique role that the NEB plays on behalf of the Canadian public, the
            greatest challenge is to attract and retain the best people
            possible. The EEDP recognizes that we must embrace and represent
            diversity and move beyond considering diversity as a purely
            intellectual exercise to it becoming an inherent component of our
            organizational culture. The EEDP is monitored, reported on and
            updated annually.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is in the process of reviewing the
            <em>Duty to Accommodate Policy</em>; procedures and guidelines will
            be finalized in the fall of 2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intent is to ensure this policy provides for an inclusive,
            barrier-free, non-discriminatory workplace, allowing for the full
            participation of both its employees and selection process
            candidates.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_1">Aboriginal Engagement Program</h3>
          <p>
            During this reporting period, the NEB continued to refine its
            Aboriginal Engagement Program by targeting recruitment of Aboriginal
            candidates. Part of the purpose of this program is to increase
            internal capacity to understand aboriginal issues and, in turn,
            raise the awareness in Aboriginal communities of the role of the
            NEB.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, in partnership with other federal departments and
            industry in Calgary, the NEB continues to promote and encourage
            employees to participate in meetings and celebrations respecting
            diversity, as well as commemorative events and awareness training.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_2">Persons with Disabilities</h3>
          <p>
            With the creation of the <em>Duty to Accommodate Policy,</em> our
            focus has been to promote an inclusive healthy and productive work
            environment. Accommodation is provided to employees as required and
            includes providing modified work to injured workers. Work schedules
            are adjusted to provide variable start times where circumstances
            warrant and modified work weeks are provided whenever feasible.
            Ergonomic assessments of individual work stations continue to be
            provided on a priority basis to employees with medical certificates.
            Employees with disabilities who require that measures be implemented
            in order to accommodate their needs are given immediate attention.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_3">Other Related Initiatives</h3>
          <p>
            All new employees participate in an Orientation to the Organization:
            two half-day sessions which include an introduction to the NEB’s
            EEDP initiatives. The NEB is in the process of developing an on-line
            orientation course for new employees, and it is anticipated this
            will be available in the coming year.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the reporting period, “Respectful Workplace” training
            sessions were held regularly. This training was recently updated and
            made mandatory for all employees. Since 2003, the NEB has made
            available the services of an Ombudsperson who is available to all
            employees to discuss harassment and discrimination issues and
            situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB’s Employment Equity and Diversity Committee is comprised of
            Senior Management (Champion); Professional Institute of the Public
            Service of Canada (PIPSC) Union representation, Employment Equity
            Members (employees) and Human Resources. The Committee is
            responsible for monitoring the progress of the EEDP and for making
            recommendations to enhance the program. Consultations with employee
            representatives on employment equity initiatives take place within
            the mandate of the NEB Union-Management Consultation Committee.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s3">Workforce Analysis</h2>
          <h3 id="s3_1">Availability Data</h3>
          <p>
            The most recent Labour Market Availability results are from the 2006
            Census Data, and this information was used for making comparisons.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s3_2">Employee Population</h3>
          <p>
            The workforce analysis was conducted on the total employee
            population with the exception of those employees who work less than
            12.5 hours/week. In addition, the following persons were
            <strong>not</strong> included in the NEB workforce analysis:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Governor-in-Council appointments: Chair/CEO, Vice-Chair, and Board
              Members;
            </li>
            <li>
              Persons who were brought into the NEB on Interchange from other
              Federal Government departments/agencies and private industry; or
            </li>
            <li>Persons who worked for a period less than thirteen weeks.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="s3_3">Self-Identification</h3>
          <p>
            The Self-Identification initiative continues to be a mandatory
            process for all employees. Mandatory information includes their name
            and signature, the other information is voluntary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only those employees who <em>voluntarily identify</em> themselves as
            Aboriginal People, Visible Minorities or Persons with Disabilities
            are counted as members of designated groups for the purpose of
            conducting this workforce analysis and implementing Employment
            Equity. Women were also included but identified using information
            provided by the NEB’s Human Resources Information System (HRIS).
          </p>
          <h3 id="s3_4">Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            An analysis to determine the level of representation of designated
            groups within the Board was conducted and conclusions appear before
            each table. It is important to note that, because of our small
            workforce, a change of one or two individuals within the designated
            group can change percentages up or down dramatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Source of information comes from the 2006 Census Data with the
            exception of Persons with Disabilities where the source is the 2006
            Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (PALS) and Employer's
            Internal Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Percentages within the tables have been rounded, in some cases to
            the nearest decimal point in other cases to the nearest whole
            number.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s4">Analysis of Total Employee Population</h2>
          <p>
            An analysis of the total employee population was conducted, and the
            results by gender and designated group members are shown in Table 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Table 1 shows that as of 31 March 2013, the total employee
            population was 400 employees, made up of 346 full-time, 23
            part-time, and 31 temporary employees.Men comprised 40.0% of the
            total population<strong>,</strong> while Women had a representation
            of 60.0%, a slight increase from last year. People representation of
            5.3% decreased by 0.5% since 31 March 2011. The representation of
            Visible Minorities and Persons with Disabilities remained relatively
            unchanged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Table 1 also shows the percentage of representation by designated
            groups compared with the labour market availability data. From these
            comparisons, it can be seen that in the total population, all groups
            have a higher internal representation than their representation at
            NEB in the overall labour market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Employment Equity under-representation is determined by comparing
            the representation within an occupational category with its
            workforce availability. The NEB workforce analysis shows these
            results:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Women:</strong> Overall exceed workforce availability in
            this group.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Aboriginal</strong>:  Overall exceed workforce availability
            in this group.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Visible Minorities</strong>: Overall meet workforce
            availability, however data indicates a shortage in three
            occupational categories; Middle and Other Managers (-1), Supervisors
            (-1), and Clerical Personnel (-1).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Persons with Disabilities:</strong> Overall exceed workforce
            availability in this group however data indicates a shortage in one
            occupational category; Professionals (-1).
          </p>
          <h3 id="s4_1">Summary</h3>
          <p>
            We remain committed to promoting diversity within the workforce and
            continue to improve our representation in the various groups.

          <h2 id="s5">Analysis by Employment Equity Occupational Groups</h2>
          <p>
            Table 2 shows the breakdown into Employment Equity occupational
            groups of the total employee population by gender and designated
            groups. For each occupational group, the representation by gender
            and designated group members is given in whole numbers, as well as a
            proportion of the total number of employees (the first percentage
            figure at the bottom of each cell). The availability data is the
            percentage figure that follows.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_1">Senior Managers</h3>
          <p>
            Table 2 shows that as of 31 March 2013, there were 11 senior
            managers employed at the NEB.Of these, three were women, which, at
            27.3% is higher than the overall Calgary labour market availability
            data of 24.2%. Of these 11, one is a Visible Minority and two are
            Persons with Disabilities. There is no representation of Aboriginal
            People in this group.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_2">Middle Managers</h3>
          <p>
            While there was an increase from 25 to 26 middle managers
            (designated at the NEB as Directors) between 2012 and 2013, the
            representation of Women increased from 40% to 50%. Similar to the
            previous report in 2012, Visible Minorities were slightly
            under-represented (11.5% vs. 14.0% availability). There continues to
            be no representation of Aboriginal People in this group.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_3">Professionals</h3>
          <p>
            The Professional group is comprised of financial officers,
            engineers, economists, environmental specialists, human resources
            advisors, communications advisors, information systems specialists,
            translators and lawyers.In this occupational group, Women were well
            representedcompared with the availability data (54.6% vs. 40.8%) as
            were Aboriginal People (4.4% vs. 1.9%).Persons with Disabilities (4%
            vs. 4.5% availability) were about equal and Visible Minorities
            (15.7% vs. 15.2% availability) are well-represented.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_4">Semi-Professionals and Technicians</h3>
          <p>
            The Semi-Professionals and Technicians occupational group includes
            geological technologists, engineering inspectors, library
            technicians, information technology service analysts, and graphic
            designers. Women are well represented in this group (55.2% vs.
            50.1%). Aboriginal People are recognized as being over-represented
            (10.3% vs. 1.9%) as well as Persons with Disabilities (10.3% vs.
            4.5%). Visible Minorities (10.3% vs. 11.9%) continue to be
            under-represented.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_5">Supervisors</h3>
          <p>
            There are three employees in this occupational group. That makes up
            the entire complement and 100% are women; no other representation is
            present in this group.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_6">Administrative and Senior Clerical</h3>
          <p>
            Women made up the vast majority of the NEB’s complement in the
            Administrative and Senior Clerical occupational group, which
            includes Business Unit Administrators, Human Resources Assistants,
            and Assistants to Board Members and other senior level
            administrative staff. Other Employment Equity groups appear
            adequately represented.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_7">Skilled Crafts and Trades</h3>
          <p>
            There was one employee in this occupational group that makes up the
            entire complement and therefore an analysis cannot be provided.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_8">Clerical Personnel</h3>
          <p>
            This category includes records, mail clerks and general
            administrative assistants. Women were adequately represented in this
            category (79.4% vs. 74%). Persons with Disabilities (8.8% vs. 4.4%),
            Aboriginal People (8.8% vs. 2.4%) and Visible Minorities (17.4% vs.
            19.5%) were adequately represented in this group, with only Visible
            Minorities being under-represented by 2.1%.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_9">Semi-Skilled Workers</h3>
          <p>
            There was one employee in this occupational group that makes up the
            entire complement and therefore an analysis cannot be provided.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s5_10">Summary</h3>
          <p>
            In conclusion, an analysis of occupational groups from an Employment
            Equity perspective demonstrates a commitment to Employment Equity,
            with opportunities for maintaining the level of excellence and
            increasing representation in some occupational groups for some
            categories. As per our Employment Equity Plan, we are committed to
            ensuring our selection processes do not restrict participation of
            potential candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Women were over-represented in the Administrative and Clerical
            Personnel groups, the majority of all Women employed at the NEB were
            found in the Professional or Semi-Professional occupational groups.
            In order to increase representation in the Senior Managers and
            Middle Managers categories, greater opportunities for upward
            mobility for all groups may need to be provided through leadership
            development, formal learning and access to internal developmental
            opportunities such as acting assignments and/or coaching. This is a
            consideration of the Emerging Leader and Technical Leadership
            programs whereby employees have an opportunity to gain skills and
            experiences for upward mobility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aboriginal People were well represented in the Professional,
            Semi-Professionals &amp; Technicians, Administrative and Senior
            Clerical and Clerical Personnel groups, with the majority found in
            the Professional group. There were no Aboriginal People in the other
            categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visible Minorities exceed the availability percentages in the Senior
            Managers, Middle Managers and Administrative and Senior Clerical
            groups. All other groups show an under-representation compared to
            workforce availability. There was no identified representation
            within the Supervisors, Skilled Crafts and Trades and Semi-Skilled
            groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Persons with Disabilities were well-represented in the Senior
            Managers, Semi-Professionals and Technicians and Clerical Personnel
            groups and under-represented in the Middle Managers and
            Administrative &amp; Senior Clerical groups. The majority of Persons
            with Disabilities were found in the Professional and Clerical
            Personnel groups. This gap is fairly consistent with the explanation
            offered for Visible Minorities

            Analysis of the Numbers of Employee Hires, Promotions and
            Regrettable Departures
          </h2>
          <p>
            Tables 3, 4 and 5 summarize new hire, promotion and regrettable
            departure activity between 01 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_1">Employee Hires</h3>
          <p>
            Table 3 reports 68 employee hires between 01 April 2012 and 31 March
            2013, which is up from 54 from the past reporting period. Of those,
            33 (48.5%) were Women. One Aboriginal, fourteen Visible Minorities
            and two Disabled Persons were hired.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_2">Employee Promotions</h3>
          <p>
            Table 4 shows that 51 employees were promoted during this period,
            down from 74 last year. The majority of actions (42 or 82.3%)
            occurred in the Professionals Group. Of the 51 promoted employees
            60.7% were Women.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_3">Employee Regrettable Departures</h3>
          <p>
            Table 5 reports that in this period, 43 employees left the NEB. Of
            these employees, 42% were Women (18) and 58% were Men (25).
            Departing employees were primarily in the Professional category (28
            of the 43, or 65%). This is not surprising considering that
            Calgary’s labour market continues to remain very competitive,
            especially in the oil and gas industry which impacts the Board’s
            attrition rate.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s6_4">Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Analysis of hires, promotions and regrettable departures suggests
            that Women accounted for the greatest staff movements into, within,
            and out of the NEB. Womenwere hired, promoted and departed at rates
            exceeding the overall labour market.
          </p>
          <p>
            One Aboriginal person was hired, six were promoted, and one departed
            the NEB.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourteen Visible Minorities were hired, six were promoted and six
            elected to leave the NEB. One possible reason for this gap is the
            large change in the Census data for the Visible Minorities
            Employment Equity group, which has increased significantly from 7.8%
            in the 1996 Census data to 14.7% in the 2006 Census data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inclusion of Landed Immigrants in the statistical data can be
            misleading for government departments and agencies, such as the NEB,
            that are regulated by the <em>Public Service Employment Act </em>and
            the <em>Security of Information Act</em>. External systemic barriers
            and the inability to facilitate security clearances from the country
            of origin for landed immigrants create barriers to the employment of
            some visible minorities.&nbsp; It is important to remember
            that&nbsp;under the provisions of the
            <em>Public Service Employment Act</em> (PSEA), departments are
            required to provide Canadian Citizens with a preference&nbsp;for
            employment opportunities. Foreign educational documentation is not
            recognized and often difficult to verify, creating delays in
            potential employment for immigrants whose credentials do not meet
            Canadian standards, especially in hard to find skill sets such as
            specialty engineers, geo-physicists, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were three promotions, two hired and three regrettable
            departures from the Persons with Disabilities group.

          <h2 id="s7">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB’s workforce is representative of Canadian society. As
            indicated in the statistics there were no gaps in any of the four
            employment equity groups; Women, Aboriginal People, Visible
            Minorities, or Persons with Disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the NEB has a small workforce, a change of one or two individuals
            can make a significant impact to the statistics. Therefore we
            continue to take into consideration our employment equity needs in
            every staffing action.
          </p>
          <p>
            As documented in the NEB’s People Strategy, retention is an
            integrated approach to human resources management as a result we
            created Talent Management Framework (TMF). The intention of the TMF
            is to attract and retain the right people with the right skills and
            expertise to contribute to our business objectives in an
            increasingly competitive labour market.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB continues to improve our outreach efforts to increase the
            representation of Visible Minorities and Person with Disabilities in
            those occupational groups where they are not well represented. In
            addition, although the NEB’s representation of Aboriginal People
            reflects well against the availability data, efforts will continue
            to include contacts with representatives of both secondary and
            post-secondary institutions that have responsibility for Aboriginal
            learners. Wherever possible, we will continue to liaise with
            Workforce Diversity Consultants in other government organizations to
            share inventories of available Aboriginal applicants. At a minimum,
            this will continue to provide us with access to Aboriginal
            candidates for future NEB selection processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Labour market availability for the Visible Minority group has
            increased with the inclusion of Landed Immigrants in Census data.
            This adjustment represents an increase in the representation target
            for the NEB. A diverse outreach team participated in a number of
            career fairs to promote NEB as a potential employer and to build
            relationships with post-secondary educational institutions. This
            approach will continue in order to increase our representation of
            Visible Minorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of our attraction and retention strategy for all employees,
            the NEB is committed to building a workplace that embraces
            inclusiveness and diversity. The NEB will continue to be innovative
            to ensure that any gains made with respect to the hiring and
            retention of members of the designated Employment Equity groups are
            not eroded.

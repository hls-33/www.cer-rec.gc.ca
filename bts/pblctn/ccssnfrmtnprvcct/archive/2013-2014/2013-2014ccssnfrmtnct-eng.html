          <h3>Access to Information Act</h3>
          <p>
            The Access to Information Act (Act) gives the Canadian public a
            right to access information contained in federal government records,
            subject to certain specific and limited exceptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In accordance with section&nbsp;72 of the Act, the head of every
            federal institution is required to submit an Annual Report to
            Parliament on the administration of the Act following the close of
            each fiscal year. The Annual Reports are then tabled in Parliament
            pursuant to section&nbsp;72 of the Act. This report describes how
            the National Energy Board (NEB or Board) fulfilled its access to
            information responsibilities during the fiscal year 2013-2014.
          </p>
          <h3>About the National Energy Board</h3>
          <p>
            The Board is an independent federal regulator established in 1959 to
            promote safety and security, environmental protection and economic
            efficiency in the Canadian public interest within the mandate set by
            Parliament for the regulation of pipelines, energy development and
            trade. The&nbsp;Board reports to Parliament through the Minister of
            Natural Resources. The Board regulates the following specific
            aspects of the energy industry:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the construction and operation of interprovincial and
              international pipelines;
            </li>
            <li>pipeline traffic, tolls and tariffs;</li>
            <li>
              the construction and operation of international and designated
              interprovincial power lines;
            </li>
            <li>the export and import of natural gas;</li>
            <li>the export of oil and electricity; and</li>
            <li>frontier oil and gas activities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other responsibilities include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              providing energy advice to the Minister of Natural Resources in
              areas where the Board has expertise derived from its regulatory
              functions;
            </li>
            <li>
              carrying out studies and preparing reports when requested by the
              Minister;
            </li>
            <li>conducting studies into specific energy matters;</li>
            <li>holding public inquiries when appropriate; and</li>
            <li>
              monitoring current and future supplies of Canada's major energy
              commodities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition to its responsibilities under the National Energy Board
            Act (NEB&nbsp;Act), the Board also has responsibilities under the
            Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act, the Canadian Environmental
            Assessment Act, the Northern Pipeline Act, and certain provisions of
            the Canada Petroleum Resources Act. As a result of the Canada
            Transportation Act, which came into effect on 1&nbsp;July&nbsp;1996,
            the Board's jurisdiction has been broadened to also include
            pipelines that transport commodities other than oil or natural gas.

          <h3>The Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Office</h3>
          <p>
            Activities relating to the Access to Information Act during the
            reporting period were the responsibility of the Secretary of the
            Board, who had been designated by the Chair and CEO of the Board as
            the Coordinator. Organizationally, the Access to Information and
            Privacy (ATIP) team resides within the Office of the Secretary and
            Regulatory Services Team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chair and CEO has overall responsibility for ensuring that the
            Board’s policies, procedures and practices are compliant with the
            application and administration of the Access to Information Act. The
            National Energy Board has procedures in place to process all formal
            and informal access to information requests. These requests are
            processed by the Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator who
            has the authority to access all records held by the Board. The ATIP
            Office works closely with Information and Document Services and
            Senior Management across the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ATIP Office is comprised of two permanent full-time Officers and
            one senior Officer on assignment from another department of the
            Board. The Executive Support Advisor oversees this team. In
            addition, the Board hired a contractor to assist part-time in the
            processing of ATIP requests. Taking into account the contractor, the
            delegated authority and the Executive Support Advisor who work
            part-time on Access to Information, there are currently
            4&nbsp;full-time equivalents (FTEs) in the Board’s ATIP Office.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to providing legal advice and guidance to the ATIP
            Office on all issues related to the application of the Act, the
            Board’s Legal Services, in general, assist the offices of primary
            interest within the Board and the ATIP Office in the delivery of
            their program and activities having an Access to Information Act
            component.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ATIP Office is responsible for the coordination and
            implementation of policies, guidelines and procedures to ensure the
            organization’s compliance with the Access to Information Act. The
            office also provides the following services to the organization:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Promoting awareness of the Access to Information Act within the
              organization
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
              Providing advice and guidance to employees and senior officials on
              access related matters
            </li>

            <li>Developing internal procedures</li>
            <li>
              Participating in forums for the ATIP community, such as the
              Treasury Board Secretariat ATIP Community meetings and working
              groups
            </li>
          </ul>

          </p>
          <h3>Info Source</h3>
          <p>
            Info Source is a series of publications containing information about
            and/or collected by the Government of Canada. The primary purpose of
            Info Source is to assist individuals in exercising their rights
            under the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. Info Source
            also supports the federal government’s commitment to facilitate
            access to information regarding its activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this reporting period, the ATIP Office updated the content of
            its Info Source chapter, now self-published by the NEB, including
            the description of its information holdings by institutional
            functions, programs and activities. The NEB’s chapter is aligned
            with its Program Activity Architecture. Under this approach, all
            classes of records and personal information banks are directly
            linked to the relevant institutional program and/or activity.
          </p>
          <h3>Reading Room</h3>
          <p>
            Section&nbsp;71 of the Access to Information Act requires government
            institutions to provide facilities where members of the public may
            obtain information such as Info Source. The following National
            Energy Board location in Calgary has been designated as a public
            reading room:
          </p>
          <p>
            National Energy Board Library<br />
            2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Floor, 517 &ndash; 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Avenue
            SW<br />
            Calgary, AB &nbsp;T2R&nbsp;0A8
          </p>
          <h3>Workload</h3>
          <p>
            Workload in 2013-2014 was comparable to the workload experienced in
            2012-2013 with respect to the number of requests received. The
            number of access to information requests received can be
            demonstrated by the following chart:
          </p>
          <img
            src="/bts/pblctn/ccssnfrmtnprvcct/archive/2013-2014/mg/mg02-eng.jpg"
            alt="Number of Requests Received"
            class="image-responsive center-block block brdr-tp brdr-rght brdr-bttm brdr-lft"
          />
          <p>
            The NEB has invested in ATIP with additional funding, training and
            mentoring to retain the current ATIP staff. As a direct result of
            these resources, the NEB was able to respond to 82% of all access to
            information requests within the legislated timeframes. The NEB also
            eliminated its backlog of requests and prevented buildups from
            increasing. The Board continues to make a strong effort to keep up
            with the unprecedented number of requests.
          </p>
          <h3>Highlights and Accomplishments for 2013-2014</h3>
          <p>
            The NEB has continued to improve the way in which it responds to
            Access to Information Act requests, by focusing on improving
            timeliness, efficiency and accuracy. Some of the highlights are as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The NEB concluded the year with 82&nbsp;percent of requests
              completed within statutory deadlines;
            </li>
            <li>
              The NEB has remained committed to on-time performance in the face
              of the continued high volume of requests and consultations
              received from other institutions;
            </li>
            <li>
              Training sessions, focusing exclusively on the Access to
              Information Act and the NEB’s procedures for processing requests,
              were held throughout the year;
            </li>
            <li>
              All institution specific classes of records relating to the NEB’s
              information holdings were included in updates in Info Source and
              self-published on the Board’s website; and
            </li>
            <li>
              The Board posted and communicated new procedural documents,
              including those that form part of the Privacy Management
              Framework.

          </p>
          <p>
            Of those eight&nbsp;requests in which all documents were disclosed,
            two were completed in 1 &ndash; 15&nbsp;days, five were completed in
            16 &ndash; 30&nbsp;days and one was completed in 121 to
            180&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the 60&nbsp;requests disclosed in part, one was completed in 1
            &ndash; 15&nbsp;days, six were completed in 16 &ndash; 30&nbsp;days,
            21 were completed in 31 &ndash; 60&nbsp;days, 24 were completed in
            61 &ndash; 120&nbsp;days, one was completed in 121 &ndash;
            180&nbsp;days, and 7 were completed in 181 &ndash; 365&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the three&nbsp;requests where nothing was disclosed due to
            exemptions, two were completed in 1 &ndash; 15&nbsp;days and 1 was
            completed in 16 to 30&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the one request were nothing was disclosed due to exclusions, it
            was completed in less than 15&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the Board had no records, 23 of the 26&nbsp;requests were
            completed in less than 15&nbsp;days and 3 were completed in 16
            &ndash; 30&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            In both cases where the NEB transferred a request, the transfer was
            completed in less than 15&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 10&nbsp;cases where requests were abandoned by the applicant,
            two were abandoned in less than 15&nbsp;days, one was abandoned in
            16 &ndash; 30&nbsp;days, five were abandoned in the 31 &ndash;
            60&nbsp;days and two were abandoned in the 121 to 180&nbsp;day

          <h4>Exemptions</h4>
          <p>
            The following exemptions were invoked during the processing of

          <h4>Exclusions</h4>
          <p>
            The Access to Information Act does not apply to published material,
            material available to the public for purchase or for public
            reference (section&nbsp;68). Nor does it apply to confidences of the
            Queen’s Privy Council, with some exemptions (section&nbsp;69).
            Requests containing proposed exclusions under section&nbsp;69
            require consultation with the Privy Council Office. There were
            three&nbsp;requests received during the reporting period in which
            exclusions were applied pursuant to section&nbsp;68(a) of the Act.
          </p>
          <h4>Format of Information Released</h4>
          <p>
            Of the eight&nbsp;requests that were disclosed in their entirety,
            the requesters received paper copies of the information in
            6&nbsp;cases and two&nbsp;requests were released in electronic
            format.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the 60&nbsp;requests that were disclosed in part, the requesters
            received paper copies of the information in 27&nbsp;cases and
            33&nbsp;requests were released in electronic format.
          </p>
          <h4>Complexity</h4>
          <p>
            The number of pages processed means the number of pages that were
            analyzed to determine whether the information can be disclosed,
            exempt or excluded. It does not reflect the number of pages that
            were examined to determine relevancy. A partially disclosed page
            would be counted as a page disclosed.
          </p>
          <h4>Relevant pages processed and disclosed</h4>
          <p>
            In the eight&nbsp;cases where all documents were disclosed, the NEB
            processed 107&nbsp;pages and disclosed 107&nbsp;pages. In the
            60&nbsp;cases where documents were disclosed in part, the NEB
            processed 11,666&nbsp;pages and disclosed 8,700&nbsp;pages. Where
            information was all excluded or all exempted nothing was processed
            or disclosed. In the 10&nbsp;requests that were abandoned, the NEB
            processed 1649&nbsp;pages and disclosed 561&nbsp;pages.
          </p>
          <h4>Relevant pages processed and disclosed by size of requests</h4>
          <p>
            In the 64&nbsp;instances where less than 100&nbsp;pages were
            processed, the NEB disclosed 1053&nbsp;pages. Where
            101-500&nbsp;pages were processed, the NEB disclosed 2158&nbsp;pages
            for those 13&nbsp;requests. In response to one request where
            501-1000&nbsp;pages were processed, the NEB disclosed
            532&nbsp;pages. Four&nbsp;requests required the processing of 1001
            &ndash; 5000&nbsp;pages and, in those cases, 5625&nbsp;pages were
            disclosed.
          </p>
          <h4>Other complexities</h4>
          <p>
            In certain cases, there were factors that increased the complexity
            of requests. In 44&nbsp;cases, consultations were required, fees
            were assessed for the completion of two&nbsp;requests and legal
            advice was sought on 29&nbsp;requests completed during the reporting
            period. Other complexities identified throughout the reporting
            period included three&nbsp;requests for information deemed to be of
            a high-profile subject matter and three&nbsp;requests were
            abandoned.
          </p>
          <h4>Deemed Refusals</h4>
          <p>
            Requests are considered to fall into a deemed refusal status when
            they have not been answered within the deadlines (either the
            original 30-day period or within an extended period).
          </p>
          <h4>Reasons for not meeting statutory deadline</h4>
          <p>
            The Board met statutory deadlines for over 82% of the requests
            closed during the reporting period. There were 20&nbsp;requests that
            the Board did not close within the statutory (original or extended)
            deadline. The reason for not meeting the deadline in six of those
            cases was due to workload, in five&nbsp;instances, external
            consultation was the reason, in 6&nbsp;cases, internal consultations
            were the reason for not meeting the statutory deadline. There were
            3&nbsp;requests that the Board did not close within the statutory
            deadline for other reasons.
          </p>
          <h4>Number of days past deadline</h4>
          <p>
            Where no extension was taken, the Board exceeded the deadline for
            two&nbsp;requests by 1 &ndash; 15&nbsp;days, for one request by 16
            &ndash; 30&nbsp;days, another for 31 &ndash; 60&nbsp;days and two
            for 31 &ndash; 120&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 14&nbsp;cases when the NEB responded past the deadline where
            an extension was taken, two were completed 1 &ndash; 15&nbsp;days
            past the deadline, three were completed 16 &ndash; 30&nbsp;days past
            the deadline, one was completed 31 &ndash; 60&nbsp;days past the
            deadline, five were completed 61 &ndash; 120&nbsp;days past the
            deadline and three were completed 121-180&nbsp;days past the
            deadline.
          </p>
          <h4>Requests for translation</h4>
          <p>
            No translations were required to respond to 2013-2014 access
            requests.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sv3">PART&nbsp;3 &ndash; Extensions</h3>
          <h4>Reasons for extensions and disposition of requests</h4>
          <p>
            Legal extensions were most frequently invoked to provide time to
            search through voluminous records and to conduct third party
            notifications. In the two&nbsp;cases case where all records were
            disclosed, one extension was taken under&nbsp;9(1)(a) and one was
            taken under&nbsp;9(1)(b).
          </p>
          <p>
            Where records were partially disclosed, 17&nbsp;extensions were
            taken under&nbsp;9(1)(a), 21&nbsp;extensions were taken
            under&nbsp;9(1)(b) and 18&nbsp;extensions were taken
            under&nbsp;9(1)(c).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the twelve&nbsp;cases where the request was abandoned
            six&nbsp;extensions were taken under&nbsp;9(1)(a),
            two&nbsp;extensions under&nbsp;9(1)(b) and four&nbsp;extensions
            under&nbsp;9(1)(c).
          </p>
          <h4>Length of extensions</h4>
          <p>
            In 24&nbsp;cases where an extension was taken under&nbsp;9(1)(a),
            13&nbsp;requests required an extension of 30&nbsp;days or less,
            nine&nbsp;requests required an extension of 31 &ndash; 60&nbsp;days
            and two requests required an extension of 61 to 120&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 24&nbsp;cases where an extension was taken under&nbsp;9(1)(b), 10
            required an extension of 30&nbsp;days or less and 14 required an
            extension of 31 &ndash; 60&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 22&nbsp;cases where an extension was taken under&nbsp;9(1)(c), 13
            required an extension of 30&nbsp;days or less and 9 required an
            extension of 31 &ndash; 60&nbsp;days.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sv4">PART&nbsp;4 &ndash; Fees</h3>
          <p>
            Over the reporting period, the Board collected $490 in application
            fees for 98&nbsp;requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board waived or refunded $60 in application fees for
            12&nbsp;requests and $150 in search fees for two&nbsp;requests for a
            total of $210 for 14&nbsp;requests. In some cases, fees were waived
            as it was deemed to be in the public interest; in others cases the
            fees were waived to avoid hardship to the requester.

            and organizations
          </h3>
          <p>
            The interdepartmental nature of information in many records under
            the control of the National Energy Board continues to necessitate
            external consultations. For the purposes of Part&nbsp;5 of this
            report, other government institutions are defined as other
            institutions subject to the Access to Information Act. Other
            organizations include the governments of the provinces, territories
            and municipalities and of other countries.

            During the reporting period, the Board received
            36&nbsp;consultations from other government institutions resulting
            in the requirement to review 2020&nbsp;pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consultation volumes are a factor in the NEB’s workload, as their
            processing can require resources at a level similar to that of

            authority to respond to formal access to information requests. Costs
            do not include those that were incurred by other areas of the
            institution, including Offices of Primary Interest and Legal
            Services. The total cost for resources related to the Access to
            Information Act over the reporting period was $257,310.

          <p>
            The Board spent $34,414 on goods and services related to the
            administration of the Access to Information Act. Of that amount
            $24,277 was spent on professional services contracts and $10,137 was

          <h3>Training for ATIP Analysts</h3>
          <p>
            During the reporting period, ATIP staff participated in the
            following events and training sessions:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Yvon&nbsp;Gauthier Info-Training: 3 to 6 September 2013</strong
            ><br />
            Yvon&nbsp;Gauthier provides a complete selection of training courses
            designed to increase knowledge and awareness of Access to
            Information and Privacy issues and legislation. During the reporting
            period, 3 members of the ATIP team attended the following three
            sessions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus on Privacy:</strong> What is “personal information”
              and what are the restrictions around its collection, use and
              dissemination?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Privacy Management Framework:</strong> A Privacy
              Management Framework outlines the structure for reducing privacy
              threats and vulnerabilities. Establishing a strengthened privacy
              framework requires a situational analysis of existing governance,
              procedures, training, and technology.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Info-Source:</strong> An inventory of the personal
              information that is collected, used or disclosed by the NEB to
              ensure that all particular personal information banks have been
              registered, are up-to-date and reflect the requirements of the law
              and Treasury Board Secretariat Policies and Directives.
            </li>
          </ul>

              >Canadian Access and Privacy Association (CAPA): 2&nbsp;December
              2013</strong
            ><br />
            CAPA is a non-profit incorporated organization established in 1987
            for the purpose of furthering the knowledge and expertise of its
            members in the legal and practical aspects of access to information
            and the protection of privacy. This year, one member of the ATIP
            team attended the Annual Conference in Ottawa featuring:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keynote speeches from Nancy Belanger, General Counsel, Office of
              the Information Commissioner of Canada and from Chantal Bernier,
              the Assistant Privacy Commissioner of Canada;
            </li>
            <li>
              Information on privacy-enabling innovation and new technologies;
            </li>
            <li>
              A summary of important court decisions from the past year on
              access and privacy issues; and
            </li>
            <li>Breach notification policies and procedures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ATIP staff also participated in informal training on AccessPro
            software (Privasoft) Case Management and Redaction for both the
            Administrator and End-User. ATIP staff participated by
            teleconference in courses offered by the Treasury Board of Canada
            Secretariat regarding Access to Information and Privacy, Personal
            Information Banks, Info Source and Parliamentary Reporting
            Requirements.
          </p>
          <h3>Training for National Energy Board Staff</h3>
          <p>
            The NEB promotes access to information imperatives in face-to-face
            meetings, presentations, special events, learning products, on the
            Intranet and through its training program. It fosters responsible
            working relationships with clients and operates under clearly
            defined timelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board continues to deliver general training to raise employees’
            awareness of their responsibilities under the Privacy Act and
            specialized training to respond to client’s needs. The ATIP Office
            provided general training on the provisions of the Access to
            Information Act and the Privacy Act and their impact on Board
            programs and initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            ATIP staff also participated in orientation sessions where
            information was provided to 34&nbsp;new Board employees regarding
            obligations under both Acts.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the reporting period, Yvon&nbsp;Gauthier Info-Training
            provided one full-day intensive training session for designated
            Board staff, two half-day sessions were available for all NEB staff
            and one half-day session with a focus on Privacy;
            34&nbsp;participants registered in these sessions. NEB staff also
            participated in a specialized session in order to assist the Board
            in developing a strategy to determine the areas in which the Board
            collects, retains, uses and discloses personal information that may
            require additional Privacy Impact Assessments to be undertaken or
            revised Personal Information Banks and/or Classes of Personal
            Information and a workshop on exemptions and the exercise of
            discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to Information and Privacy Training is mandatory at the
            National Energy Board. The training is an ongoing initiative that
            will be carried on during the 2014-2015 fiscal year and reported
            upon at a later date.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the Board’s Information and Document Services Team
            delivered sessions with colleagues in Records Management and
            Security Management highlighting horizontal linkages between ATIP,
            Security and Records Management, and our electronic corporate
            records repository (RDIMS). Employees who attend these sessions
            develop a complete awareness of their responsibilities and are more
            able to responsibly handle information at the National Energy Board.

          <h2 id="svii">VII. New or revised policies and guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB did not roll out any policies, procedures, and guidelines
            related to access to information during 2013-2014 but continued to
            build on and improve its existing procedures. The majority of the
            Board’s work with respect to policies and guidelines during the
            reporting period were focused on privacy and the development and
            implementation of a Privacy Management Framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB complies with the Directive on the Administration of the
            Access to Information Act and all other related Treasury Board
            Secretariat policies, guidelines, and procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the reporting period, the Board developed the following new
            documents related to the implementation of privacy legislation and a
            privacy culture at the Board:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Web Site Privacy Policy</li>
            <li>
              Options for Structural Design of a Privacy Management Framework
            </li>
            <li>Breeches and Incidents Policy</li>
            <li>Short Privacy Breeches and Incidents Procedure</li>
            <li>Comprehensive Privacy Breeches and Incidents Procedure</li>
            <li>Privacy Impact Assessment Policy</li>
            <li>Procedure for the Conduct of Privacy Impact Assessments</li>
            <li>
              Privacy Policy and Guidelines for the Collection, Creation,
              Management and Handling of Personal Information
            </li>
            <li>The Privacy Concept</li>
            <li>Creating Meaningful and Privacy Compliant Records</li>
            <li>Privacy and the Management of Human Resources</li>
            <li>Privacy and Communications</li>
            <li>Privacy and Contracting</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The NEB also developed a Compliance Obligations Report and an
            Assessment of Evident Collections of Personal Information.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sviii">VIII. Informal Treatment of Access Requests</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB receives requests for information that can be answered
            without citing the Access to Information Act but keeping within the
            spirit of the legislation. No five dollar application fee is
            required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Requests are treated informally when the information requested is
            mostly in the public domain or can be disclosed for other reasons.
            Twenty-nine&nbsp;access-related requests were processed through
            informal means in 2013-2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any copy of a release package from a previously completed request
            under the Act, as listed on the NEB’s Completed Access to
            Information Requests web page, is captured as an informal access
            request. In 2013-2014, 71 such requests were processed.

          <h2 id="six">IX. Info Source</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB now self-publishes the Info Source chapter which continues
            to accurately reflect the contents of the records created to support
            the activities of the NEB and to be aligned with the Program
            Activity Architecture.

          <h2 id="sx">X. Complaints / Investigations</h2>
          <p>
            Through the 2013-2014 reporting period, the Office of the
            Information Commissioner notified the NEB of one complaint which was
            resolved to the satisfaction of the requester. Another complaint
            that the NEB received in 2011-2012 but which was carried over to
            last fiscal year was also resolved. In that instance, the complaint
            was deemed well-founded and was made with respect to fees charged by
            the Board which have since been waived.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sxi">XI. Duty to Assist</h2>
          <p>
            We continue to make every effort to fulfill our duty to assist
            requesters. Here are some examples of how we put this duty into
            action in 2013−2014:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When extensions were necessary, we provided interim releases.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the wording of applications under the Act could have resulted
              in limited disclosure, or we were aware of additional records of
              interest, we notified the requester and gave them the option to
              modify their applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              When consultations were required, we adhered to the shortest
              timeframes possible in responding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where requested records were publically available and therefore
              excluded, we provided requesters with a copy of the publically
              available information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div

          <h2 id="sxii">XII. Enhancing Support and Sustaining Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            The NEB continues to improve the timeliness, efficiency and accuracy
            of responses to Access to Information requests. There was also
            enhanced engagement of senior management through weekly meetings and
            reporting.
          </p>
          <p>This year, the NEB:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Eliminated the backlog of requests from previous years that were
              not yet closed;
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved its proactive disclosures to increase information
              available to the public, thereby reducing the need to file formal
              access to information requests;
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved negotiations with requesters to more clearly understand
              the requests, clarify scope and provide requesters with the
              information they seek;
            </li>
            <li>
              Continued to implement a structured and Board–wide ATIP awareness
              program to ensure that staff and senior officials understand their
              roles and responsibilities regarding ATIP; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked collaboratively with consultants who have expertise in ATIP
              and business processes to assist with the development and
              implementation of a Privacy Management Framework.

<h2 id="s1">1.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>The National Energy Board (Board) strives to promote an efficient pipeline transportation system, where the services that shippers receive from pipeline companies meet shippers’ needs. Towards this end, the Board examines various indicators of how well Canadian energy and transportation markets are working.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Board conducted its seventh Pipeline Services Survey (Survey). The Survey was last conducted in 2011. The Survey is a means to obtain direct feedback from the shippers of NEB-regulated pipeline companies on the quality of service provided by those pipelines and on the Board’s processes with respect to tolls and tariffs. The Board also considers the survey results as an input when deciding which pipeline companies to audit as part of its financial regulatory audit program and in focusing the audit objectives and scope. The Board’s objective is to facilitate continual improvement in pipeline services and the 2016 Survey is in keeping with this objective.</p>
<p>To conduct this year’s Survey, the Board used a web-based survey tool, which was sent to shippers directly via e-mail. For each Survey received, shippers were asked to complete one response which reflects their company’s corporate views on the services provided by the pipeline being surveyed and on the Board’s processes.</p>
<p>This Report is a summary of the results in aggregate for all the companies surveyed. The aggregate results include the industry average and distribution of responses for each question in the Survey and, where appropriate, a summary of major themes. In addition, the Board will provide each pipeline company and its shippers with detailed company-specific results including the pipeline company’s average rating and distribution of responses for each question as well as the verbatim comments received from shippers, without the names of the respondents attributed.</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h2 id="s2">2.0 Surveys Issued and Response Rate</h2>
<p>Pipeline companies were asked to provide the Board with the names of those shippers active on their systems. The Board then sent each one of those shippers the Survey.</p>
<p>The Survey was sent to 375 more shippers this year than in 2011 due to the inclusion of three additional companies (Enbridge Bakken, Enbridge Southern Lights and TransCanada Keystone) and the fact that the shipper lists for a few companies had grown substantially. These expanded shipper lists seem to indicate that they included shippers that were not necessarily “active”. Active shippers are those that deal with the pipeline on a regular basis and could respond to the questions in the Survey.</p>
<p>The overall response rate was approximately twenty-two&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (22%), down slightly from the 2011 rate of twenty-three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (23%).</p>

<h2 id="s3">3.0 Comparison of Pipeline Services Aggregate Survey Results for 2011 and 2016 </h2>
<p>As shown on the chart below, satisfaction with services on NEB-regulated pipelines has not changed much since the last survey in 2011. The industry average on most questions was up slightly. The questions on satisfaction with the provision of commercial information and whether the current settlement or tariff arrangements are working well were up the highest, with increases of 4.7 and 4.6&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent respectively. Shippers’ satisfaction with the degree to which pipeline companies demonstrate an attitude of continuous improvement was down 3.8&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. Satisfaction with NEB processes to resolve disputes was down 1.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent and satisfaction with the physical reliability of pipeline operations was down 0.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</p>
<p>The questions on satisfaction with the menu of transportation services and with the information received about abandonment funding were new this year. Therefore, there is no comparable rating from the 2011 Survey.</p>

<p>This section summarizes the aggregate results for all of the pipelines for each question in the Survey related to pipeline services. The charts below show the distribution of responses and the industry averages.</p>
<p>For the majority of the questions on satisfaction with pipeline services, respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with the services they receive on a scale of 1 to 5, where:</p>
<div class="mrgn-lft-lg">
<ol class="list-unstyled mrgn-lft-lg">
<li>1 indicates “Very dissatisfied”,</li>

<li>5 indicates “Very satisfied”.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 class="list-unstyled "><em>Questions and Responses</em></h3>
<h4>1. How satisfied are you with the physical reliability of the pipeline company’s operations?</h4>
<p>Satisfaction with the physical reliability of pipeline operations decreased very slightly from the 2011 Survey from 3.76 to 3.74. Sixty eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (68%) of shippers gave their pipelines a rating of Satisfied (4) or Very satisfied (5). Some shippers expressed concerns with outages due to planned maintenance for integrity work.</p>

<h4>3. How satisfied are you with the timeliness and accuracy of the pipeline company’s invoices and statements?</h4>
<p>The satisfaction rating for this question increased from 3.90 in 2011 to 3.99 this year. Seventy-five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (75%) of the shippers gave their pipelines a rating of Satisfied (4) or Very satisfied (5). Shippers generally found invoices and statements to be accurate and issued in a timely manner; however, shippers on a few pipelines noted that their invoices often needed revisions and they would like to receive them a bit earlier.</p><div class="col-md-2 "></div>

<h4>4. How satisfied are you with the timeliness and usefulness of operations information (outages, available capacity, scheduled maintenance, flows, etc.) provided by the pipeline company?</h4>
<p>This question showed a slight increase in satisfaction from 3.43 in 2011 to 3.48 this year. The comments on this question indicated that some companies provide timely and effective information on outages and scheduled maintenance, while others provide information that is not timely or lacks sufficient detail. Fifty-one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (51%) of shippers gave their pipelines a rating of Satisfied (4) or Very satisfied (5).</p>

<h4>5. How satisfied are you with the timeliness and usefulness of commercial information (tolls, service changes, new services, contract information, etc) provided by the pipeline company?</h4>
<p>Shippers indicated an increase in satisfaction with the timeliness and usefulness of commercial information. The satisfaction rating increased from 3.43 in 2011 to 3.59 this year. Shippers for a number of pipelines indicated that they receive timely and useful information. A few shippers noted that more timely communication of information on service changes and tolls would be helpful. Fifty-eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (58%) of the shippers gave their pipelines a rating of Satisfied (4) or Very satisfied (5).</p>

<h4>6. The Board defines continuous improvement as a pipeline taking the initiative to make improvements by adding new or modifying existing services and systems based on the feedback and requests from shippers. With this definition in mind, how satisfied are you with the degree to which the pipeline company demonstrates an attitude of continuous improvement and innovation?</h4>
<p>Shippers indicated a decrease in satisfaction this year compared to 2011 for this question. The rating decreased to 3.06 from 3.18 in 2011. Feedback from shippers was mixed, with some indicating that their pipelines are willing to work with shippers to improve processes and services, while other pipelines stick to their traditional way of doing business and are unwilling to compromise on key shipper issues. Thirty-seven&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (37%) of the shippers gave their pipelines a rating of Satisfied (4) or Very satisfied (5).</p>

<h4>17. What three areas would need to improve the most for this pipeline company to receive a higher overall customer rating from your company?</h4>
<p>This question provided shippers with an opportunity to list the things that their particular pipeline company could do better. Some commonly mentioned areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage costs better to keep tolls from increasing;</li>
<li>More timely and accurate information on operations;</li>
<li>More flexibility, transparency and communication;</li>
<li>More genuine collaboration;</li>

<h4>18. When toll and tariff matters are not resolved through settlement, how satisfied are you with the Board’s processes to resolve disputes?</h4>
<p>Shipper satisfaction with the Board’s processes decreased from 3.31 in 2011 to 3.27 this year. While some shippers stated that the Board’s hearing process is fair, others noted that participation in the Board’s processes is cost and time prohibitive. A few shippers mentioned that the Board should encourage alternatives to litigation to resolve disputes, such as mediation or alternative dispute resolution. Some shippers raised a concern that they are required to pay the regulatory costs of the pipelines as well as their own. Forty-one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (41%) of the shippers gave the Board a rating of Satisfied (4) or Very satisfied (5), while forty-one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (41%) remained neutral.</p>

<h2 id="s5">5.0 Conclusions</h2>
<h3 class="list-unstyled "><em>Feedback on Pipeline Services</em></h3>
<p>Even though there was a five&nbsp;year gap between conducting the Pipeline Services Survey, the results from the 2016 Survey are very consistent with the 2011 Survey results. Shippers continue to be reasonably satisfied overall with the services provided by pipeline companies.</p>
<p>  The three areas with the highest scores in this year’s Survey are again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timeliness and accuracy of invoices and statements;</li>
<li>Physical reliability of pipeline operations; and</li>
<li>Quality of transactional systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three areas with the lowest scores in this year’s Survey are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipeline working to keep tolls as low as reasonably possible;</li>
<li>Demonstrating an attitude of continuous improvement; and</li>
<li>Collaborative processes (negotiations or task force meetings).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="list-unstyled "><em>Feedback on the Board</em></h3>
<p>The 2016 Survey indicated that shipper satisfaction with the Board’s processes to resolve disputes has decreased slightly from 2011. A variety of suggestions were made to improve processes, which are listed under question 19 above. Most of these suggestions fall under the areas of greater consultation with shippers and end-users, and more streamlined and simplified NEB processes when the parties are not able to negotiate a solution. These two areas are aligned with the Board’s strategic priorities of “Engage with Canadians” and “Lead Regulatory Excellence”. Therefore, the Board will look for ways it can implement these suggestions from shippers into its processes for determining tolls and tariffs going forward.</p>

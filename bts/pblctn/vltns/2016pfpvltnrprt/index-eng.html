          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            This evaluation report presents the findings, conclusions and
            recommendations of the National Energy Board’s (NEB, Board)
            Participant Funding Program (PFP or “the program”) evaluation. The
            evaluation examines the program’s relevance, effectiveness
            (performance), efficiency and economy for the period of June 2010 to
            June 2015 during which the initial Terms and Conditions (2010) of
            the PFP were applicable. The evaluation is mandatory and meets the
            requirements of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em

            every five&nbsp;years. The evaluation was undertaken between
            November 2014 and September 2015 and focused on the achievement of
            immediate and intermediate outcomes as well as program design and
            implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This evaluation analyzes data from the past five&nbsp;years of the
            PFP, obtains feedback from internal and external stakeholders and
            examines relevant documentation in order to assess outcomes achieved
            as well as challenges and opportunities in program implementation.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Findings</h3>
          <h4><em>Relevance</em></h4>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program is aligned with the roles,
            responsibilities and priorities of the federal government as well as
            the mandate and priorities of the Board. There is a continuing need
            for PFP as a result of the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> (NEB
            Act) and<em> Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em>
            (CEAA&nbsp;2012). Stakeholders also agree that the funding program
            is needed though opinions were divided on whether the program should
            maintain its current budget for contributions given its purpose of
            being a supportive yet modest funding program or whether it should
            establish an increased level of participant funding overall for the
            program, therefore changing its purpose.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Achievement of Outcomes</em></h4>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program demonstrates that it takes steps to
            make the program accessible to potential applicants and it promotes
            fairness and transparency through a structured application process
            and publically reporting on the results of funding opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the PFP mainly uses a section of the NEB website to
            communicate information about the program such as current funding
            opportunities and funding reports. The NEB also creates and
            disseminates other public information materials to target
            applicants, however some updates are required. Engagement sessions
            conducted by other staff with Aboriginal groups or open houses are
            also used to promote the program as well as a newspaper campaign to
            launch each funding opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders generally support the objectives of the PFP
            and have the information they need in their work. External
            stakeholders agree that contribution awards help to off-set the cost
            of participating in hearing. Stakeholders generally agree that the
            program is accessible and fair, but some have found that the funding
            process could be adjusted to allow more time to prepare for a
            hearing. As well applicants that do not receive a funding award
            suggest that a more comprehensive reason should be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP determines funding for contributions on a project-by-project
            basis based on information such as the size and location of the
            project, the number of Aboriginal groups in the area, available
            resources and the funding level set for similar projects in the
            past. Based on data from the program and finance, the budget for
            contributions each fiscal year has been adequate to make payments to
            recipients and the PFP re-profiles the balance of unused
            contributions to the next fiscal year when the demand for payments
            is anticipated. The program demonstrates that it takes action to
            substantially adjust the hearing envelope for hearings that involve
            more affected people, greater complexity and a larger project scope
            than past hearings. This requires a formal request for additional
            funds through the Treasury Board Secretariat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most recipients of participant funding awards participate in the
            hearing and access their funding. The PFP has tried different
            methods to determine whether the program supports participation in a
            hearing such as feedback surveys within applications and invoices as
            well as having a socio-economic specialist from the Applications
            Business Unit summarize the nature and level of participation of
            funded applicants. These methods, though, have not been consistent
            and stakeholders suggest that determining adequate levels of
            participation is challenging because it is subjective. There is an
            opportunity to consistently compile and analyze data to determine
            trends in PFP related hearings and to support assessment of PFP
            outcomes.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Design and Implementation</em></h4>
          <p>
            The program has developed tools as well as a process map to guide
            program processes as well as templates and informational material
            for the public. Considerable efforts have been made at the
            five&nbsp;year mark of the program by current staff to gradually
            document and update key program material and in light of the new PFP
            Terms and Conditions (2015). Additional work is needed to create a
            new logic model and corresponding performance framework with
            outcomes that are measurable. This will help the program to position
            itself for consistent data collection and allow it to analyze and
            update the program as required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past five&nbsp;years the program’s approach has been to set
            a funding envelope and then either approve awards following the
            application deadline or review applications individually or in
            batches as they come in. Firm deadlines have established greater
            certainty in the process for applicants and program staff whereas
            processing applications as they are submitted may have helped to
            spread out the workload. More recently the PFP has introduced
            funding caps for individuals or groups in order to set modest
            expectations for applicants in their funding request. While this
            approach may help to manage the workload of the program, comments
            from internal stakeholders, including members of the funding review
            committee, state that over the past five&nbsp;years, when reviewing
            applications on a rolling basis without knowing the full demand for
            the particular funding opportunity makes it more challenging to
            allocate limited dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is variation in the timing of PFP in relation to other key
            hearing activities and stakeholders suggest that timelines and the
            approach to the Application to Participate (ATP) in relation to the
            Application for Funding should be examined in order to make
            improvements to the timeliness and accessibility of the PFP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, recipients of awards must be granted intervenor status
            through the Application to Participate process, which sometimes
            occurs before, during or after the PFP process. While the newer
            application form requests the applicant to state whether they
            already know they are an intervenor, the PFP’s process map does not
            include the steps to be taken by staff in confirming the
            participation status of a given applicant. This is important given
            that funding is contingent on the participation level granted by the
            Board.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Efficiency and Economy</em></h4>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program appears to be improving the
            efficiency of program delivery given the working context and works
            towards solutions to continuously improve. For example the program
            updated its delegated financial signing authority matrix to improve
            the timing of some of its activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearings overlap fiscal years and personnel and O&amp;M costs may be
            incurred in a different year than when the awards are offered,
            signed or paid. Thus assessing whether the program used its
            resources economically for each funding process would be limited in
            its usefulness when analyzing whether the program operates in an
            economical manner. From the data though, the cost of the Funding
            Review Committee (FRC) makes up most of the operating and
            maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditures and individual hours and billing
            are variable but overall the cost of a FRC is minimal
            (between&nbsp;0.1% and&nbsp;5%) when compared to the total funding
            requested or awarded per funding opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP is a small program within the Applications Business Unit and
            operates on its own budget (fiscal year) set in 2010 for direct
            costs (contributions) and indirect costs (personnel and operating
            and maintenance). It is supported by two full time staff - one
            funded by the PFP personnel budget - the other through the
            Applications Business Unit. The need for the additional full-time
            equivalent (FTE) resource was required to allow the program to
            manage the variable workload. Thus the original budget has not been
            adequate to support the required staff to deliver the program. As
            well, although the program has budgeted its indirect costs to total
            program costs within its target of 13%, fewer contribution payments
            made then budgeted per fiscal year together with an extra FTE makes
            it appear that the actual program administration costs are a large
            share of the program’s overall budget.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the nature of the program, the program manager has had to
            manage the budget and cash flow by both fiscal year and project.
            Recent changes to the Terms and Conditions (June 2015) of the
            program expand its scope and flexibility. For example the Funding
            Review Committee is no longer mandatory and other types of hearings
            will also be required to offer funding. Work, though, remains to
            clarify and implement these particular changes introduced by the
            Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data and analysis related to advertising PFP in newspapers (which is
            not paid for by the PFP budget) was also found to be missing for the
            past five&nbsp;years. The evaluation also noted that assessing the
            level of effort for the program by quantifying the hours of work by
            staff in relation to the program is at best an estimate, since staff
            do not accurately record their hours of work. Recording work related
            to the PFP as accurately as possible is important so that the
            program can assess the level of effort involved on operating the
            program and its related activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program has not had a useful electronic tool to manage
            information on each funding opportunity, for each applicant and
            overall data thus creating an unnecessary administrative burden. The
            records management system (RDIMS) is not the right fit for a
            contributions program. As a result, the program has some incomplete
            and inaccurate records and data. This has an effect on the ability
            to analyze information and to contribute to performance management.
            The program has already identified this risk and has started to work
            on a new IM/IT solution but there is still further work and time
            required for it to be implemented.
          </p>
          <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="text-primary lead ">1</span> It is recommended that in
            response to the new Terms and Conditions (June 2015), a logic model
            should be developed and corresponding performance measures that are
            SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely).
            Performance measures should be consistently tracked and reported.
            The program should also develop an approach to monitoring
            contribution agreements for compliance with terms and conditions in
            the agreement (e.g. the recipient’s deliverables).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-primary lead ">2</span> It is recommended that the
            staff involved in the PFP and Hearings work together to assess the
            hearing process timelines and key deliverables in order to realize
            efficiencies in the process and to allow for better planning of PFP
            and ATP. Integration of timelines for the PFP and ATP within the
            hearing process to the extent possible as well as consistency in the
            timing of key activities would help to ensure a fair, timely,
            accessible and transparent funding program.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-primary lead ">3</span> It is recommended that the
            PFP work with other business areas (e.g. Applications,
            Communications and Finance) on a continuous basis to articulate
            their shared processes and to update and maintain internal and
            external documentation related to PFP in order to ensure that the
            program is accessible and communicated consistently both internally
            to staff and to the public. Good communication and coordination of
            information is important since the program requires assistance and
            advice from other internal services at the NEB. As well, frequent
            changes to the program design demands clear and consistent
            information to staff and the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-primary lead ">4</span> It is recommended that the
            PFP assess its responsibility for budgeting and managing its
            communications costs and examine its approach for effectiveness in
            reaching eligible participant groups. Communications (including
            advertising) are an indirect cost to operating the program and it is
            important to assess various approaches to ensure that the resources
            are adequate and are used in a way that adds value and contributes
            to achieving program objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-primary lead ">5</span> It is recommended that the
            PFP document its approach for determining its use of an external
            FRC. This guideline should have clear rules to ensure the
            predictability, transparency and fairness of the program and its
            process for reviewing applications and recommending awards. In
            developing an approach, the program could assess the level of effort
            and cost to coordinate a Funding Review Committee and determine the
            situations where it might be economical to use an FRC.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-primary lead ">6</span> It is recommended that the
            program make further improvements to efficiencies in its process
            overall by implementing a unique and centralized system to collect,
            analyze and report information related to specific projects and the
            program overall. Such a system could also improve workflow and
            control of the process and program documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="text-primary lead ">7</span> It is recommended that the
            Participant Funding Program use available data to track and monitor
            the level of contributions required as well as indirect costs
            (including all roles that are critical to operating the program).
            Tracking and monitoring all direct and indirect costs will allow the
            program to better assess its budgetary needs over time.

          <p>
            This is the first evaluation of the Participant Funding Program at
            the Board and presents several findings, conclusions and
            recommendations. The evaluation examined the program’s relevance,
            effectiveness (performance), efficiency and economy during the
            period June 2010 to June 2015. Given that the program is still in
            its early years, the focus of the evaluation was on the achievement
            of immediate and intermediate outcomes. As well, the evaluation
            responds to the request from PFP management to assess whether
            internal stakeholders are aligned with PFP objectives and have the
            information they need. The evaluation was substantially carried out
            between November 2014 and September 2015.

          <h3 id="s1_2">1.2 Program Background</h3>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board is an independent federal, quasi-judicial
            regulator established in 1959 to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and economic efficiency in the Canadian
            public interest within the mandate set by Parliament for the
            regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade. Its main
            responsibilities are established in the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em>. Certain pipeline project
            applications to the Board trigger a public hearing. The NEB issues a
            Hearing Order providing details about the hearing process and how
            persons who are directly affected or who have relevant information
            or expertise may apply to participate. Participants are given the
            opportunity to make their case by submitting evidence on the hearing
            record and to appear at the oral portion of the hearing in order to
            provide their views and evidence. This informs the decision-making
            about the proposed project under review. The final decision whether
            or not to approve the application for a major pipeline project is
            made by the federal government (Governor in Council) based on the
            recommendation from the Board.<sup id="fn4-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn4"

          <p>
            The Board established the PFP in 2010 to facilitate the
            participation of the public in hearings with an oral component held
            under the <em>National Energy Board Act</em

              ></sup
            >. The initial Terms and Conditions were approved by the Treasury
            Board Secretariat (TBS) on 24&nbsp;June 2010 and the program was
            launched in September 2010. The Terms and Conditions of the program
            were recently modified on 2&nbsp;June 2015.

            carried out at the NEB to determine who may participate in a hearing
            and how. Intervenors may file written evidence, ask questions and
            provide final arguments.<sup id="fn8-rf"

          <h4>1.2.1 History and context</h4>
          <p>
            The National Energy Board officially launched its Participant
            Funding Program in late 2010; however the funding program was
            contemplated much earlier. A request from the Minister of Natural
            Resources Canada in late 1995 to review the best method to introduce
            a funding program resulted in a report a few months later and
            presented some options to consider under the legislative framework
            at that time.<sup id="fn9-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn9"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>9</a
              ></sup
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program, modeled on CEEA’s program, had the
            goal of providing a modest level of funding to facilitate
            participation of intervenors in an oral hearing. It is not intended
            to cover all the costs of participation and the NEB encourages
            eligible recipients to collaborate with others and seek other
            additional sources of funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new Terms and Conditions approved in June&nbsp;2, 2015 introduce
            some key changes to the scope of the program including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              expanding the eligibility of hearings to include environmental
              assessments of designated projects (as defined by CEAA&nbsp;2012)
              for which the Board is the responsible authority as well as
              written facilities hearings;
            </li>
            <li>the Funding Review Committee will be optional; and</li>
            <li>
              applicants have to demonstrate that they plan to provide
              value-added information that contributes to a better understanding
              of the potential impacts of a project.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The PFP has also introduced recent changes in the design and
            delivery of the program such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the program no longer requires recipient costs to be classified by
              a priority level
            </li>
            <li>
              eligible costs will be reimbursed from the date the company files
              its project application with the NEB rather than the effective
              date of the contribution agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              expected deliverables from the recipient are listed in the
              contribution agreement
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <a href="#nnx2">Annex&nbsp;2</a> also summarizes the history of PFP
            and some key actions and changes related to the program.
          </p>
          <h4>1.2.2 Program delivery</h4>
          <p>
            When the program received approval in 2010, it first operated out of
            the Office of the Secretary of the Board in order to operate
            arms-length from regulatory processes. There were a few projects in
            the first&nbsp;years of the program with few applicants for funding;
            however this changed in 2012 with the Enbridge Line&nbsp;9B project
            application. Around the same time, due to the increasing complexity
            of hearings and the introduction of time limits, the NEB decided to
            situate the PFP and its staff within the Applications Business Unit.
            This was to allow the program staff and those responsible for
            managing the hearing process to work together to manage their
            respective process timelines. The program maintains its independence
            from the project application review process, by working exclusively
            with Hearing Management on process and with engagement staff to
            provide information about PFP that can be shared with the public.
            The PFP is the only transfer payment program administered by the
            Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full-time manager and coordinator manage the PFP. A small Steering
            Committee of four staff, comprised of senior NEB staff and the PFP
            Manager, provides strategic and technical advice to the program and
            its delivery. Other staff (e.g. legal counsel) is invited as
            required to join the meetings and certain discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Steering Committee, recommends a funding envelope for each
            project based on certain criteria (<a href="#t1">Table&nbsp;1</a>).
            In the past, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) would approve the
            funding envelope; however with updates to delegated signing
            authority in 2012 and 2015, the leader of the Applications Business
            Unit is now responsible for this role. Once the funding envelope is
            approved, it is announced publically.

            The PFP Manager establishes a Funding Review Committee (FRC) by
            drawing from the pool of external members approved by the Executive
            Vice-President, Regulatory. The Committee usually consists of at
            least three people, including the PFP Manager and at least one
            person not connected to government. Committee members must be
            independent, which means they must have no interest or financial
            stake in the proposed project. The FRC reviews and evaluates the
            merit of each application and prepares a report recommending how
            funding should be allocated. They invoice their time to the program
            and are all paid the same per diem (pro-rated per hour).
          </p>
          <p>
            While the authority for PFP awards resides with the Executive
            Vice-President, Regulatory, most funding recommendation memos were
            addressed to the Chief Operating Officer when approving awards. PFP
            processes and templates have since been updated to align with the
            revised Terms and Conditions and Financial Delegation Matrix
            approved in June 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, the PFP required applicants to prioritize costs by high,
            medium and low in accordance with a chart provided in the PFP
            Funding Guide<sup id="fn11-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn11"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>11</a
              ></sup
            >. For example legal, expert and travel costs were given high
            priority whereas translating information was considered medium
            priority. High priority costs were to be paid first followed by
            medium and low if there were funds remaining from the applicant’s
            award. In December 2014 the program updated its Funding Guide1<sup
              id="fn12-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn12"
                ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>12</a
              ></sup
            >
            and removed the distinction between priority costs. Instead it
            introduced funding maximums for each type of eligible recipient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contribution Agreements are sent to applicants that receive an
            award. For the last five&nbsp;years, the Contribution Agreement only
            allowed reimbursement of expenses incurred after the agreement was
            signed by both the recipient and the NEB’s Vice President,
            Applications (now changed to the Director accountable for the PFP).
            In 2015, the Contribution Agreement template was revised to allow
            reimbursement of eligible costs incurred from the date the company
            files the project application with the Board to the date the hearing
            record closes. This approach ensures that the eligible costs are
            based on the same date for all applicants versus when their
            agreements are signed. As mentioned before, the participant must
            also obtain intervenor status if they haven’t already for the
            contribution agreement to remain valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            To receive payment for eligible expenditures, recipients are
            required to use the claim template provided by the program and
            submit their request, typically within 60&nbsp;days from the date
            the hearing closes. The program assesses the claims and supporting
            documentation for eligibility and then makes a payment request
            through the Finance group at the NEB. The original Terms and
            Conditions of the PFP required the Vice President, Applications to
            certify payments according to the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (FAA). The new Terms and
            Conditions (June 2015) for the program now place this responsibility
            with the PFP Manager. The program indicates that this reduces the
            time to approve payments.

          <h4>1.2.3 Resources</h4>
          <p>
            The PFP currently has an annual budget of just over
            $1.5&nbsp;million, which includes $1.3&nbsp;million of funding set
            aside for contribution payments and the rest for one full-time staff
            member and operating and maintenance costs (O&amp;M). See
            <a href="#t2">Table&nbsp;2</a> for the breakdown. Operating and
            maintenance funding is used for the following: Funding Review
            Committee fees, consulting services, temporary help and training and
            travel for PFP staff.

            The budget for contribution payments in FY&nbsp;2012-13 was planned
            in 2010 at a significantly higher level due to an anticipated
            project and higher level of public participation expected for that
            time; however this particular project application was not submitted,
            thus the program requested and received approval from Treasury Board
            to re-profile the budget for contributions to future years to meet
            the demand for other eligible hearings.

            The expenditures on personnel, as shown in
            <a href="#t4">Table&nbsp;4</a> above, are higher than budgeted since
            2012-13 because it includes both the manager and coordinator
            position. Although the PFP coordinator position is funded by the
            Applications Business Unit, it is considered a necessary role to
            operate the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The budget for indirect costs (<a href="#t2">Table&nbsp;2</a>)
            compared to the overall budget for the program (using the modified
            budget for contributions from <a href="#t3">Table&nbsp;3</a>) shows
            that the program was in line with its target of budgeting 13% of
            indirect costs to overall budget. However, as shown below in
            <a href="#t5">Table&nbsp;5</a>, the actual indirect cost versus
            total actual spending has exceeded the 13% target. This is partially
            due to including the second FTE position in the actual expenditures
            and there were fewer contribution payments than what was budgeted
            for.

            In FY&nbsp;2012-13 the program spent a greater level of its O&amp;M
            budget than previous years in order to advertise for new members to
            its Funding Review Committee. The PFP advertising costs for each
            project, however, are paid by the overall hearing budget and not by
            the program’s budget. <a href="#t6">Table&nbsp;6</a> below provides
            another way to examine contributions, and shows the amounts awarded
            and signed versus paid each fiscal year. This table demonstrates
            that contributions are not always paid in the same year they are
            awarded, thus necessitating a close watch over cash flow by the
            program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of hearings is variable and sometimes take place over
            more than one fiscal year. Overall though, contributions and
            expenditures increased each year since the PFP was introduced.

          <p>
            This evaluation was conducted in accordance with the TBS Policy on
            Evaluation (2009) and addresses the core evaluation questions
            related to relevance and performance, efficiency and economy,
            namely:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Alignment with federal roles and responsibilities;</li>
            <li>Alignment with government priorities;</li>
            <li>The continued need for the program;</li>
            <li>Achievement of expected outcomes; and</li>
            <li>Demonstration of efficiency and economy.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The results of the evaluation will be used by the NEB to inform
            future decisions about program design and to further develop
            direction for performance management.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s2_1">2.1 Evaluation Objectives</h3>
          <p>
            During the planning phase for the evaluation and in consultation
            with the PFP staff, a logic model, evaluation questions and outcome
            measures were defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            A PFP logic model (<a href="#nnx1">Annex&nbsp;1</a>) was developed
            specifically for the PFP Evaluation in consultation with PFP staff
            and the following documents:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Treasury Board Submission approving the NEB PFP Terms and
              Conditions<br />
              (approved June 24, 2010);
            </li>
            <li>NEB PFP Funding Guide (2010 and 2014);</li>
            <li>
              NEB PFP informational material, website, internal process and
              procedures; and
            </li>
            <li>Draft PFP Performance Measurement Framework (2013).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The logic model addresses the original performance measures from the
            Terms and Conditions of the program and the evaluation matrix as
            shown in <a href="#nnx3">Annex&nbsp;3</a> incorporates these as well
            as relevant indicators. Given that this is the first evaluation for
            a program that has existed for only five&nbsp;years, the evaluation
            focuses on immediate and intermediate outcomes from the logic model
            as well as on the program design and implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early July 2015, the NEB Evaluation Committee and the NEB’s Chair
            and CEO endorsed the Terms of Reference and associated evaluation
            questions for the Evaluation of the PFP. These are shown in
            <a href="#t7">Table&nbsp;7</a> below along with a conclusion:

            This evaluation assessed and analyzed program documentation,
            conducted interviews and obtained feedback from internal and
            external stakeholders using systematic questions. Using the program
            and financial data that was available from the NEB, qualitative and
            quantitative analysis was also done.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program manages funding opportunities for hearings that take
            place over one or more years as demonstrated by
            <a href="#t6">Table&nbsp;6</a> above, such that contributions are
            usually paid in another year than when they are awarded. As a
            result, the program manages individual funding opportunities within
            the overall budget set for the program each fiscal year. Program
            staff implemented a process to track and update cash flow by project
            and fiscal year which involves forecasting when contribution funds
            will be paid to ensure that funds will be available when required.
            This evaluation generally takes a project-by-project approach to
            analyze the data for each hearing’s funding opportunity to answer
            several evaluation questions but the personnel and O&amp;M costs are
            analyzed by fiscal year as they are budgeted in this way and not by
            project.

            <strong>Interviews</strong> [27] were conducted either in-person, by
            telephone or via email with the help of an interview guide. Comments
            from interviewees are reported in an aggregate manner with no
            references to specific individuals. Interview notes were analyzed by
            indicator to determine relevant information and key themes. See

          <p>
            Those that had applied for funding under the PFP at least once were
            invited to respond to certain questions and provide their thoughts.
            This survey was contracted out and took place between February and
            March 2015. The response rate was 18% (from a total of
            44&nbsp;groups/individuals).

          <p>
            Those at the NEB who might have relevant knowledge or experience
            with the program were invited to respond to several evaluation
            questions in July 2015 (189&nbsp;staff). The response rate was
            nearly 50%.

            The evaluation used multiple lines of evidence to ensure that
            observations were consistent with the information made available
            through interviews, document review and data analysis. The
            limitations to the evaluation methodology are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Low response rate/feedback from external stakeholders</li>
            <li>
              Accessibility of financial or program data to assess the
              indicators and conclude on the measures for the evaluation.

            >, a report to the Government of Canada, recommended that
            “participant funding must be recognized as an essential element of
            environmental assessment to enable citizens to participate in the

            the Government stated that participant funding programs will be
            established by both the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)
            and the Board “to ensure the timely and meaningful engagement of the
            public, stakeholders and Aboriginal peoples in the review of major
            energy projects”. At the same time responsibility for conducting
            environmental assessments for energy projects was delegated from the
            Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to the Board for projects
            under its area of expertise.

            Outcomes
          </h4>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program is aligned with government
            priorities and the NEB Strategic Outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the NEB’s Program Alignment Architecture (PAA), the PFP program
            falls under the program Energy Regulation and sub-program: Energy
            Regulation Implementation, Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement.
            Since 2013, it includes the statement: “...the NEB actively involves
            those affected by its regulatory decisions through public hearings
            and other engagement activities”.
          </p>
          <p>
            A review of the Reports on Plans and Priorities (RPP) shows that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In FY&nbsp;2006-07, the NEB committed to introducing participant
              funding, acknowledging that hearing participants and landowners
              argued that a lack of support puts them at a disadvantage during
              specific hearings due to the cost of technical experts or lawyers
              to represent them or the cost of taking time to participate. The
              NEB sought to make hearing processes more accessible to a broad
              range of stakeholders.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over the next few years, the NEB reported its progress in its RPPs
              which included work to obtain the authority to directly provide
              funding to qualified public participants. It also stated that a
              key motivator in developing the PFP was to achieve regulatory
              efficiency and effectiveness.<sup id="fn23-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn23"

          </ul>
          <p>
            A review of the Departmental Performance Reports (DPR) shows that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In FY&nbsp;2009-10, the NEB states that implementing a participant
              funding program will support eligible stakeholders in effectively
              engaging in NEB regulatory processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              In FY&nbsp;2010-11, the NEB states that it implemented the PFP to
              enhance the timely, meaningful engagement of the public in oral
              facility hearings.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A performance measurement policy from when PFP was first launched in
            2010, states that the planned result for PFP is the meaningful
            participation of the public in oral hearings to review the impacts
            of proposed projects.
          </p>
          <h4>3.1.3 On-going Need</h4>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            There is demand for funding each time it is announced for a proposed
            project hearing and this demand is met by providing a contribution
            towards eligible costs related to the hearing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feedback from external stakeholders indicates that their
            participation was made possible through the funding. Internal
            stakeholders note that demand for PFP has increased in recent years,
            which suggests there is a continued need for the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program is made available to eligible
            applicants to prepare for and participate in public hearings related
            to the following applications under the NEB Act as found in

            Between 2011 and June 2015, the NEB administered participant funding
            for 10&nbsp;hearings, nine of which have concluded. At the time of
            the evaluation, there were seven other hearings in various stages of
            the PFP process. <a href="#nnx6">Annex&nbsp;6</a> contains a
            detailed list of the project names and companies that applied. For
            the purposes of this evaluation, short-form names for the projects
            are used consistently throughout to illustrate the data and
            analysis. <a href="#t10">Table&nbsp;10</a> below shows that each
            funding envelope has varied over the years, and is generally around
            $200,000 on average (not including Trans Mountain Expansion or
            Energy East).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Program usually awards the full funding envelope for each
            hearing. Early in the program, though, the total request from
            applicants was sometimes below the amount of funding available as
            shown in <a href="#fg1">Figure&nbsp;1</a> below, and after assessing
            the applications the total amount awarded was even lower.
          </p>
          <p>
            When compared to the overall PFP budget of $8,413,619 (<a href="#t2"
              >Table&nbsp;2</a

            >, less than half (approximately 33%) of this has been made
            available in funding envelopes and even less has been awarded.
            Factors affecting the funding envelope include the type and scope of
            the project and the level of interest from the public.

            Unused contribution funds lapse unless they are re-profiled each
            year for another hearing, which is usually the case for the PFP
            since it is a demand-driven program that manages a budget based on
            information that is not necessarily available at the beginning of
            each fiscal year. Two of the indicators identified in the evaluation
            matrix regarding the need for the Program are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Demand for participant funding by the number of applications; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Percentage of funds available for a given project that were
              awarded and used by participants in the hearing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As shown in <a href="#t11">Table&nbsp;11</a> below, the number of
            applicants and awards has varied by project. For all
            10&nbsp;hearings listed in <a href="#t9">Table&nbsp;9</a>, 76% of
            applicants have been awarded funding, and of those, 86% signed their
            contribution agreement. Not including Trans Mountain Expansion
            Project, which is still in the process of making contribution
            payments, of the 38 contribution agreements signed, 87% received
            payment. The majority of applications for funding have come from
            Aboriginal groups; however Line&nbsp;9B and Trans Mountain Expansion
            Projects saw an increase in applications from non-governmental
            organizations/not-for-profits and individuals.

            There are a several reasons why the number of awards is not the same
            as the number of contribution agreements or the number of awards
            paid. Recipients may have declined their agreement by not signing,
            later withdrew from the hearing or failed to send in their invoices
            to the NEB for reimbursement.
          </p>

            In the first few hearings that offered participant funding, those
            applying for funding were likely to receive it. As well these
            applicants tended to be Aboriginal groups. The other types of groups
            attending and participating in the hearings were commonly groups
            that are ineligible for participant funding such as energy industry
            organizations, government groups or for-profit organizations.
            Internal feedback also points to the Aboriginal engagement
            activities where staff directly provided attendees with information
            about the hearing process and availability of participant funding as
            being a potential contributor to the higher number of Aboriginal
            groups making applications for funding.

            On average, the awards have ranged from $1,250 for an individual to
            $550,000 for a group. Usually the awarded funds were accepted by
            recipients though there were 17&nbsp;cases across several hearings
            amounting to $126,450 where the contribution agreement was declined
            or not signed by the recipient, thus voiding the award. This results
            in a lower total dollar value of awards paid out compared to that
            awarded. <a href="#t12">Table&nbsp;12</a> shows the awards and

          <p>
            There is no obvious trend in the number of applications received
            during the period reviewed by the evaluation or in the amounts
            requested or awarded. Recently though, there have been more
            applications for funding; and the funding envelopes have also
            increased to meet anticipated demand. The number of applications for
            funding or interest in participating in the hearing is likely
            influenced by a variety of factors including the nature of the
            project and its location, the information in the project description
            or application and awareness of PFP.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the question “Would you still have been able to
            participate in the NEB hearing without funding from PFP”, most
            respondents stated that would have not been able to participate
            without funding [5/6]. As stated before, caution should be taken
            when interpreting results from external feedback given the low
            response rate to the survey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Responses from internal stakeholders were mixed, with some pointing
            out that funding levels could better match demand, or that
            additional funding is required.

          <h5>3.2.1.1 Alignment with program objectives</h5>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders have the information they need to perform
            their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders indicate that they understand and support the
            objectives of the PFP and believe that participant funding helps to
            remove the financial barrier to participation. They also raise the
            point that it is important for the program to continually manage
            expectations since it has limited funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The majority of internal stakeholders [62/91] providing feedback
            have the information about the program that they need to perform
            their work. They notice that the program has been proactive in
            making recent improvements to internal communication, there are
            updated process documents and information about the program is
            shared. Stakeholders encourage continuous work to formalize internal
            processes for interacting with other areas of the organization
            especially to consistently implement each funding opportunity within
            the hearing process and communicate information to potential
            applicants and participants.
          </p>
          <h5>3.2.1.2 Public awareness</h5>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            The PFP process and funding opportunities are, in general,
            communicated to targeted groups; however there are ways to better
            align internal efforts on communicating accurate, timely and
            consistent information to the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program uses several methods to communicate
            details about the program and funding opportunities to the public
            and Aboriginal groups. Newspaper Ads and the NEB’s website are used
            to launch a funding opportunity. The website also contains further
            information about current projects and their status, application
            deadlines, funding reports, templates and further description about
            the program. There are also quick links to the funding program
            through major project webpages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff that conducts Enhanced Aboriginal Engagement (EAE) through the
            Applications Business Unit, coordinates with the Major Projects
            Management Office (MPMO) at Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to mail
            letters to specific groups (determined to be potentially affected by
            the proposed Project) about a particular project and funding
            opportunity. These letters are usually sent around the same time as
            the PFP news release or shortly after. These engagement activities
            with the Aboriginal groups or Open Houses with the public are also
            ways in which the NEB provides further information about the hearing
            process and participant funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that the program maintain relevant PFP information
            in external publications. For example, in September 2010, the NEB
            published a Guide for Landowners and the Public which summarizes the
            hearing process and provides information about the regulatory life
            cycle, land agreements, right of entry, and the complaints process.
            This guide is available in print or electronically on the NEB
            website. It does not have any information about the participant
            funding program though it is addressed to one of the target
            audiences of the funding program. This could be because the guide
            was introduced around the time that the PFP began and has not been
            updated since.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the NEB issues a Hearing Order, it requires the company to
            serve a copy on certain persons, agencies, Aboriginal groups,
            individuals and landowners. The NEB also requests the company to
            publish the Notice of Hearing in certain publications by a specific
            date. The Notice may also mention the PFP. In the first several
            hearings the application deadline occurred prior to the Hearing
            Order and thus the Hearing Order does not mention the funding
            program. Other more recent Hearings have briefly mentioned the
            availability of participant funding or promise further information
            in subsequent updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the PFP is advertised by newspaper, the program has never
            paid for these Ads through its O&amp;M budget, even though
            ‘communication’ is considered an indirect administrative cost for
            the program. The only advertising paid for through the PFP budget
            was to recruit Funding Review Committee members a few years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feedback from external stakeholders suggest that they hear about
            funding through the NEB website or information session&nbsp;[2/8],
            through public notice&nbsp;[1/8], local media (newspaper, radio, TV)
            [1/8] or a colleague&nbsp;[1/8]. Several internal stakeholders were
            of the opinion that it could be confusing for the public to
            differentiate between the Application to Participate process and the
            Application for Funding, since they are managed by different areas
            of the Board and have separate templates and deadlines but similar
            requirements to justify participation or funding. Internal
            stakeholders that have a role in interacting with Aboriginal groups
            and the public indicate that they have become aware of funding later
            in the process. Staff did not provide any reasons why this may be
            the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other internal stakeholders advised that the program should work
            closely with communications and that the various business units and
            teams should integrate their messages along with the PFP to ensure
            consistency. Other comments were that if engagement staff received
            more training from the program they could better support it by
            responding to these external questions from the public.
          </p>
          <h4>3.2.1 Accessibility</h4>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Program could improve the templates and performance measurement
            and define a systematic approach to collecting feedback and data to
            determine whether it is meeting its various objectives.

            The Treasury Board <em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em> (2008)

            experienced challenges in completing their application for funding
            related to the process and form. A few suggested that it was easy to
            complete [2/8]. Participants state that they found the application
            form repetitive in some areas and they were uncertain how to fit
            their expenses into the funding categories. The majority of
            respondents indicate that they used additional help such as a
            consultant to complete the application [6/8]. Participants also
            mentioned that they are uncertain what criteria are used to judge
            their application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders also provided feedback and suggest that the
            application process needs consistency and streamlining as well as
            clearer guidelines. Others point out that clear operating rules were
            initially lacking for the program, but this has been improving. They
            also note that the program demonstrates that it is flexible and also
            makes adjustments within the constraints of the PFP Terms and
            Conditions and in particular, they note that program documentation
            has improved. Internal stakeholders also thought that while the
            changes the program introduces may be positive, it can be confusing
            for staff and applicants when changes are made to the program while
            carrying out the funding process for a particular hearing and when
            these changes are not readily communicated in advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP has recently updated or created new process documents,
            prepared a detailed process map, application templates, participant
            funding guide and news release template. It also can demonstrate
            that it has developed information that engagement staff can use to
            communicate the program, it has updated the program’s public website
            and it is also working to update and further improve other forms
            such as invoice claims.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some external and internal stakeholders have suggested that ideally
            the Application to Participate (online-based form process) and the
            Application for Funding (paper-based form), could use the same
            online platform to accept applications. This could reduce some of
            the administrative work of duplicating similar information between
            these two applications. It could also be more efficient for
            applicants and staff to have information accessible in one spot.

            requires a documented assessment of a performance measurement

          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP has a Performance Measurement Policy (2010), a Performance
            Measurement Strategy (2010) and a draft Performance Measurement
            Framework (2013). These documents state that the planned result for
            the program is “meaningful participation of the public in oral
            hearings to review the impacts of proposed projects”. Performance
            measures and indicators were also identified for measuring program
            outcomes and efficiency in delivery:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Number of applicants for participant funding per hearing</li>
            <li>% of applications approved for funding.</li>
            <li>
              % of recipients who agree that the funding provided assisted their
              ability to participate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Average&nbsp;# of days from signing of contribution agreements to
              first payment of funds.

              reports to disbursement of next funding tranche.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is evidence that the program has made several attempts to
            compile data in response to these performance measures for the first
            five&nbsp;hearings; however analysis is incomplete, some of the
            calculations are inaccurate or have not been updated. The evaluation
            found that useful data exists in multiple systems but it is time
            consuming to review and analyze. As a result, additional work was
            required to compile information from original sources in order to
            confirm the data and analyze it for this evaluation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP developed a template that requested the socio-economic
            specialist, who was involved in a particular application review, to
            complete following the corresponding hearing. It states that the
            purpose of the template is for the PFP and steering committee to
            understand the amount of involvement by participants so appropriate
            funding allocations can be made.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was created by the program in 2011 and was used for 7 of the
            9&nbsp;completed hearings reviewed in the evaluation. The template
            documents the name of the group or individual, how they
            participated, and whether they applied for and received funding.
            Several staff mentioned that they were unaware of the origins of
            this template, the intent or whether it was a useful exercise. It is
            also unclear whether this template was used to monitor the
            obligations of the recipient against their contribution agreement.

            specifies that if recipient audits are selected as a way to monitor
            transfer payments, then a risk-based plan should be developed for
            such audits. Program staff indicates that a recipient audit has
            never occurred and that recipient audits are not used as a
            monitoring tool because there is no process in place; however the
            standard contribution agreement template signed with each recipient
            states that it is a possibility. There is also a provision in the
            contribution agreement requiring the recipient to maintain relevant
            documentation for a certain period of time (varies from 24 or
            36&nbsp;months). Internal stakeholders stated in interviews that
            they are interested in implementing a recipient audit process, which
            would require a risk profile for each recipient as well as criteria
            for assessing risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program has changed the contribution agreement template several
            times. A review of the contribution agreements from each funding
            opportunity demonstrates that at the beginning of the program, the
            obligations of recipients was limited to the participant agreeing to
            participate in the oral hearing process, using their funding on
            eligible costs identified in the Application approved by the NEB and
            filing their information on the public record. Usually the agreement
            was effective once signed by both the awardee and the NEB. Final
            invoices were due within 60&nbsp;days following the end of the
            hearing. The program used to offer an advance of up to 75%. This
            changed to 50% for a few hearings but is more recently back to 75%.
            The current contribution agreement template articulates the
            obligations of the recipient in more detail, has made the effective
            date of the agreement from the date the project application is filed
            versus when it is signed. Record keeping requirements from the
            recipient have also changed from “up to and including 24&nbsp;months
            after the final contribution is made under the agreement” to
            “36&nbsp;months after final payment”.
          </p>
          <p>
            PFP staff indicate that a performance monitoring framework for the
            new Terms and Conditions (June 2015) has not been put in place yet
            as measures have not yet been identified. Staff also indicates that
            the hearing process lacks measures that can generate information
            that would be useful for performance management of the program.
            Overall, feedback from staff suggests that the program could improve
            performance measurement and a systematic approach to collecting
            feedback and data to determine whether it is meeting its objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally the PFP would ask one question in the application form to
            know how applicants learned about the program. As well, some of the
            claim form templates also had one yes/no question to obtain feedback
            on whether the funding award made it easier for the applicant to
            participate in the hearing. PFP staff note in their review of
            previous applications and claim forms that these questions were not
            asked each time and the program was not clear enough in its
            documentation or analysis on how this feedback was obtained or what
            the results mean. As well, there are times the recipients did not
            answer the brief survey questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program changed the application template in December 2014 and
            incorporated a longer survey in order to have immediate feedback
            from applicants. The PFP Guide also reiterates the request for
            applicants to complete the survey in order to help the NEB to
            evaluate the effectiveness of the program in meeting program
            objectives and to help identify potential improvements in program
            administration. The survey asks, for example, how applicants learned
            about the funding opportunity, if they find the form understandable
            and easy to fill out and provide suggestions for how to improve it.
            Since introducing this update, the program is tracking responses and
            comments. This evaluation did not consider this evidence because it
            solicits feedback for hearings that are outside the scope of the
            evaluation.
          </p>
          <h5>3.2.1.4 Timeliness</h5>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            The program could better define timelines in the process to allow
            award recipients adequate time for preparing to participate in the
            hearing process.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Preparing for Participation</strong></p>
          <p>
            The TBS Policy on Transfer Payments (2008) requires “reasonable and
            practical departmental service standards for transfer payment
            programs”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participant feedback suggests that for some the public notice about
            the availability of funding was given too late [4/8]. A few said it
            was just right [2/8] and the rest had no response. One participant
            found that funding was too late for them to consider an expert
            witness and another similarly stated that the approval process
            should be quicker so there is adequate time to prepare for a
            hearing. Participants indicate that they could have used more time
            to prepare effectively for the hearing they were involved in [3/8],
            some said they didn’t have enough time [2/8] and a few were
            uncertain [3/8]. Complaints tracked by the program also indicate
            that applicants and participants are concerned about the timing of
            the process and thus the impact on their ability to participate.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were also a number of comments from internal stakeholders
            related to the timing of funding. They note that the PFP was
            introduced in 2010 whereas the Application to Participate was
            formalized later in 2012 following changes to the NEB Act. This
            change has introduced some challenges and confusion in explaining
            the two processes which are kept separate but are also related with
            the funding award dependent on a successful application to
            participate as an intervenor. The funding application requests
            applicants to provide a response to their intervenor status however
            the internal process map for the program has not documented for
            staff how and when to confirm the intervenor status of funding
            applicants.
          </p>
          <p>
            A staff member pointed out that the PFP could be more in sync with
            the hearing process timelines (or vice versa) such that once funding
            is approved it is readily available. Others suggested reviewing the
            timing of the PFP process, ensure timely notification and make
            funding available sooner in order to allow recipients the time to
            prepare for the hearing. Having a deadline of 30 or 60&nbsp;days
            before the first date of the hearing makes it challenging for the
            program to carry out its processes in a timely fashion especially if
            applications are received closer to this deadline and applications
            are reviewed on a rolling basis. According to the June 2010 Terms
            and Conditions of the PFP, funding was eligible after the
            contribution agreement is signed, thus a funding deadline close to
            the hearing leaves very little time for an applicant to use the
            funding on the costs they incur to prepare for the hearing. Others
            suggested that the Application to Participate (ATP) process could
            occur first so that the PFP could dedicate its resources to
            assessing applications that have already confirmed that the
            applicant has intervenor status.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first six PFP news releases included the deadline to submit an
            application. This changed for subsequent news releases to applying
            ‘as soon as possible’. Variation was observed in the deadlines, and
            the program has continued to use a “60&nbsp;days before the first
            day of the oral portion of a hearing” deadline, later updating this
            on the NEB website to the actual date once known. In the past,
            deadlines likely provided more certainty for potential applicants in
            organizing their time. Recommending potential applicants to “apply
            as soon as possible” may also cause undue confusion.
          </p>
          <p>The following calculations were made using program data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Nine out of ten&nbsp;hearings examined in this evaluation had a
              Project Description<sup id="fn33-rf"
                ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn33"
                  ><span class="wb-inv ">Footnote </span>33</a
                ></sup
              >. It took an average of 63&nbsp;days (or range of
              28-113&nbsp;days) to announce the availability of funding for a
              given project following receipt of the Project Description. This
              time period is used to prepare the PFP process and includes
              determining the funding envelope.
            </li>
            <li>
              Letters rom the NEB and MPMO to potentially impacted Aboriginal
              groups were usually sent out between 0-21&nbsp;days following the
              PFP notice of funding.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the ten&nbsp;hearings reviewed, applicants had between 29 and
              494&nbsp;days to apply for funding. The first six&nbsp;hearings
              eligible for participant funding had a similar time frame to apply
              (29-63&nbsp;days) whereas the following four&nbsp;hearings ranged
              from 219-494&nbsp;days.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the five projects that had an application deadline that
              preceded the Hearing Order, the List of Parties (lists the
              approved participants and level of participation), was issued 106
              to 270&nbsp;days after the PFP deadline. This means that those
              awarded participant funding would have waited several months for
              confirmation of intervenor status and thus confirmation that their
              expenses could be reimbursed in accordance with the conditions of
              their Contribution Agreement. In these cases, there was an average
              of five&nbsp;months between the date the List of Parties was
              issued and the first date of the hearing, which is time that
              recipients could use to prepare to participate. The PFP Guide
              (2010) mentions that a successful application for participant
              funding does not guarantee that an applicant will be successful at
              obtaining intervenor status and cautions applicants about this
              possibility prior to incurring costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              One project did not file a Project Description, and the hearing
              followed a different timeline with the PFP process commencing
              after the Hearing Order was issued (<a href="#fg4"
                >Figure&nbsp;4</a
              >). While this resulted in a smaller gap in time (12&nbsp;days)
              between the PFP deadline and the date the List of Parties was
              confirmed, there was less time available to prepare (approximately
              3&nbsp;months) compared to the other hearings.
            </li>
            <li>
              The other four more recent hearings had the deadline to apply for
              PFP occur after the ATP deadline and issuance of the List of
              Parties. As a result, participants also had around 5&nbsp;months
              to prepare for the hearing.
            </li>
            <li>
              In general, the List of Parties was issued before the contribution
              agreements were signed by the NEB or close to the date when some
              of the first agreements for a given hearing were signed. When
              comparing the date the List of Parties was issued to the date the
              applicant submitted their signed application, there were 69
              applications in which the intervenor status of the applicant
              applying for funding would have been known. The other 88
              applications for funding were received between 6-231&nbsp;days
              before the intervenor status of the applicant was confirmed.
              Either situation could be applicable within a particular hearing
              and its funding opportunity especially when applications were
              reviewed and awarded as they were submitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Funding is meant to help participants prepare for and participate
              in public hearings. On average, each funding opportunity has
              allowed at least 30-60&nbsp;days to apply. More recent hearings
              allow far more days (225-494&nbsp;days). Applicants sometimes sign
              their contribution agreement on the day they receive it and
              sometimes send it back to the NEB for its signature more than
              2&nbsp;months later. Once the program receives the signed
              contribution agreement from the applicant, it proceeds to sign it
              usually the day received or within the next 3&nbsp;weeks.
              <a href="#t13">Table&nbsp;13</a> below indicates how long
              applicants can expect, on average, between applying for funding
              and receiving their signed contribution agreement from the NEB,
              while <a href="#fg3">Figures&nbsp;3-7</a> illustrate the hearing
              process for a few projects and a calculation of timelines between

              approach to the process, timelines and the order in which key
              activities are carried out.

              delivery in the past, but more recently, it has committed

              the response from the Board was either timely, very timely or
              neither [6/8]. Half were satisfied with how their concern/
              question was addressed while two were very unsatisfied. Some
              thought that the NEB representative understood their concern; one
              applicant thought they were given misleading information on the
              likelihood of funding; and another commented that they found the
              representative helpful but was unsure what questions to ask due to
              unfamiliarity with the process.

            <strong>Note:</strong><br />
            The NEB holds hearings for Oral Traditional Evidence (OTE) to
            acknowledge that Aboriginal peoples have an oral tradition for
            sharing certain information and writing may not be an adequate way
            to share it. OTE forms part of the evidence that a Hearing Panel
            will consider when assessing the Project.

          <p><strong>Reimbursing Claims</strong></p>
          <p>
            Participants indicate in their feedback that they either estimated
            their costs accurately or underestimated them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, the PFP used to send the expense claims and supporting
            documentation from applicants to finance staff for processing.
            Later, the process was changed to the program assessing the claims
            for completeness and accuracy and then forwarding a payment request
            to finance staff. The program has also recently updated delegated
            signing authority to make the process more efficient. The program
            usually has a few interim payment requests and rarely has a request
            for an advance of funds. All recipients must submit a final claim
            within 60&nbsp;days of the close of the hearing. The PFP Coordinator
            is responsible for reviewing the claims when they are first
            submitted, verifying the expenses and retaining the documentation.
            The finance team reviews the payment request and follows-up with the
            program if there are any concerns or questions. The finance team
            also processes payment requests for the funding review committee
            following receipt of their invoice. In order to clarify how it will
            work with the PFP overall, finance staff documented the roles and
            responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the evaluation, it was understood that the approved payment
            requests are forwarded by finance staff to another government
            processing center for actual payment to the recipient. Originally
            the evaluation intended to calculate the time to reimburse a
            complete claim, however this information about actual payment dates
            would reside in another government department and if there were a
            service standard, if would be outside the program’s control.

          <p>
            An expected result of the TBS
            <em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em> (2008) is “applicants and
            recipients are engaged in support of innovation, continuous
            improvement and the establishment of fair, transparent and positive
            relations with them.”<sup id="fn34-rf"

          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Program is fair and transparent, providing information and
            instructions on each funding opportunity as well as publically
            sharing the names of recipients and their awards. The program
            demonstrated that it is working to have greater transparency in its
            assessment approach and feedback to applicants.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Transparency and fairness of the process</strong></p>
          <p>
            Five out of eight participants responded that the funding
            application process is clear and fair. They also thought it had
            improved in the last few years. Half of the participants either
            agreed or strongly agreed that the PFP documentation was clear about
            the information required to apply. One respondent found that the
            instructions were clear, the examples helped to complete the form,
            and through its website, the NEB clearly explained which costs were
            eligible. On the question of whether the eligibility requirements
            were clear, participants overall either agreed or were neutral.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staff and the FRC members suggested that receiving applications on a
            rolling basis and then assessing them as they come makes it
            challenging to allocate the limited funding envelope in a fair
            manner. Fairness is best achieved by consistency in the process.
            Staff also acknowledges that the program has to be flexible in order
            to ensure fairness, such that when the company proposes a new route
            during the hearing process that may affect new people, the PFP has
            responded by opening up the process again if it has already closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Application to Participate (ATP) was introduced in 2012,
            the process and decisions makers were kept separate from the funding
            program in order to keep participation and funding decisions fair
            and independent.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Funding recommendations</strong></p>
          <p>
            Participant feedback indicates that for those that who didn’t find
            the process clear and fair, they were mainly concerned with the lack
            of clarity in the application or feel they were not provided clear
            reasons why their application for funding was denied even after
            requesting an explanation. For those participants who had their
            application for funding denied [2/8], they report that they did not
            receive an explanation. One participant thought there is a lack of
            transparency from the funding review committee and the process to
            determine the allocation or amounts for funding. Another perceived
            that the program favours some groups over others. Participants
            suggest that when they receive a decision on funding it should
            include the assessment criteria and its rating. This type of
            information and feedback could help an applicant on their future
            applications for funding. A review of funding notices to those
            denied confirms this opinion - there was no specific explanation
            tailored to the applicant that received a notice. The program states
            that it has since addressed this starting in 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders also provided feedback, and suggested that the
            program could enhance transparency in its reasons for decisions on
            funding. They indicate that they are aware of the opinions of
            applicants that the funding decisions could be clearer and that
            there could be an improved response to complaints. Others commented
            that they already see evidence of this challenge being resolved.
            Interviews with staff confirm this - the program is looking to give
            more comprehensive and specific reasons why applicants do not
            receive funding or indicate for those that do, why the amounts are
            less then requested. This will improve consistency and quality of
            review. As well, the funding review committee is formalizing their
            analysis and recommendations.
          </p>

            In its 2014 Annual Report<sup id="fn35-rf"

              ></sup
            >, the NEB indicates that it has responded to this type of feedback
            to make decisions more transparent by including reasons.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Disclosing Awards</strong></p>
          <p>
            The NEB is required to demonstrate transparency by reporting all
            decisions by the Funding Review Committee. Thus it publishes the
            list of awards per funding opportunity to its website once all the
            awards have been made for a particular project. Currently there are
            4 projects with a funding report available on the website and staff
            indicated that they plan to publish all past hearings as well.
            Program staff is also evaluating its approach to assessing the
            information shared through the website to ensure consistency across
            documentation, and to prepare for information to be re-launched
            through the canada.ca web renewal project<sup id="fn36-rf"

            The NEB also discloses contribution awards over $25,000 on a

          <p>
            In its 2014 Annual Report, the NEB reports that an application for
            judicial review was filed June&nbsp;10, 2014 with respect to a
            decision for the participant funding program which denied the
            applicants’ request for funding for the Trans Mountain Expansion
            project application. A hearing took place on March&nbsp;23, 2015 and
            the courts recently dismissed this application on September&nbsp;22,

            Most of the eligible public and Aboriginal groups that applied for
            funding were awarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders were asked whether funding enabled adequate
            levels of public and Aboriginal participation. Half of those that
            responded to this question indicate that they did not know and
            suggested that the program should focus on meaningful participation
            as opposed to assessing ‘adequate participation’. In response to
            whether funding led to more meaningful public participation, again
            half the respondents indicated that they did not know while a third
            of respondents thought it had. Many, however, suggested that overall
            it is challenging to define or assess whether PFP facilitates
            meaningful participation. Many commented that it could be misleading
            to attribute meaningful participation solely to the funding program.
            Anecdotally, however, some staff heard from participants that
            participant funding helped them to participate more fully in the
            hearing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participation levels may have gone up over time; however staff point
            out that assessing the adequacy of numbers participating in a
            hearing is difficult. Internal stakeholders felt they do not have
            the information to determine this outcome. They recommended that the
            hearing process could incorporate measures and help to assess this
            outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders were also asked whether participant funding
            led to more evidence (written or oral) for oral hearings. The
            majority of respondents (66%) indicated that they did not know while
            some said yes (25%) and the rest answered no or did not answer.
            Respondents also provided mixed comments with some again suggesting
            that it is hard to assess this and report on it. A few suggested
            that they noticed the evidence becoming more sophisticated but where
            unsure whether this could be attributed to PFP or if it reflects
            that participants are more aware about hearings. Others have found
            that the quality of evidence may have increased but not necessarily
            the quantity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP has done preliminary work to consolidate data and document
            the nature of participation by those awarded funding by counting the
            number of items on the record and noting the information that was
            filed for the hearing. It was not as clear how this information is
            being used by the program for analysis and to assess its objectives
            or measures of success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the PFP is to also encourage effective public
            participation that ensures public concerns and values are taken into
            consideration. The funding guide for the program specifies that to
            apply for funding, applicants have to demonstrate the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Proposed activities must relate to the “list of issues”</li>
            <li>
              Proposed activities must be unique (not duplicating the
              information available from other sources)
            </li>
            <li>
              An applicant must demonstrate an interest in the proposed project
              that relates to one the following:
              <ul>
                <li>direct, local interest;</li>
                <li>
                  local community insights and/or Aboriginal traditional
                  knowledge about the proposed project;
                </li>
                <li>
                  an interest in how the potential project may affect Aboriginal
                  lands or rights, or
                </li>
                <li>expert information relevant to the proposed project.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In July 2012, changes made to the
            <em>National Energy Board Act</em> include the addition of
            section&nbsp;55.2, which sets out when the Board will allow a person
            to participate in a hearing. Applicants must demonstrate to the
            Board’s satisfaction that they stand to be directly affected by a
            project or have relevant information and expertise that could help
            the Board gain a greater understanding of the project under
            consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders responded to the question whether they think
            funded intervenors provided oral hearings with information that
            contributes to a better understanding of the impacts of a project
            and informs the Panel’s recommendation/decision - and a large
            majority of respondents (65%) said they did not know. Around
            one-third said yes. Comments in relation to this question indicate
            that again, internal stakeholders are uncertain whether participant
            funding plays a role in whole or part or they suggest that it would
            depend on the project and the Hearing Panel assessing the usefulness
            of information. For those that answered yes to the question, they
            felt that funding has allowed people to raise local issues and
            suggest that evidence from studies/review is informative. One staff
            member noted that since the program began, the evidence has improved
            in quality. Internal stakeholders suggest that the program staff
            should examine how to assess ‘value-added information’ for each
            hearing and overall if it is an objective and ultimate outcome for
            the PFP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data from the program indicates that the PFP has not had many
            applications from non-Aboriginal groups in the first five&nbsp;years
            it has existed. <a href="#fg8">Figure&nbsp;8</a> shows that the
            number of applications from Aboriginal groups is almost double that
            of non-Aboriginal individuals or groups for ten&nbsp;hearings
            examined in this evaluation. Internal stakeholders suggest in their
            feedback that they have observed that participation by Aboriginal
            groups has been increasing with funding and that the information
            from these groups about the potential impacts of proposed projects
            is useful.

            A comparison of the different types of intervenors for the last
            nine&nbsp;hearings that have concluded shows that many of those who
            participated would have been ineligible for funding (e.g. companies,
            government). <a href="#t14">Table&nbsp;14</a> illustrates this
            below. There was very little participation by non-Aboriginal groups
            or individuals or associations when the PFP was introduced in 2010,
            but this changed starting in 2012 with the Line&nbsp;9B hearing.

            As already indicated, the majority of funding applications has come
            from Aboriginal groups and <a href="#t16">Table&nbsp;16</a> below
            illustrates this further. The number of Aboriginal groups that
            actually applied for funding tends to be lower than the number of
            groups determined as potentially impacted by the MPMO and NEB.
            Overall, though, Aboriginal groups usually represent 100% of
            applications in the early years of the PFP.

          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>Most applicants that were awarded accessed their funding.</p>
          <p>
            Participants indicate that they would have not been able to
            participate without funding from the program [5/6]. These five
            participants that received funding state that they submitted oral or
            written evidence during the hearing; however they were split in
            their opinions on how effectively they were able to present their
            views and raise their concerns. While three believed they were
            effective or somewhat effective, two said they didn’t feel effective
            and the other participant said they didn’t know. Participants
            indicated that with regards to the benefit of eligible expense
            categories, it was either positive or had no impact. For those that
            indicated it was positive, they suggested it was legal
            representation, expert information and the travel to the hearing
            that helped as well as community consultation, collecting
            information and providing honoraria.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most applicants that were awarded usually accessed their funding as
            shown in <a href="#t17">Table&nbsp;17</a> below for the nine
            completed hearings. There were several instances where applicants
            withdrew from the hearing after their award was approved and signed
            or their funding was terminated because they did not participate in
            the hearing. Sometimes awardees did not submit final invoices. In

          <h3 id="s3_3">3.3 Efficiency and Economy</h3>
          <p>
            The TBS Evaluation Policy (2009) defines both efficiency and
            economy. Efficiency is the extent to which resources are used such
            that outputs are produced at a minimum cost. Economy is minimizing
            the use of resources (cost) to achieve expected outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB is required to have a participant funding program and there
            is no alternative at this time. Thus the evaluation of efficiency
            and economy focussed on obtaining and analyzing performance
            measurement data to examine optimal utilization of resources and
            possible areas for improvement.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Evaluation questions in this section include:</strong></p>
          <ol class="list-unstyled ">
            <li>
              <strong>5a:</strong> Is the PFP delivered efficiently in
              comparison with similar programs? Are there ways to improve
              program delivery?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>5b:</strong> Are the PFP resources (dedicated staff and
              the Funding Review Committee) appropriate/adequate to deliver the
              program?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>3.3.1 Efficiency of Program Delivery</h4>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            Program efficiency has improved over time; however program
            administration can be streamlined.
          </p>
          <p>
            The TBS Directive on Transfer Payments (2008) defines efficiency of
            payment as those payments that can be processed quickly and that
            documentation sought in support of payments is only that which is
            necessary and sufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            External stakeholders indicate in their feedback that they
            experience an average to high level of administrative effort related
            to the PFP process in general. In particular, the application and
            claims process takes extra time and payments can be slower than
            expected. External stakeholders suggest that the claim forms could
            be clearer and more examples of eligible costs and level of costs
            would also be helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders also readily provided feedback about PFP
            related to program delivery and process. Almost half of respondents
            believe that the administration of PFP has improved over the last
            few years and the other half did not know for sure. One respondent
            commented that it is efficient for PFP to be implemented by the NEB.
            A few suggested that so far, having PFP restricted to oral hearings
            has hindered the Panel from choosing the optimal format for the
            hearing - which in some cases is a written process. By choosing an
            oral hearing, the Panel has been able to ensure that participant
            funding would be made available. With the recent changes to the
            Terms and Conditions to include other hearings other than oral this
            issue will likely be resolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal stakeholders also suggested that funding could be made
            available earlier in the process to ensure that participants will be
            assured that they have funding in place to support their preparation
            activities for the hearing. With the new Terms and Conditions,
            however, eligible activities will now be funded from when the date
            the company files their application instead of when the contribution
            agreement is signed. This may make a difference, but the applicant
            is still required to obtain intervenor status, for which the timing
            is not necessarily before the funding award and contribution
            agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few stakeholders also suggested that applicants could be further
            encouraged to collaborate and cooperate to minimize duplication of
            information, though others mentioned that it could be challenging or
            unrealistic to achieve this. Other general comments relate to
            performance management, with the suggestion that there could be
            better tracking and measurement of the expected outcomes of the
            Program and that the hearing process should take part in helping to
            assess this. This evaluation notes that the newer Application Form
            for funding requests the applicant to provide suggestions to improve
            the application form. The Application Guide encourages applicants to
            respond to this request in order to help the NEB evaluate the
            Program’s effectiveness in meeting program objectives and to
            identify potential improvements in administration.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Information Management</strong></p>
          <p>
            The PFP has identified that the current content management software
            (known as the Records Documents and Information Management System,
            or RDIMS) generally used at the NEB is not optimal for the nature of
            work involved in administering a funding program. It is time
            consuming to manage information on this system and it lacks the
            tools necessary to easily organize information by project and
            applicant or to compile and analyze qualitative or quantitative
            data. A review of documentation on the current system demonstrates
            that there have been multiple and incomplete attempts to organize
            and track information. The program should have a better tool for
            program management especially since it expects that it will
            experience growing demand and thus administrative work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP has already recognized this as an opportunity and is working
            to review the issue and establish a new system for program
            management. This new system will address case management and improve
            workflow, thus allowing program staff to better manage the workload
            and track data in a practical way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system will be accessible by PFP staff only. During the
            evaluation, the program indicated it had already piloted a solution
            and was working with other interested departments about the options
            to permanently implement this solution.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Benchmarking</strong></p>
          <p>
            There are some similarities in terms of goals and in the design of
            the participant funding programs at the NEB, the CNSC and the
            Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA). Those involved with
            the NEB participant funding program are not necessarily familiar
            with the details or outcomes of these other programs to draw
            conclusions about the efficiency of the PFP in relation to funding
            programs at CNSC and CEAA.
          </p>
          <p>
            CEAA has had a participant funding program since 1990 and first
            evaluated it in March 2009 and is currently conducting its second
            evaluation in 2015. The CNSC was approved to introduce a participant
            funding program at the same time as the NEB and has evaluated its
            program in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            CNSC performed a comparative analysis for its recent evaluation
            covering FY&nbsp;2011-12 to FY&nbsp;2013-14. CNSC calculates, for
            all three organizations, the funds awarded (output) per full-time
            equivalent (FTE) as a measure of efficiency such that a higher
            number of recipients per program FTE indicates greater efficiency.
            It found comparable levels of efficiency for all three
            organizations. Calculations by CNSC were based on 2 FTE at the NEB.
          </p>
          <p>
            The evaluation of the NEB’s program though takes into account that
            it has one FTE funded by the PFP and the second FTE funded by the
            Application Business Unit and thus efficiency calculations can also
            be done using one FTE. As well it is important to note that other
            staff are involved in processing and awarding applications but
            aren’t directly supported by the PFP budget (e.g. records, mail room
            and finance). Another consideration is that time and effort is spent
            reviewing applications (including review by the FRC) even if they do
            not result in a contribution agreement or the project is cancelled
            by the company prior to the hearing.

          <p>
            Due to the timing of PFP and its process which usually overlaps
            fiscal years, applications for funding may occur in a different
            fiscal year than when the contribution agreement is awarded and
            signed. This explains the large difference between the value of
            funding requested, awarded and paid.

            CEAA has the largest budget for contribution payments and also makes

            the NEB or CNSC for each year from 2011-12 to 2013-14 and overall.
            The CNSC has increased the amount of contribution payments each year
            while the National Energy Board has been variable, due to an
            overestimation of the budget for contributions FY&nbsp;2012-13.

          <h4>3.3.2 Adequacy of resources for program delivery</h4>
          <p><strong>Findings and Supporting Evidence</strong></p>
          <p>
            The workload can be variable depending on the number of funding
            opportunities underway and the number of applications to process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Participant Funding Program has a modest budget for staffing and
            supports a full-time Manager while the Applications Business Unit
            funds the full-time co-ordinator position to ensure there is
            adequate staffing to administer the program. Over the last
            five&nbsp;years, the co-ordinator position has had some turnover -
            which has caused, according to internal stakeholders, a risk of
            continuity in knowledge for the program. Stakeholders have noted,
            though, a recent focussed effort on improving process documentation
            which should help to mitigate the risk of staff turnover.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program is also supported by the Financial Services staff at the
            NEB for the processing of payments. Finance staff estimate that they
            spend 5 to 10% of their time supporting PFP which they prioritize
            over their other work. They are able to process payment requests
            within 2-3&nbsp;days before sending these on to another government
            department for direct payment to recipients. Finance is also
            impacted by the program’s staff turnover and has stated that it can
            get time consuming to educate PFP staff in financial management.
          </p>
          <p>
            During interviews with internal stakeholders, no major concerns were
            raised about the adequacy or appropriateness of PFP resources except
            to acknowledge that the workload is variable depending on where in
            the process the program is on a given day for a particular hearing.
            It also depends on the number of individual PFP opportunities in
            progress and the demand in terms of applications. Workload can be
            unpredictable since it is a demand driven program. Internal
            stakeholders indicated that it is important though for those working
            for or in relation to the PFP, that they have adequate training and
            experience in transfer payment programs and financial management in
            order to deliver the program effectively and efficiently.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Program Delivery Costs</strong></p>
          <p>
            The program has a specific time code that staff can use to record
            their hours of work if related to the program. This is a way of
            tracking the level of involvement. Data from the TIME system is
            useful for analysis if the system is used properly. A review of the
            hours coded to the program though shows inconsistent use of the time
            code which makes the data an approximation at best.

          <p>
            Over the last five&nbsp;years, 60&nbsp;people have coded time to the
            PFP for a total of 15,759&nbsp;hours. The bulk of time spent on PFP
            is from directly involved staff (PFP Coordinator, Director, Manager
            and Steering Committee). This table does not include the hours
            billed by the Funding Review Committee for this time period
            (530&nbsp;hours).
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, the participant funding program was expected to use a
            maximum of 13% of its total funding per year on administration which
            is made up of salary, operating &amp; maintenance costs, travel,
            communications, translation and professional fees for the Funding
            Review Committee. As well, it was expected that the administration
            costs would vary by year and could potentially decrease after the
            program had finalized its design and start-up and gained more
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since contribution funds for a given hearing may be paid out over
            multiple years and administration costs may be incurred in a
            different year than when the actual contribution payment is made, it
            is difficult to calculate whether the program has achieved this
            administrative overhead target of 13%. According to the original
            budget for the program, an average of 9% was budgeted towards
            personnel and operation &amp; maintenance costs and 91% on average
            towards contribution payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data for the last five&nbsp;years of the PFP was obtained from
            program and finance staff. Not including FY&nbsp;2010-11 (because
            there were no contribution payments made), personnel and O&amp;M
            costs represented 24-61% of total spending (40% on average) and
            contribution payments represented the remaining 39-76% (60% on
            average) of total spending as shown in<a href="#t21">
              Table&nbsp;21</a
            >
            below.<sup id="fn42-rf"
              ><a class="fn-lnk " href="#fn42"

              ></sup
            >
            Thus the data indicate that the program has spent more per year on
            administering the program than it planned for when compared to the
            level of contribution payments. This is due in part to including the
            coordinator position as part of actual spending and, as staff note,
            the contribution payments follow the hearing schedule, so when a
            hearing concludes, most of the payments are made. Payments may occur
            in another fiscal year from when the contribution agreement was
            signed which results in variable level of contribution payments each
            fiscal year.

            Using the data provided by the program and finance staff, a few
            other calculations were made to understand the average costs of PFP
            over the past five&nbsp;years:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The ratio of budgeted program costs to overall budget ranged from
              7-12%
            </li>
            <li>The ratio of program costs to funding envelopes was 19%.</li>
            <li>
              The ratio of program costs to value of awards offered (before
              agreements signed) was 19%. This is 20% when compared to signed
              contribution agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ratio of program costs to contribution payments was 53% (note
              that costs have been incurred to administer the program for Trans
              Mountain Expansion, however payments are still ongoing in another
              fiscal year from when they were awarded).
            </li>
            <li>
              Overall, 100% of the personnel and O&amp;M budget has been used to
              operate the program, with some variation from year to year. The
              O&amp;M cost has stayed within budget for the first
              three&nbsp;years of operation. The other more recent years have
              spent more than budgeted as shown in
              <a href="#t22">Table&nbsp;22</a> below. The largest share of
              O&amp;M spending each year is usually due to fees for Funding
              Review Committee members.

            <li>
              Over the five&nbsp;year period examined by this evaluation, there
              have been a total of 157 funding applications for
              10&nbsp;hearings. The costs for salary (2&nbsp;positions) as well
              as O&amp;M totals $797,869.42. Thus an average of $5,082 is spent
              to process each application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Alternatively, over the last five&nbsp;years, as illustrated in
              <a href="#t23">Table&nbsp;23</a> above, there have been a total of
              120&nbsp;awards for 10&nbsp;hearings. This represents a cost of
              $6,649 per award. If calculating the cost per signed contribution
              agreement for 10&nbsp;hearings, this represents a cost of $7,746
              per funded participant to administer the program. These
              calculations are used to demonstrate that there are costs incurred
              to process applications, even if they don’t result in awards or
              signed agreements.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
          <p>
            Communications staff at the NEB create the advertising plan overall
            for a hearing which includes participant funding. The Secretary’s
            Office approves the advertising budget. Placing individual ads
            require approval from Management Services to comply with the
            <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (section&nbsp;52). The NEB is
            responsible for tracking advertising costs and reporting through the
            government-wide Advertising Information System (AdMIS). The
            evaluation noted from staff that tracking actual advertising costs
            for PFP has begun in the past fiscal year. They indicate that to
            review past data on the allocation of advertising costs to the PFP
            versus other hearing related advertising would be a cumbersome
            process since this information is not readily available. Staff
            indicate that going forward they will be tracking advertising in
            more detail to support analysis as required.
          </p>
          <p>
            This evaluation examined the currently available data that
            identifies PFP advertising costs and found that in FY&nbsp;2014-15
            the actual cost for advertising the PFP would have been over 200% of
            the program’s O&amp;M budget. This supports the observation made by
            staff that the PFP advertising costs are kept as part of the overall
            hearing costs because the program’s O&amp;M budget is limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, staff suggest that the PFP advertising should be both
            tracked and accounted for through the program’s budget rather than
            the hearing budget overall. This would allow PFP staff direct access
            to their data and initiate their PFP news release sooner rather than
            waiting for sign-off on the overall advertising plan for a hearing
            and also allow them to track and analyze the effectiveness of the
            advertising process.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Funding Review Committee</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Funding Review Committee (FRC) is also funded through the PFP
            budget and started off with compensation of $500 per diem for the
            first 6 eligible hearings. In 2013, this was raised to the current
            amount of $1000 per diem (pro-rated per hour). The program could not
            produce documentation with rationale for this change, however
            several staff mentioned that it could have been based on some
            comparison with other government consultant rates or based on
            feedback from committee members.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2012-13, the PFP spent a part of its budget to recruit members
            for its external funding review committee. Total costs incurred for
            newspaper advertising was around $30,000. Interviews with the
            Funding Review Committee members indicate that only a few found out
            about the opportunity through advertising, and rather they were
            informed by their network.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last five&nbsp;years, a Funding Review Committee was
            required to review applications, in order to mitigate the risk of
            bias. The program’s newer Terms and Conditions (June 2015) now state
            that it they may use a funding review committee to assess
            applications. Staff support using an independent committee to make
            recommendations for awards but indicate that it can be time
            consuming to coordinate an external committee especially with an
            increasing number of applications to review against a limited
            funding envelope. Members of the Funding Review Committee also
            indicate that it can be challenging to allocate funding on a rolling
            basis rather than waiting for all the applications to arrive and
            thus making an informed assessment and allocation. Staff suggests
            that they have already streamlined the work required by a FRC in
            allocating amounts by recently introducing funding caps per
            applicant or group.
          </p>
          <p>
            The invoices and payments to FRC members were also assessed. Members
            receive an appointment letter stating which hearing they are
            assigned to assess funding applications for. It states the per diem
            and the other costs (such as travel) that will be reimbursed should
            they arise. Very recently, the program has added the estimated value
            of the agreement with the FRC member. Members are required to submit
            invoices detailing the nature of their work and time spent on it in
            order to claim their professional fees. As noted before, the per
            diem rate doubled from $500 to $1000 in FY&nbsp;2013-14. For the
            ten&nbsp;hearings examined in this evaluation, the average FRC hours
            has been around 3.4&nbsp;hours per application but has ranged on
            average from 0.6 to 9.1&nbsp;hours.
            <a href="#fg10">Figure&nbsp;10</a> below illustrates the variation
            and range of FRC hours by project
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost of a committee member to review each application ranges on
            average from $40 to $1,207 which is an average of $418 per
            application. This range in cost by member may be explained by the
            variation in hours. Most funding opportunities had at least two
            external members and sometimes three. Cases were observed where a
            FRC member would submit an invoice with more than three times as
            many hours as another member for the same funding opportunity
            review. No further work was done though in this evaluation to
            determine the possible explanations for this as the PFP staff have
            since changed and there was no evidence of the program analyzing the
            FRC and trends in cost or effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approximately $95,822 has been spent on the FRC ($30,212 on
            advertising for FRC members in FY&nbsp;2012-13 and $65,610 in
            professional fees for the ten&nbsp;hearings examined in the
            evaluation). This represents 2.3% of total funding awarded and
            around 2.4% of the value of contribution agreements signed.

            There has been administrative work related to hearings that were
            ultimately changed to written hearings or cancelled by the company,
            as well there would have been administrative costs in
            FY&nbsp;2014-15 that relate to hearings which are still in progress
            or have not been awarded or paid out within the time period under

            This data shows that 50% of applications requested more than
            $75,000, however only 9% were awarded this amount or more.
            Applicants were usually awarded less than they asked for in their
            application. This could be due to the funding application request
            including ineligible activities, or the higher level of demand for
            funding against a limited funding envelope which results in a
            smaller amount available for each award. The FRC reviews each
            application and as outlined in the Program Funding Guide, assesses
            the following<sup id="fn43-rf"

            Following its review, the FRC provides a brief summary of reasons
            for its recommendation of awards in its report to the NEB. The data
            demonstrate that the FRC usually awards the full funding envelope
            and recommends the amount for each individual award, which is always
            less than what the applicants ask for. Over the last five&nbsp;years
            of the PFP, funding requests have almost always been higher than
            each funding envelope. Around $3.45&nbsp;million has been requested
            over the last nine completed hearings, however only
            $1.03&nbsp;million has been awarded from funding envelopes totalling
            $1.24&nbsp;million. The difference between the amount requested and
            awarded is $2.42&nbsp;million.
          </p>
          <p>
            As stated previously, there are likely several factors contributing
            to this large difference between amount requested and awarded. For
            example, demand for funding might be less than the funding envelope
            for a given hearing. As shown in
            <a href="#t26">Table&nbsp;26</a> below, there were two&nbsp;hearings
            where the total amount requested was less than the funding envelope.
            After the FRC reviewed the applications, the amount awarded was even
            less. Another factor could be the level of experience applicants
            have in filling in their applications and uncertainty how to
            calculate anticipated costs, or activities proposed could be
            ineligible as determined by the program or FRC. Another factor
            (which has since changed), was the lack of individual or group
            funding maximums to guide the applicant’s assessment of proposed
            expenses and total amount requested.

            Demand for funding continues to be much higher than the level of
            funding available; however to conclude that there is a cost savings
            due to the assessment by the FRC should also take into account that
            the terms of the program require a funding review committee to
            assess applications against certain criteria and eligible costs
            before recommending awards. There is also difficulty in concluding
            whether the number of awards or the level of award has an effect on
            the program such that higher numbers and dollars would entail more
            time and effort by the program to manage and oversee. It is more
            likely that there is a direct link between the number of
            applications or number of funding opportunities occurring at the
            same time and an increase in program effort since each application
            is processed by the program and assessed by the FRC.

          <p><strong>Implementing new Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></p>
          <p>
            The new Terms and Conditions (2015) also introduce changes that may
            alter the demand to programs resources. Participant funding is no
            longer restricted to oral hearings but is extended to written public
            facilities hearings as well as the environmental assessment of
            designated projects under CEAA&nbsp;2012 regulated by the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> and for projects not
            subject to a public hearing under section&nbsp;24 of the NEB Act but
            require participation by the public in an environmental assessment
            under CEAA&nbsp;2012.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meetings with internal stakeholders indicate that work remains to be
            done to implement the changes proposed by the new Terms and
            Conditions. The program is also still assessing its timelines for
            announcing funding, setting deadlines and determining how a funding
            review committee will operate under these changes.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s4">4 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
          <p>
            Overall, it is evident that the program has undergone a few phases
            of growth and development as it gains experience and knowledge. This
            section presents the evaluation’s conclusions based on the findings
            presented in <a href="#s3">Section&nbsp;3</a>, and makes
            recommendations based on that analysis. Some of the recommendations
            address more than one core evaluation question.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s4_1">4.1 Demonstration of Relevance</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the evidence presented in
            <a href="#s3_1">Section&nbsp;3.1</a>, the Participant Funding
            Program is aligned with the roles, responsibilities and priorities
            of the federal government as well as the government priorities and
            the mandate, strategic outcome and priorities of the National Energy
            Board. There is a continuing need for PFP, primarily as a result of
            the <em>National Energy Board Act</em> and the
            <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (2012)</em>.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s4_2">
            4.2 Demonstration of Effectiveness: Achievement of Outcomes
          </h3>
          <p>
            The logic model created for this evaluation was based on the program
            description from the 2010&nbsp;PFP submission. A review of the
            original performance management framework reveals gaps in data
            collection and analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            This evaluation addresses the immediate and intermediate outcomes
            set for the program when it was initially introduced; however
            feedback from stakeholders as well as limited processes to collect
            and analyze information makes it difficult to fully conclude whether
            funding from the NEB’s PFP supports adequate levels of participation
            by the public or Aboriginal groups in oral hearings. As a result,
            this will make it more difficult to assess in a future evaluation
            whether the ultimate outcome of the PFP is achieved. This finding is
            important given the changes in June 2015 to the Terms and Conditions
            of the program and when determining the new program logic model and
            a performance management framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program has made recent improvements and updates to its
            process-related documentation. A review of how the PFP fits into the
            overall hearing process, though, shows variation over the past
            five&nbsp;years regarding the timelines and key milestones. Feedback
            from stakeholders suggests that having a separate process to apply
            to participate (ATP) versus applying for funding is confusing and
            could be more efficient if combined or if their timelines are
            adjusted with respect to other administrative processes for the
            hearing. There was also concern about confusion caused by changes to
            the funding process that are not communicated right away or in
            advance of the change.

                <strong>Recommendation&nbsp;1:</strong> It is recommended that
                in response to the new Terms and Conditions (June 2015), a logic
                model should be developed and corresponding performance measures
                that are SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and
                timely). Performance measures should be consistently tracked and
                reported. The program should also develop an approach to
                monitoring contribution agreements for compliance with terms and
                conditions in the agreement (e.g. the recipient’s deliverables).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Recommendation&nbsp;2:</strong> It is recommended that
                the staff involved in the PFP and Hearings work together to
                assess the hearing process timelines and key deliverables in
                order to realize efficiencies in the process and to allow for
                better planning of PFP and ATP. Integration of timelines for the
                PFP and ATP within the hearing process to the extent possible as
                well as consistency in the timing of key activities would help
                to ensure a fair, timely, accessible and transparent funding
                program.

            The PFP works with other business areas at the NEB to communicate
            information about the program. The website is used to provide
            information about current funding opportunities, engagement staff
            present information to the public and Aboriginal groups and
            newspaper advertising is used as one way to launch a funding
            opportunity. Staff from the finance team and applications and
            communications business units is essential to delivering the PFP and
            as such a common understanding of shared processes with the program
            is essential for its delivery.

                <strong>Recommendation&nbsp;3:</strong> It is recommended that
                the PFP work with other business areas (e.g. Applications,
                Communications and Finance) on a continuous basis to articulate
                their shared processes and to update and maintain internal and
                external documentation related to PFP in order to ensure that
                the program is accessible and communicated consistently both
                internally to staff and to the public. Good communication and
                coordination of information is important since the program
                requires assistance and advice from other internal services at
                the NEB. As well, frequent changes to the program design demands
                clear and consistent information to staff and the public.

          <p>
            Stakeholders support the objectives of the PFP and their feedback
            indicates that funding can off-set the cost of participation in the
            NEB hearings. Over the last five&nbsp;years, the number of
            applications has been variable, however most applicants with an
            award access their funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PFP advertises each funding opportunity in newspapers. As
            advertising is funded outside of the PFP budget and managed by
            communications staff, there is a lack of analysis about the
            effectiveness of advertising and the benefits of this approach.

            <ul class="list-unstyled ">
              <li>
                <strong>Recommendation&nbsp;4:</strong> It is recommended that
                the PFP assess its responsibility for budgeting and managing its
                communications costs and examine its approach for effectiveness
                in reaching eligible participant groups. Communications
                (including advertising) are an indirect cost to operating the
                program and it is important to assess various approaches to
                ensure that the resources are adequate and are used in a way
                that adds value and contributes to achieving program objectives.

            The PFP has used an external Funding Review Committee for the past
            five&nbsp;years to review applications and make funding
            recommendations. The program recently revised its Terms and
            Conditions (June 2015), which makes a FRC no longer mandatory.
          </p>
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <ul class="list-unstyled ">
              <li>
                <strong>Recommendation&nbsp;5:</strong> It is recommended that
                the PFP document its approach for determining its use of an
                external FRC. This guideline should have clear rules to ensure
                the predictability, transparency and fairness of the program and
                its process for reviewing applications and recommending awards.
                In developing an approach, the program could assess the level of
                effort and cost to coordinate a Funding Review Committee and
                determine the situations where it might be economical to use an
                FRC.

            The program has not been operating with a useful electronic platform
            for program management, creating an internal administrative burden
            and a risk of incomplete and inaccurate records and data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Recommendation&nbsp;6:</strong> It is recommended that the
              program make further improvements to efficiencies in its process
              overall by implementing a unique and centralized system to
              collect, analyze and report information related to specific
              projects and the program overall. Such a system could also improve
              workflow and control of the process and program documentation.

          <p>
            When the PFP was first developed in 2010, the budget was set for
            FY&nbsp;2010-11 to FY&nbsp;2014-15 and ongoing. It was based on
            information and NEB hearing processes available at the time. Changes
            to legislation as well as the expanded scope of the PFP following
            the new Terms and Conditions introduced in June 2015 are not
            accounted for or anticipated by the budget set for the program in
            2010. As well, inconsistent use of recording timesheets for work
            related to PFP hinders the ability to analyze and account for all
            staff time that contributes to the program.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Recommendation&nbsp;7:</strong> It is recommended that the
              Participant Funding Program use available data to track and
              monitor the level of contributions required as well as indirect
              costs (including all roles that are critical to operating the
              program). Tracking and monitoring all direct and indirect costs
              will allow the program to better assess its budgetary needs over
              time.

          <h2 id="nnx4">Annex&nbsp;4: Management of the Evaluation</h2>
          <p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong></p>
          <p>
            The evaluation was carried out by an evaluation specialist at the
            NEB responsible for all phases of the evaluation (planning,
            conducting and reporting). The Director of Corporate Performance
            reviewed and provided feedback on the terms of reference, evaluation
            plan, logic model, findings, draft and final reports as well as
            recommendations and participated in key meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Program and senior staff, as well as senior management reviewed the
            draft report and provided feedback and comments. The Evaluation
            Committee at the NEB, chaired by the Chief Operating Officer, is
            responsible for reviewing evaluation plans, reports, management
            responses and recommending approval to the Chair/CEO. The Committee
            met in November and provided feedback. The Evaluation Report was
            updated and presented to the Chair/CEO for approval.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Contracts</strong></p>
          <p>
            The external online survey was contracted to Prairie Research
            Associates Inc. (PRA) and took place in between February&nbsp;27 and
            March&nbsp;30, 2015. The survey was designed in consultation with
            the NEB and sent to 44 past applicants to the program. A report was
            prepared and submitted by the contractor in April 2015 which
            summarizes the results and comments from the respondents. The
            questions focused on participant awareness of NEB hearings and
            funding, communication with the NEB, the processes for applying and
            receiving notification of a decision on funding, participation in
            the hearing and the payments process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report provides a caution about interpreting the results,
            though; because the response rate was only 18% (8 participants
            completed the survey). Nevertheless, the results are mentioned
            throughout this evaluation in addition to other lines of evidence
            such as complaints by applicants or applicant responses to surveys
            built into the application form.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
          <p>
            With the approval of the Terms of Reference for the Evaluation in
            early July 2015, this left a very tight timeline to collect and
            analyze data, conduct interviews and writing to achieve a final
            published report by the original deadline of September&nbsp;30,
            2015. The timelines were revised and resulted in a draft report in
            October 2015 and subsequent review of the evaluation report from the
            program and management took place in November/December 2015.

            (highlighted in blue). Work on planning the evaluation started in
            late FY&nbsp;2014-15, however due to a change in staff the
            evaluation core work occurred between July and October 2015.

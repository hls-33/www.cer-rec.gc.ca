            />For over 50&nbsp;years, the National Energy Board has provided
            regulatory oversight for Canada’s energy infrastructure under the
            Board’s jurisdiction. More than 450 staff come to work every day
            knowing they have the important responsibility of keeping Canadians
            safe and protecting the environment and promoting efficient energy
            infrastructure and markets.

            Our regulatory toolkit has expanded to better allow us to enforce
            compliance with legislation, regulation, conditions and orders.
            Companies are expected to carefully design and implement management
            systems to effectively assess risk and continually improve their
            operations with the end goal of keeping people safe and protecting
            the environment. The toolkit, stemming from the

                >Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act</a

            >, includes an additional $13.5&nbsp;million to hire additional
            staff and improve safety programs, as well as legislative changes
            that give the NEB new authorities in its regulation such as the
            ability to issue Administrative Monetary Penalties. We have also
            amended the Board’s Onshore Pipeline Regulations and Processing
            Plant Regulations with new and stricter rules that will protect
            Canadians and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Safety and the protection of the environment continue to be our top
            priorities, and our efforts are headed in the right direction. The
            goal of zero incidents is not only the right goal, but an achievable
            goal. Overall in&nbsp;2013, we saw a decrease in reportable
            incidents. The frequency of natural gas releases was down, and while
            we saw an increase in the number of incidents with respect to
            liquids, overall release volumes were significantly down this year,
            and have been declining since&nbsp;2009. In&nbsp;2013, nearly all
            liquid releases from NEB-regulated energy facilities have been fully
            remediated, with exceptions only where cleanup is underway.
            Companies have been doing a better job of monitoring their
            facilities and reporting incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The facilities we regulate are safe and the environment in which
            they operate is well protected. At the same time, we are Canada’s
            energy watchdog and our work is never finished. We strive to
            continually improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            In June, the Board hosted a Safety Forum that facilitated dialogue
            among experts, academics, landowners, youth and leaders from both
            industry and regulators on safety management, continual improvement,
            and opportunities to improve safety outcomes. The broad takeaways
            from this forum were: a target of zero incidents is realistic;
            management systems, safety culture and measuring safety are the
            three fundamental ways to address pipeline safety; and we can never
            be satisfied that we have done all we can, but must embrace
            continual improvement. The Safety Forum was not the final step, but
            rather the latest step forward in our safety journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies regulated by the NEB are required to seek the Board’s
            approval for the export/import of energy, new construction or
            modification of energy infrastructure, tolls and tariffs, and
            abandonment. When a company applies to us, we take all aspects into
            consideration from environmental impacts to economic impacts and
            social considerations. In&nbsp;2013, we received nearly
            500&nbsp;applications, and issued just under 550&nbsp;decisions on
            imports and exports, as well as 18&nbsp;hearing
            recommendations/decisions for energy infrastructure (new and/or
            modified), tolls and tariffs and abandonment. As part of those
            18&nbsp;recommendations/decisions, the NEB also this year, under the
            Joint Review Panel appointed under the

            The public actively engage with us on processes that lead to the
            Board’s decisions, recommendations and direction. This past year we
            conducted over 100 engagement activities for both regulatory
            applications and non-application initiatives, including over 50
            meetings across the North. This also included activities under our
            Enhanced Aboriginal Engagement initiative. We work in the public
            interest so it is critical that we directly involve Canadians in our
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is particularly true in the North. Engaging meaningfully with
            Northerners in developing a robust regulatory framework in the North
            is of great importance to the Board. This past summer Members of the
            Board along with NEB staff travelled to the Mackenzie Delta as well
            as communities in the Beaufort Sea and Baffin Island. These trips
            were not just about learning how energy development is perceived in
            this area of Canada. It was also about learning from the local
            communities in order to better understand the Northern way of life
            and the impacts development could have. This first-hand knowledge is
            important to ensure the Board is doing the right thing with respect
            to reviewing and strengthening a regulatory framework that focuses
            on safety and environmental protection in the North.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the dynamic nature of the energy sector in Canada, the Board
            continues to monitor the relationships between supply,
            infrastructure, demand and prices. When reviewing an application for
            an export licence, the Board considers whether the quantity to be
            exported is surplus to Canadian needs. In Canada, we are seeing an
            increasing demand for energy. At the same time, production and
            supply are increasing at a faster rate which results in larger
            amounts of surplus energy available for export. In&nbsp;2013,
            NEB-regulated facilities shipped approximately $134.4&nbsp;billion
            worth of products (liquids and gas) to Canadian and export
            customers, and approximately $2.7&nbsp;billion of electricity went
            into and out of Canada. Even with exporting that amount of energy,
            we still have more than enough to meet the needs of Canadians.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is much to be proud of in&nbsp;2013, and the Annual Report
            highlights our activities and areas of focus. The NEB’s story is one
            about continual improvement and always looking to be better - and it
            is this ongoing evolution that I know will be the constant in the
            Board’s future as Canada’s energy regulator.

          <p>
            The National Energy Board (NEB or Board) is an
            <a href="/bts/whwr/index-eng.html">independent federal regulator</a>
            established in 1959. Our mandate is to promote safety and security,
            environmental protection and economic efficiency in the Canadian
            public interest, in the regulation of pipelines, energy development
            and trade. The Board reports to Parliament through the Minister of
            Natural Resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2013, the NEB regulated 98 companies, which operate
            approximately 73,000&nbsp;kilometres<sup
              ><a href="#ftn2back" id="ftn2">[2]</a></sup
            >
            of interprovincial and international pipelines, and related tolls

            The main responsibilities of the NEB are established in the

            />On 3&nbsp;July&nbsp;2013, new provisions of the NEB Act
            (sections&nbsp;134 to&nbsp;154) came into effect that establishes a
            system of AMPs to promote compliance with the NEB Act. The NEB Act
            stipulates that <em>each&nbsp;day</em> that a violation continues is
            considered to be a <em>separate</em> violation. This means that
            separate penalties could be issued per infraction, per day with no
            maximum total financial penalty. The NEB Act also sets out the
            maximum daily penalties: for companies, the maximum daily penalty is
            $100,000 per violation; and for individuals, the maximum daily
            penalty is $25,000 for each violation. The Board has conducted an
            extensive outreach program around AMPs and feedback received from
            stakeholders indicates that AMPs are a powerful deterrent.

            June&nbsp;5<sup>th </sup>and&nbsp;6<sup>th</sup> in Calgary,
            Alberta. Over the course of the event, 20&nbsp;speakers ranging from
            Chief Executive Officers to subject matter experts, presented
            information through panel discussions and keynote sessions. The
            Forum was attended by 385&nbsp;participants representing the public,
            Aboriginal peoples, industry, consultants, academia, government, NEB
            representatives and youth.

            strengthen public trust, the role of energy sector leadership in
            safety, public expectations around transparency of information, and
            the evolving role of the regulator as it strives to continually

            In October&nbsp;2013, the NEB attended the International Regulators’
            Forum’s (IRF)<sup><a href="#ftn5back" id="ftn5">[5]</a></sup>
            biennial conference and meeting held in Perth, Australia, and was
            enrolled as a part of a reconstituted Canadian membership. The NEB
            represents Canada on a rotational basis with the
            <em>Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board</em>
            and the <em>Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board</em>. The
            NEB is providing its expertise for the advancement of understanding
            and awareness of the key role that safety culture plays in
            preventing major accidents across the industry. During the event the
            three Canadian Boards shared their

            The NEB is an active member of the North American regulatory
            community, collaborating on regulatory practices, sharing findings
            and regulatory perspectives and providing information on industry
            trends. The NEB has MOUs with numerous agencies within the
            Provincial, Federal and International communities. The NEB is also a
            member of <em>Canada’s Energy and Utility Regulators</em> (CAMPUT).
            Currently, the NEB is working with Canada’s two Offshore Petroleum
            Boards to propose a common draft of a definition and framework for
            Safety Culture. The discussion paper, released in October,

            emerging discipline of Safety Culture across the oil and gas sector
            in Canada. This effort is intended to develop better aligned
            regulatory requirements to promote a strong safety culture in the
            oil and gas industry.

          <p class="text-info h3 mrgn-tp-lg">Safety Culture</p>
          <p>
            Culture influences what people see, hear, feel, and say. Perhaps
            more importantly, it influences the decisions, actions and
            behaviours of people in an organization. These behaviours ultimately
            drive safety outcomes and performance.
          </p>
          <p>A strong safety culture is one in which:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              leaders demonstrate that safety is their overriding value and
              priority;
            </li>
            <li>
              everyone is aware of known hazards while remaining vigilant to new
              threats;
            </li>
            <li>
              every employee feels empowered and rewarded for making safe
              decisions;
            </li>
            <li>
              employees feel encouraged to report safety hazards, including
              instances where they have committed an error and introduced a
              threat themselves;
            </li>
            <li>
              the most junior employee would not hesitate to take action in
              response to a safety concern without fear of disciplinary action
              or reprisal;
            </li>
            <li>
              the supervisor does not have to be present for someone to do the
              right thing; and
            </li>
            <li>
              the organization is continually learning from its own and others’
              experiences with the goal of advancing safety.

            Strong leadership is key to establishing, fostering and maintaining
            a healthy safety culture. The attitudes of executive and senior
            management, their actions and decisions serve to shape corporate
            culture. Leadership uses its management systems’ policies,
            priorities, processes, and procedures to formally communicate its
            values and expectations. Through these mechanisms, executive
            management establishes the initial framework of the corporate
            culture. Where an organization is strongly in tune with establishing
            and maintaining a positive safety culture, it scrutinizes, as a
            normal business function, every decision to ensure that risk is
            considered and managed appropriately. The Board is committed to
            supporting safety culture. This was a key topic discussed during the
            Safety Forum in June&nbsp;2013, as well as being the focus of the
            Board’s discussion paper

          <p class="text-info h4 mrgn-tp-lg">Management Systems</p>
          <p>
            Carefully designed and well-implemented management systems are
            essential to keep people safe and protect the environment.
            Management systems include the necessary organizational structures,
            resources, accountabilities, policies and procedures to effectively
            manage risks and continually improve operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            An effective management system has elements to identify potential
            hazards, manage risks, train and supervise workers and contractors,
            communicate, manage records and documentation, monitor and evaluate
            progress, and continually improve performance. This provides a
            consistent framework for the cyclical planning, implementation,
            review and adjustment of operational activities, which is essential
            for a company to manage its human and financial resources
            appropriately to achieve desired safety outcomes.

            The NEB has identified three outcomes for regulated companies: the
            safety and security of the public and company employees; the
            protection of the environment and property; and the safety and
            security of infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            A company’s management system should complement protection programs
            (integrity, safety, environmental protection, damage prevention,
            emergency management, and security) and should be proportionate to
            the size and risk of the assets being protected and activities
            performed. It is intended to be scalable, so that it can be used
            appropriately by both small operators and large companies.

          <p>
            Through its Emergency Management (EM) Program, the NEB focuses on
            overseeing the EM programs of its regulated companies. Since
            April&nbsp;2012, the NEB has been working with the Canadian
            Standards Association (CSA) and emergency management experts to
            draft a preparedness and response standard (CSA&nbsp;Z246.2 -
            <em
              >Emergency preparedness and response for petroleum and natural gas
              industry systems</em
            >). The standard is expected to be published in&nbsp;2014. NEB staff
            also continue to participate on the CSA&nbsp;Z1600 (<em
              >Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs</em
            >) Technical Committee. CSA&nbsp;Z1600 applies to public and private
            organizations of all sizes, and covers prevention, mitigation,
            preparedness, response and recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late&nbsp;2012, the CSA proposed that a Damage Prevention
            Standard be developed for Canadian underground infrastructure. The
            Technical Committee for CSA&nbsp;Z247 -
            <em
              >Damage Prevention for the Protection of Underground Energy and
              Utility Infrastructure</em
            >
            was formed in February of&nbsp;2013. The committee membership
            consists of the NEB, representatives of the oil and gas and
            construction industries, landowners, locators, one-call centres, and
            other governments, who all provide technical support in the
            development of the standard. This standard will outline the key
            elements (e.g. minimum requirements, guidance, and best practices)
            that, when consistently applied, will reduce damage to all buried
            infrastructure and significantly enhance public safety. The Draft
            Standard will also strive to meet public safety expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB continues to strongly support excellence in emergency
            management and damage prevention through direct participation of
            staff on standards development committees. NEB staff work with other

            regulations, standards adopted into regulation, directives and
            orders of the Board, and conditions of certificates and orders. The
            Board uses CVAs to verify that all known non-compliances have been
            corrected and to gather new information about the state of
            compliance in a specific area of a company’s operations or to
            investigate whether the NEB’s regulated companies are taking the

          <p>
            The Board’s objective for enforcement actions is to achieve
            compliance as quickly and as effectively as possible. Achieving
            compliance reduces hazards and protects the safety of workers and
            the public, the environment and property. The NEB’s guiding
            enforcement policy statement is the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >The NEB will enforce regulatory requirements to
              <strong>obtain compliance</strong>,
              <strong>deter future non-compliance</strong>, and
              <strong>prevent harm</strong> by using the most appropriate tool
              or tools available.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            NEB enforcement tools are not mutually exclusive and more than one
            measure may be employed to obtain compliance, deter future
            non-compliance or to prevent incidents/accidents. When safety,
            security or environmental protection issues are identified, the NEB
            will use the most appropriate and efficient enforcement tool,
            including issuance of a Notice of Non-Compliance (NNC), Inspection
            Officer Order (IOO), Safety Order, AMPs, or taking the matter
            forward for Prosecution, or Revoking the Authorization.

          </ul>
          <p>
            The most common findings of non-compliance were in the areas of
            sediment and erosion control/containment; and inadequate
            labelling/signage or site clean-up. In one instance, as an example,
            the Board issued an NNC when environmental inspections identified
            reclamation and site clean-up as issues following a company’s
            operation and maintenance activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Board always investigates issues with respect to its
            regulated companies, to date, the NEB has not had to use AMPs,
            revoke a certificate or prosecute a regulated company in order to
            obtain compliance with its acts and regulations. This outcome is
            consistent with the Board’s objective for gaining compliance as
            quickly and effectively as possible.

            The NEB enforces regulatory requirements using the most appropriate
            tool or tools available, such as Safety Orders, in order to obtain
            compliance, deter future non-compliance, and prevent harm. The NEB
            publishes compliance and enforcement documents on its website.

          <p>
            Pipeline safety and the protection of the environment are top of
            mind for Canadians. The Board has observed an increase in the number
            of LVP (liquid) releases this past year, from two in&nbsp;2012 to
            nine in&nbsp;2013, however the total volume of releases has
            significantly declined as shown in Figure&nbsp;4. There have been a
            total of 31&nbsp;liquid releases since&nbsp;2009.

            Liquid hydrocarbon spills can be a significant hazard to people and
            the environment if uncontained. In recent years, the NEB has
            significantly increased its compliance verification activities in
            pursuit of its goal of zero incidents. In&nbsp;2013, the Board
            completed four audits and 169 inspections on pipeline systems. The
            NEB also clarified its enforcement policy and increased the number
            of enforcement actions it has taken. Numerous Board Orders and
            Letters of Direction have been imposed on companies to ensure swift
            and effective action on non-compliances.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Board actions have directly affected how companies are
            operating their pipelines and the way companies are approaching the
            safety of their systems and the results are moving in the right
            direction. There has been a decreasing trend in the volume of liquid
            hydrocarbon spilled from NEB-regulated pipelines since&nbsp;2009.
            In&nbsp;2013, nearly all liquid releases from NEB-regulated energy
            facilities have been fully remediated. The exceptions are those
            where cleanup is underway. This data shows that the Board and
            industry are on the right path to continuously improve outcomes in
            safety and environmental protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who is discovering pipeline releases is an important question. The
            Board requires companies to manage and carefully monitor their
            systems and as a result should be the first to detect any
            inconsistency in their operations. Over the five-year period
            from&nbsp;2008 to&nbsp;2013, 92&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent (37) of releases
            were reported by the regulated company or one of their contractors,
            five per cent (two) were reported by landowners and three per cent
            (one) were reported by members of the public. In&nbsp;2013,
            100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of releases were reported by companies.

            100&nbsp;m&sup3;. There has not been a spill greater than
            100&nbsp;m&sup3; since&nbsp;2011. One of the releases occurred on
            the pipeline right-of-way, and was discovered while the reporting
            company was undertaking an integrity dig. The other eight releases
            occurred on station property and were fully contained. The products
            released in&nbsp;2013 included crude oil, condensate and other
            products (e.g.&nbsp;lube and heating oil).
          </p>

            The majority (approximately 90&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) of HVP (gas)
            releases in&nbsp;2013 involve sweet natural gas. There has been an
            overall decrease in the number of HVP product releases
            from&nbsp;2012 to&nbsp;2013, down from&nbsp;70 to&nbsp;56.

            The Board’s enhanced regulatory requirements and actions are driving
            increasing diligence on the part of companies in the monitoring of
            their facilities. This diligence on both sides will lead towards the
            goal of zero incidents.

            Death or Serious Injury to a Person
          </p>
          <p>
            The safety of those who build and operate energy infrastructure
            regulated by the NEB is of paramount importance to the Board.
            In&nbsp;2013, there were two serious injuries and one fatality. One
            serious injury incident involved burns due to the ignition of gas
            when a pipe was being welded, and the second resulted from a vehicle
            rollover. The same vehicle rollover also resulted in a fatality
            incident. In the last five&nbsp;years, fatalities have averaged one
            per year, and are mainly related to the use of motorized vehicles
            off the pipeline right-of-way (RoW). The NEB is working with
            companies to resolve this safety concern. As a result, companies are
            focusing their training on ensuring people get home safely as part
            of ongoing safety culture work.

          <p class="text-info h4 mrgn-tp-lg">Unintended Fires / Explosions</p>
          <p>
            This year there were 14&nbsp;fires and no explosions, down from
            39&nbsp;fires and five explosions in&nbsp;2012. The reported
            explosions in&nbsp;2012 all involved batteries exploding, causing
            either small fires or smoke, or the release of battery acid within
            company property. Prior to&nbsp;2013, the Board observed an increase
            in the number of fires and explosions. These incidents, including
            those in&nbsp;2013, are mainly the result of the following issues:
            equipment and electrical failures, battery-related explosions,
            welding, housekeeping (e.g.&nbsp;unorganized workspaces) and natural
            events (e.g.&nbsp;lightning strikes). Several incidents in&nbsp;2013
            remain open and are under investigation, therefore causes have not
            yet been determined.

            It is important to note that while the majority of these incidents
            are considered minor in nature, meaning an incident that has been
            contained and/or is small, the NEB takes them quite seriously and
            has taken actions to further prevent future incidents. The Board’s
            CVAs this year included activities, such as safety orders, audits
            and subsequent inspections, to address the trend in fires and
            explosions.

          <p class="text-info h4 mrgn-tp-lg">Operation Beyond Design Limits</p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2013, there were 15 &quot;operation beyond design
            limits&quot; incidents reported to the Board. These types of
            incidents include events such as overpressures, vibration beyond
            design limits, slope movements, and introduction of an inappropriate
            product (e.g.,&nbsp;sour gas in excess of CSA limits). Of the
            15&nbsp;incidents this past year, 12 were related to overpressures,
            two were due to inappropriate product entering the system and one
            was due to slope movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            In April&nbsp;2012, the Board issued a Safety Advisory to all its
            regulated companies (NEB-SA-2012-01) which provided information on
            preventive actions for operation beyond design limits of their
            energy infrastructure. The Board follows up on every incident that
            is reported. Due to several overpressure incidents, the Board issued
            a Safety Order to Enbridge Pipelines Inc. in&nbsp;2013. The NEB,
            based on its follow-up, will continue to monitor and take action as
            appropriate.

            Although this data only includes O&amp;M activities where advance
            notification is required, it is clear that companies are conducting
            more O&amp;M activities and, therefore, are looking more closely at
            their pipelines. This increased activity is being driven in part by
            the increase in Safety Orders issued by the Board requiring better
            investigation of pipeline anomalies, as well as the need to justify
            to the Board in applications that existing pipe is fit for service
            under modified operating conditions. In addition, companies are
            taking more accountability to prevent incidents, improving their
            management systems and safety culture.

          <p>
            The NEB also has regulatory responsibilities for oil and gas
            exploration and production activities under the
            <em>Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act</em> (COGOA). These include
            responsibilities for frontier lands that are not otherwise regulated

            Territories, Nunavut, Arctic offshore, Hudson Bay, West Coast
            offshore, Gulf of St. Lawrence, a portion of the Bay of Fundy and
            onshore Sable Island.
          </p>
          <p>The regulation under COGOA defines &quot;incident&quot; as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              any event that causes a lost or restricted workday injury, death,
              fire or explosion, a loss of containment from a well, an imminent

            The NEB has followed up on all incidents reported to it under this
            Act. As per COGOA, companies must undertake measures to prevent
            future incidents, repair or remedy any condition resulting from an
            incident, and take steps to reduce or mitigate any danger to life,
            health, the environment or property. The NEB will not consider
            clean-up to be complete until it is satisfied that there has been
            full remediation of the site of all environmental effects.

            The data indicates that ground disturbance, or excavation
            activities, is the most prevalent UA. Encroachment activities
            generally consist of stockpiling fill or sand, and building sheds,
            skating rinks or above ground pools on the pipeline right-of-way.
            Vehicle crossing refers to vehicles or construction equipment
            operating on or across the right-of-way without permission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone involved must work to reduce unauthorized activities, with
            the ultimate goal of seeing none at all. The number of reported
            unauthorized activities fluctuates from year to year due to a number
            of factors. The number may grow as development and construction
            activity increases around pipelines. Unsafe excavation and
            construction practices can cause damage and put the safety of people
            and the environment at risk. Focused compliance and enforcement
            activities by the NEB have increased awareness and compliance for
            companies with respect to reporting requirements. Knowing where to
            &quot;dig&quot; and how to do it safely, are important subjects as
            everyone must work together to reduce UAs.

            <li>
              A failure of downhole injection well equipment in a storage cavern
              at the Plains Midstream Canada ULC terminal at Windsor, ON. There
              was no off-site release, no environmental damages, no injuries and
              the hydrocarbon release was immediately contained.
            </li>
            <li>
              A hydrocarbon release occurred on a multi-company right-of-way
              near Sarnia, ON. The Board responded, but it was subsequently
              determined that the release occurred from an adjacent pipeline
              under provincial jurisdiction. The Board aided the provincial
              regulator in securing the site.
            </li>
            <li>
              A hydrocarbon release was detected during an integrity dig on
              Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC’s Mainline pipeline near Merritt, BC.
              The release was contained within the right-of-way and the line was
              shut down. The release did not result in a fire, injuries or
              impacts to the environment. The estimated volume of oil released
              was approximately 0.8&nbsp;m&sup3;.

              A hydrocarbon release was detected during an integrity dig on
              Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC’s Mainline pipeline near Hope, BC. The
              Board has noted that there was some subsurface contamination, and
              impacts to groundwater are being assessed in detail. The release
              did not result in a fire, injuries or impacts to the environment.
              The estimated volume of oil released was approximately
              4&nbsp;m&sup3;.
            </li>
            <li>
              A rupture occurred on Nova Gas Transmission Ltd.’s North Central
              Corridor pipeline near a remote area west of Fort McMurray. An
              Inspection Officer Order was issued placing a pressure restriction

            application from Black Pearl Resources to construct and operate
            Central SK-AB PW Disposal Pipeline that would cross federal lands.
            The project involved the construction of 100&nbsp;metres of pipeline
            to transport produced water from existing and proposed production
            and gathering facilities in Saskatchewan to an existing produced

            >Canadians depend on the pipeline transportation system for a safe,
            reliable and efficient energy supply, now and in the future. The
            ability of this system to deliver natural gas, natural gas liquids
            (NGLs), crude oil, and petroleum products is also critical to
            Canada’s economy. The NEB is active and effective in Canada’s
            pursuit of a sustainable energy future by integrating at the same
            time relevant economic, environmental and social considerations when
            choosing a course of action.

            The NEB’s regulatory framework is designed to promote safety,
            security, environmental protection and efficient energy
            infrastructure and markets. Requirements encourage innovation where
            possible but also specify mandatory design, operational practices or
            management methods when necessary. The regulatory framework supports
            a sustainable energy system that will meet Canadians’ needs today,
            while taking into consideration the needs of Canadians tomorrow.

          <p>
            The NEB regulates and considers issues of design, construction,
            operation and abandonment of energy infrastructure facilities. In
            other words, the Board regulates from &quot;start to finish&quot;,
            and holds pipeline companies responsible for the full life cycle of
            the pipelines they operate.

          <p>
            In May&nbsp;2009, the NEB released a decision directing all
            NEB-regulated companies to begin setting aside abandonment funds and
            set out a five-year Action Plan in that regard. The five-year Action
            Plan contains steps which will facilitate the setting-aside and
            reporting on funds by&nbsp;2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            The five-year Action Plan is on track. In November&nbsp;2011, all
            large regulated pipeline companies and many smaller ones filed their
            initial estimates of costs to abandon their pipelines. On
            14&nbsp;February&nbsp;2013, the NEB approved the abandonment cost
            estimates of 12 of the 13&nbsp;large regulated pipeline companies as
            filed, subject to numerous directions specific to each company. One
            large company, Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline Management Ltd.,
            was not a part of this process because it followed the NEB’s
            previously released base case for abandonment cost estimates and
            therefore did not require Board approval. The NEB will hold an oral
            hearing in early&nbsp;2014 with respect to how abandonment-related
            funds will be collected and how the funds will be set-aside and
            managed by &quot;Group&nbsp;1&quot;<sup

            On 27&nbsp;March&nbsp;2013, the NEB announced its decision to fix
            multi-year tolls on the TransCanada Mainline. In its application,
            TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TransCanada) asked the Board to
            consider restructured pipeline services and tolling across its
            pipeline network, which includes the Mainline, the Alberta System
            and the Foothills System. The Board approved multi-year fixed tolls
            that are competitive and provide TransCanada with a reasonable
            opportunity to recover its Mainline costs, given the increase in
            Mainline throughput that is forecast. Please see the NEB’s website

            Service standards are an essential tool in today’s results-based

            standards for many regulatory functions and services. The Board
            communicates to the public and stakeholders the expected timeline in
            which an application or request will be processed, having due regard
            to the assessment it must carry out to fulfill the NEB’s mandate as
            stipulated in the legislation.

            Participation of Aboriginal Groups in the Regulatory Process

            />We are committed to ensuring that appropriate engagement is
            carried out for projects where there is a potential impact on the
            rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples. The Board’s Enhanced
            Aboriginal Engagement (EAE) initiative aims to provide proactive
            contact with Aboriginal groups that may be affected by a proposed
            project, and to help Aboriginal groups understand the Board’s
            regulatory process as well as how to participate in that process.
            In&nbsp;2013, under the EAE initiative, we contacted nearly 188
            Aboriginal communities and organizations, and held 19&nbsp;meetings
            with interested Aboriginal communities and organizations. These
            meetings provided an opportunity for Aboriginal representatives to
            ask questions and provide feedback about NEB processes directly to
            NEB staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an effort to make public hearings more accessible to Aboriginal
            people, the NEB adapts its processes to assist interested Aboriginal
            groups so they may effectively participate. The Board continues to
            integrate Aboriginal ceremonies and traditional practices into a
            hearing process at the request of Aboriginal participants.
            Suggestions made by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal hearing
            participants are considered in choosing hearing location and timing
            in order to make the hearing as accessible as possible. For example,
            during the Joint Review Panel’s Northern Gateway Project hearing,
            remote participation during the oral hearings was made available
            through the use of telephone and video links. Often, hearings were
            held in Aboriginal communities. The Panel sought, in particular, to
            hear from Aboriginal groups in a manner that was responsive to, and
            respectful of, Aboriginal traditions.

            The NEB makes decisions/recommendations in the public interest,
            which is why the participation process is so essential. We recognize
            the importance of hearing from the people who have a stake in a
            proposed facility project. More specifically, the Board will hear
            from people who stand to be directly affected by a proposed project,
            and may hear from those who have information and expertise that
            could help the hearing panel gain a greater understanding of a given

          <p>
            Section&nbsp;55.2 of the NEB Act sets out when the Board will allow

            about the project for the Board to consider, or c) both.

            Safety During the Public Hearing Process
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the goals of our public hearing process is to hear from those
            directly affected by a proposed project. We work tirelessly to
            provide a safe and respectful environment to ensure a broad range of
            perspectives are incorporated into our decisions. Safety is always
            our first priority - safety of hearing participants and the general
            public who attend our hearings. As part of this commitment, we
            conduct a security assessment on a hearing location prior to any
            hearing, and would look at things such as publicly available
            information to assess any prior planned events that may have an
            impact on a venue. We work with local officials and federal
            colleagues such as the RCMP to conduct the assessment. We also look
            to the <em>Canada Labour Code</em> to ensure we are meeting all
            requirements for a safe public hearing. We use this information to
            ensure that plans are in place to protect everyone participating,
            for example the placement of security officers, emergency evacuation
            plans or online participation, etc. Part of regulating in the public
            interest is to hear from the public, and providing a safe
            environment is crucial in following through on that purpose.

          <p>
            The Land Matters Group (LMG) was established by the Board to
            increase the dialogue amongst members of the public, Aboriginal
            groups and industry who have an interest in land matters and are
            impacted by the activities of NEB-regulated companies. The list of

            Ontario Indians, Canadian Federation of Agriculture, The Canadian
            Energy Pipeline Association, West Coast Environmental Law, Synergy
            Alberta, The Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, Metis National
            Council and the NEB. Members participate in a variety of ways

            The LMG Steering Committee met twice in&nbsp;2013 - once in

            Therefore, net exports averaged approximately
            155&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;/day, which is similar to&nbsp;2012.
            In&nbsp;2013, the value of natural gas exports is estimated at
            C$11.1&nbsp;billion. The value of natural gas imports is estimated
            at C$3.9&nbsp;billion.

            (CEO) is also published which provides an analysis of energy markets
            and trends from the previous year. The 2012&nbsp;CEO noted that
            domestic energy production increased by about
            two&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, with growth in petroleum partially offset by
            a decline in natural gas production. At the same time, domestic
            energy consumption grew slightly in all categories, and overall by
            1.1&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in&nbsp;2012.

            (EF&nbsp;2013). The results indicated that there will be adequate
            supply to meet Canada’s growing energy needs over the forecast
            period. In&nbsp;2013, energy production levels were projected to
            exceed domestic requirements, resulting in growing amounts of energy

            Canadian energy needs will increase as well, but at a slower rate

            As stated in the report, the Montney Formation is one of the largest
            natural gas resources in the world. Recent advances in technology
            have made it possible to economically develop unconventional gas and
            oil in the Montney Formation over the past several years, but little
            had been known about its total potential. When combined with what is
            known about the marketable gas potential from conventional resources
            and other unconventional resources, it is expected that Canadian gas
            markets will remain well supplied into the future.

            NEB is a Top&nbsp;100 Employer in Canada!
          </p>
          <p>
            In October of&nbsp;2013, the NEB was again named as one of Canada’s
            Top&nbsp;100 Employers for&nbsp;2014 for the fourth&nbsp;year in a
            row (the NEB is a five-time&nbsp;winner as we were also named
            in&nbsp;2009). In addition to that honour, we were also named as one
            of Canada’s Top&nbsp;100 Family Friendly Employers for&nbsp;2014, a
            designation that recognizes employers offering progressive and
            forward-thinking programs for employees with young children, other
            dependents, and/or family responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is pleased to receive these honours as they showcase not
            only the types of programs offered to employees; they also focus on
            the employees themselves. The NEB is not just a Top&nbsp;100
            Employer and Family Friendly Employer; it is a &quot;Top&nbsp;100
            Team&quot; that strives for excellence in all that it does.

            In June&nbsp;2009, Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI) took legal
            action against Lynx Canada Information Systems Ltd. (Lynx) in the
            Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench for copyright infringement relating
            to geophysical information and related relief. On
            27&nbsp;May&nbsp;2011, Lynx brought a Third Party Claim against the
            National Energy Board. On 30&nbsp;October&nbsp;2012, GSI filed an
            Amended Statement of Claim naming the NEB directly as a defendant
            for the full amount of its claim. On 18&nbsp;July&nbsp;2013, the NEB
            filed a Statement of Defence. The file is presently ongoing.

            On 16&nbsp;September&nbsp;2011, Altagas Ltd. filed with the Federal
            Court of Appeal a Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal of the NEB
            letter decision and Order&nbsp;TG-05-2011 dated
            19&nbsp;August&nbsp;2011, approving Implementation of Alberta System
            Integration. On&nbsp;19 September&nbsp;2011, BP Canada Energy
            Company filed with the Federal Court of Appeal a Notice of Motion
            for Leave to Appeal the same NEB decision and Order. The Court
            granted both Motions on 10&nbsp;November&nbsp;2011. The appeals were
            discontinued by the appellants in January 2013.

                  <p>
                    I am pleased to present the National Energy Board (NEB or
                    the Board) 2015 Annual Report to Parliament.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The past year has been a period of unprecedented change for
                    the Board. We have laid the groundwork for an ambitious
                    modernization that will enable the Board to provide what
                    Canadians expect and deserve: a fair, transparent and
                    respectful regulator that delivers timely, high-quality
                    results.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During 2015, I travelled across Canada as part of the NEB’s
                    National Engagement Initiative, attending 80&nbsp;meetings
                    in 34&nbsp;cities and towns in nine&nbsp;provinces and two
                    territories. What I learned had a profound impact on me and
                    how I see the NEB doing its work in the future. Canadians
                    told us clearly that they want to be a part of the energy
                    dialogue, and want accessible and transparent information
                    about safe energy regulation in our country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The NEB responded with increased stakeholder engagement,
                    both within and outside of the adjudication processes. We
                    established two regional offices in Montréal and Vancouver,
                    in addition to our offices in Yellowknife and Inuvik, to
                    ramp up our community-based and regional focus. This has
                    positioned the NEB to work on building stronger, renewed
                    relationships with regional leaders, landowners,
                    environmental groups and Indigenous Peoples. We will
                    continue to adopt new and innovative approaches to provide
                    more meaningful opportunities for public participation in
                    NEB hearing processes, and to provide Canadians with
                    appropriate avenues of engagement with the NEB outside of
                    hearings.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>
                    We have also taken steps to be more transparent, and to help
                    Canadians better understand what we do every day. In the
                    past year, we have added to our online Safety Performance
                    Portal with an online interactive Pipeline Incident Map that
                    offers Canadians the opportunity to view all pipeline
                    incidents since 2008. We have begun publishing pipeline
                    company field inspection reports online. We continue to
                    focus on data collection and analysis, both to learn from
                    past incidents and reduce future incidents, and to make more
                    information about company pipeline safety performance
                    available to the public.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A key aspect of the NEB’s mandate is to study energy matters
                    over which parliament has jurisdiction, and to provide the
                    government with advice on those issues. With the growing
                    volatility and uncertainty in our energy markets, the need
                    has never been greater for Canadians and policy makers to
                    get objective, fact-based information on Canada’s energy
                    system. The NEB is responding by providing more open,
                    forward-looking energy data and information, both online and
                    through our energy markets publications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Demonstrating regulatory leadership will improve public
                    confidence in the NEB’s ability to fulfill its mandate, as
                    well as facilitate stronger coordination and cooperation
                    with our territorial, provincial, federal, and international
                    counterparts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regulatory excellence is not a static achievement but a
                    perpetual pursuit. It is dynamic by nature. The NEB actively
                    anticipates and embraces all feedback - whether sourced from
                    external audits, stakeholders or our own internal management
                    systems – as a part of our goal to lead regulatory
                    excellence. The organization’s responsibilities are informed
                    by a wide array of factors, including emerging industry
                    developments, the proactive consideration of safety,
                    environmental, societal, and economic trends that shape the
                    Canadian public interest. We are already a strong regulator,
                    and we will continue to improve our work to respond to our
                    changing environment.

                    The National Energy Board is Canada’s energy and safety
                    regulator. We do not simply make a decision on a project and
                    then walk away. We oversee safety for the full lifecycle of
                    energy facilities — from design and application assessment
                    to construction, operation and abandonment. We work
                    alongside communities and share the same goal of making
                    energy infrastructure the very safest it can be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The staff of the National Energy Board is made up of highly
                    skilled employees, including engineers, environmental
                    specialists, auditors, inspectors, engagement staff, legal
                    and administrative specialists, and others. We are proud of
                    the work we do protecting the interests of Canadians.
                    Whether it’s managing public hearings, building a better
                    website, recruiting talented new employees or walking
                    pipelines conducting inspections - we know our work makes a
                    difference in keeping Canadians safe, the environment
                    protected and energy infrastructure reliable.

                  <p>
                    In order for the Board to effectively serve Canadians, we
                    know they need to have confidence in the regulatory regime

                    and believe in the Board’s ability to enforce the orders,
                    rules and regulations that are in place to protect
                    Canadians, their communities and their environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our work goes beyond approving projects and penalizing those
                    who don’t follow our rules. We are here to serve the public.
                    We want to make certain that Canadians know they have a
                    regulator they can rely on, because the Canadian public
                    interest is at the heart of everything we do.

                  <p>
                    In order to achieve our core mandate, the Board has outlined
                    three strategic priorities where we will:

                      continue to strategically develop, refine and communicate

                      protection

                    The National Energy Board is an independent federal
                    regulator established in 1959. Our mandate is to promote
                    safety and security, environmental protection and economic
                    efficiency in the Canadian public interest, in the
                    regulation of pipelines, energy development and trade. The
                    Board reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural
                    Resources. In 2015, the NEB regulated approximately
                    73,000&nbsp;kilometres (km) of interprovincial and
                    international pipelines along with approximately
                    1,400&nbsp;kilometres of international power lines across
                    Canada. The pipelines,

                    approximately $3.4&nbsp;billion of electricity into and out

                    The Board regulates Canada’s federal energy infrastructure
                    over its complete lifecycle. During the design and
                    applications assessment phase of projects, we review and
                    impose conditions. When approved projects are being built
                    and operated, we inspect and audit them. And, when a
                    pipeline has reached the end of its usefulness, we review
                    abandonment applications to ensure that it is abandoned in a
                    safe and environmentally responsible manner.

                    In other words, the Board regulates from “start to finish”,

                    In the first half of 2015, the National Energy Board
                    conducted a National Engagement Initiative. Energy
                    infrastructure, and the NEB’s role as the federal regulator,
                    had been under growing scrutiny in the past several years,
                    and the Board determined that in order to understand the
                    issues facing the NEB, we had to reach out directly to the
                    public. We asked Canadians to tell us what was most
                    important to them about the work that we did, and how they
                    felt we could adjust our pipeline safety program, public
                    engagement activities and communications.

                    broad and varied a selection of people as possible to hear
                    about their thoughts and concerns. Meetings were held with

                    chiefs and band councils, environmental groups, first
                    responders and academics, as well as professional and
                    industry organizations. Over a five-month period, the NEB
                    attended 80 meetings, in 34&nbsp;towns and cities across
                    nine provinces and two territories.

                    The National Engagement Initiative was new territory for the
                    NEB, unprecedented in the history of the regulator. It
                    signaled a change in tone for how we interacted with
                    Canadians. Over the course of the meetings, common themes
                    emerged:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Without exception, every person’s first priority is the
                      protection of their local and regional environment –
                      especially water systems and land – from negative effects
                      and risks of energy infrastructure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Stakeholders clearly said that they want a two-way
                      conversation with the NEB and industry, where not only can
                      they say what is on their mind, but also receive assurance
                      that they are being heard and that their concerns are
                      being acted on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Stakeholders also questioned whether regional emergency
                      management systems would work properly when needed. They
                      realized that this was a shared responsibility of
                      municipal first responders, industry, other levels of
                      government and emergency management agencies, but were not
                      confident the system parts were fully aligned and working
                      together.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                  <p>
                    The initiative put the NEB face-to-face with Canadians who
                    expressed their concerns, and offered regional insight and
                    perspectives related to pipelines and energy production.
                    Ultimately, we learned that there was a need for the NEB to
                    build greater public confidence through improved
                    transparency. Canadians deserve to have more information
                    regarding our role, company performance and what, if any,
                    impacts they might experience due to energy infrastructure
                    near them.

                  <p>
                    The NEB is not done with engaging Canadians. Rather, the
                    Engagement Initiative was meant to be the beginning of a new
                    and different kind of conversation with our stakeholders,
                    and also serve as an impetus for action. Now that we have
                    heard feedback on what Canadians want and need from the NEB,
                    we are taking action to respond in a meaningful way. For a

                    The NEB regulates pipelines, energy development and trade in
                    the Canadian public interest. The public interest is
                    inclusive of all Canadians and refers to a balance of
                    economic, environmental and social considerations that

                    Public participation is an important element of an open and
                    effective regulatory process. Under the NEB Act, the Board

                  <p>
                    The NEB administers a Participant Funding Program (PFP) that
                    provides modest funding to facilitate the participation of
                    individuals, Indigenous peoples (First Nations, the Métis
                    and the Inuit), and non-industry not-for-profit
                    organizations in hearings with respect to new or abandonment
                    projects for pipelines or powerlines. PFP was established in
                    2010, and expanded in June 2015 to include Environmental
                    Assessments of designated projects as per the
                    <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</em>
                    (CEAA&nbsp;2012) Regulations Designating Physical
                    Activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the PFP was introduced in 2010, the NEB has announced
                    more than $11.5&nbsp;million for participation in
                    19&nbsp;eligible public hearings. To date,
                    $5.57&nbsp;million in funding was awarded to 171 recipients
                    which represents 13 of the hearings. Among those who had
                    applied, approximately 80&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the funding
                    was awarded to Indigenous groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A five&nbsp;year evaluation was undertaken between November
                    2014 and September 2015 to examine the program’s relevance,
                    effectiveness, efficiency and economy for the period of June
                    2010 to June 2015 during which the initial Terms and
                    Conditions (2010) of the PFP were applicable. The evaluation
                    found the program is aligned with the roles,
                    responsibilities and priorities of the federal government as
                    well as the mandate and priorities of the Board. There is a
                    continuing need for PFP to support the meaningful
                    participation of indigenous groups and other stakeholders in
                    the Board’s processes.

                    Participation of Indigenous Groups in the Regulatory Process
                    We are committed to reaching out to Indigenous people and
                    communities early in the hearing process, where there is a
                    potential impact on the rights and interests of these groups
                    from NEB-regulated projects. The Board’s Enhanced Aboriginal
                    Engagement (EAE) program provides proactive contact with
                    Indigenous groups that may be affected by a proposed
                    project, and to assist them in participating in the NEB’s
                    regulatory process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2015, under the EAE initiative, we contacted 210
                    Indigenous communities and organizations, and held 32
                    meetings with them, many in their own communities. These
                    meetings provide an opportunity for Indigenous
                    representatives to have their questions about NEB processes
                    answered. We also have Process Advisors who, as part of
                    their role, support Indigenous groups who are participating
                    in public hearings.

                    The Board is committed to hearing from Indigenous groups in
                    a way that respects their values and traditions. In an
                    effort to make public hearings more accessible, the NEB
                    adapts its processes to assist Indigenous intervenors so
                    they may effectively participate.

                    The Board continues to integrate ceremonies and traditional
                    practices into our hearing processes at the request of
                    Indigenous participants. Since Indigenous groups maintain an
                    oral tradition, this year during the TransMountain
                    Expansion, NGTL 2017 System Expansion, Enbridge Line 3 and
                    Energy East Project hearings we provided Elders and other
                    community members with the opportunity to give their
                    evidence orally at the hearing as well as in writing.

                    For all facility projects regulated by the Board, including
                    those that do not require a public hearing, the Board
                    continues to require companies to contact potentially
                    impacted Indigenous groups early in their project planning,
                    to explain the project, and consider and address any
                    concerns they may have in the project design.

                      During 2015, Aboriginal engagement practitioners,
                      socio-economic specialists and interested individuals
                      across the NEB initiated new ways of sharing information,
                      best practices and learnings around Aboriginal Engagement
                      and cultural awareness.

                    <em>Environmental Assessments</em>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The National Energy Board’s primary goal is that pipelines
                    and pipeline facilities are built and operated in a way that
                    is safe and protects the surrounding environment. The NEB
                    has decades of experience in considering potential
                    environmental effects when making its regulatory decisions.
                    We have been conducting environmental assessments under the
                    <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act</em> since it
                    first came into force in 1995, and considering environmental
                    impacts of projects under the NEB Act before and after that
                    date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the first steps the Board takes in considering a
                    project proposal is to do an environmental assessment (EA),
                    which is completed before the NEB makes a decision or
                    recommendation on whether or not to approve a project in the
                    public interest. EA is a tool in the project review process
                    that identifies, assesses and, to the extent possible,
                    mitigates the environmental effects of a project. Our EAs
                    examine:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>physical and meteorological environment</li>
                    <li>soil, soil productivity, and vegetation</li>
                    <li>wetlands, water quality, and quantity</li>
                    <li>fish, wildlife, and their habitat</li>
                    <li>
                      species at risk or species of special status and related
                      habitat
                    </li>
                    <li>heritage resources</li>
                    <li>
                      traditional land and resource use, and human health,
                      aesthetics, and noise
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The Board commonly imposes additional conditions on projects
                    to make environmental protection measures more robust
                    before, during and after construction – above and beyond the
                    measures required by regulations or proposed in project
                    applications.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>
                    Through conditions, the Board typically requires companies
                    to create and follow a detailed Environmental Protection
                    Plan (EPP) that describes all of the sensitive environmental
                    features identified during the EA, and outlines mitigation
                    measures and contingency plans for protecting the
                    environment through construction. The Board also typically
                    requires companies to carry out extended environmental
                    monitoring following construction, and provide reports on
                    this monitoring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In some cases, where there are particularly sensitive
                    environmental attributes identified in an EA, the Board may
                    impose conditions that provide a higher level of
                    environmental protection. An example of this is pipeline
                    projects being built through caribou critical habitat.
                    Companies are required to carry out habitat restoration, and
                    to implement offset measures to address residual effects to
                    caribou habitat. We also require companies to enhance
                    monitoring, over a longer period, to make sure that these
                    restoration and offset measures are effective. NEB
                    Environmental Specialists verify compliance with these
                    caribou-related conditions by assessing the Board required
                    restoration and offsets plans, and inspecting the
                    implementation of these plans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EA process also includes a strong emphasis on
                    watercourses where fish and fish habitat could be impacted
                    by a new or existing facility. The NEB ensures that fish and
                    fish habitat protection measures are implemented at all
                    watercourse crossings, as part of the NEB’s overall
                    environmental protection mandate. In December 2013, the NEB
                    signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the
                    Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to improve
                    the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory review
                    processes for energy facilities. In 2015, as part of the EA
                    process, the NEB continued to require state of the art
                    mitigation strategies for the protection of fish and fish
                    habitat by pipeline and power line projects under its
                    jurisdiction, and worked closely and collaboratively with
                    DFO so fish and fish habitat are protected throughout the
                    lifecycle of an NEB-regulated facility.

                    <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012</em> (CEAA
                    2012) requires that before federal authorities make any
                    decision that would allow a project to proceed, they must
                    determine whether a project is likely to cause significant
                    adverse environmental effects. Under section&nbsp;71 of
                    CEAA&nbsp;2012, the NEB is required, at the end of each
                    fiscal year, to report to both Houses of Parliament on its
                    activities under sections&nbsp;67, 68 and&nbsp;69 of

                    During the 2014–2015 fiscal year, the NEB completed
                    environmental assessments for two projects that are located
                    on or that cross federal lands. In each case, the NEB
                    determined that carrying out the project would not likely
                    cause any significant adverse environmental effects and
                    approved the project.

                    The Land Matters Group (LMG) is a multi-stakeholder advisory
                    group consisting of members of the public, regulatory,
                    industry and landowner groups who have a vested interest in
                    land matters and who are impacted by the activities of
                    companies that are subject to NEB regulation.

                    As one of its initiatives this year, the LMG initiated work
                    for a sub-committee to help shape information and additional
                    guidance for landowners related to easement agreements and
                    the Board’s oversight of land access and acquisition
                    processes. Members of the Steering Committee were invited to
                    participate in a panel session related to right-of-way
                    issues at the Board’s Safety Forum in June 2015, which was
                    heavily attended. The group continues to be involved in the
                    shaping and oversight of research related to the physical
                    issues of abandonment, and keenly interested in timely

                    Canadians depend on the pipeline transportation system for
                    safe, reliable and efficient energy supply, now and in the
                    future. The ability of this system to deliver natural gas,
                    natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, and petroleum
                    products is also critical to Canada’s economy. The NEB is
                    active and effective in Canada’s pursuit of a sustainable
                    energy future by integrating relevant economic,
                    environmental and social considerations when choosing a
                    course of action.

                    Our requirements encourage innovation where possible but

                    supports a sustainable energy system that will meet
                    Canadians’ needs today, while taking into consideration the

                    On 9&nbsp;July 2015, the Board granted Alliance Pipeline
                    Ltd. approval to implement new services and related tolls
                    and Tariff on the Alliance Pipeline, commencing
                    1&nbsp;December 2015. The approval included the proposed
                    toll methodology and firm tolls, new services and associated
                    terms and conditions, recoverable cost variances and
                    abandonment surcharge and a requirement for a reserve
                    account. Please see the NEB’s website to read the complete
                    decision (RH-002-2014).

                    On 8&nbsp;January 2015, the Board approved certain tariff
                    amendments for Trans Mountain in order to reduce
                    apportionment levels on the Trans Mountain Pipeline. These
                    amendments incorporated verification procedures and
                    verification limits in Trans Mountain’s nomination process.
                    The Board considered it important that the nomination
                    process be reflective of each shipper’s capability and
                    intent to supply petroleum to, and remove petroleum from,
                    the pipeline. Please see the NEB’s website to read the
                    complete decision (RHW-001-2013).

                    Under Part&nbsp;VI, applications to import and/or export
                    come in two forms: short-term orders and long-term licences.

                    In 2015, the Board received seven long-term licence
                    applications, down from the 20 applications received in
                    2014. There was a significant increase in the number of
                    Part&nbsp;VI long-term (import and export) licence
                    applications that were approved by the Board, from four
                    Board Decisions rendered in 2014 to 22 in 2015.

                  <p>
                    In 2015, the Board continued its northern engagement
                    activities through regular interaction with Indigenous and
                    government leadership and communities, as well as with
                    regulatory, environmental assessment, and wildlife and
                    renewable resource management agencies. Over 30 such
                    meetings have taken place, several including the NEB’s Chair
                    and CEO as an integral component of the Chair’s National
                    Engagement Initiative, and our on-going commitment to
                    listening to the voices of Northerners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engagement initiatives also involved the Board’s continuing
                    participation in a number of working groups, committees, and
                    conferences. These have included the NWT Board Forum, the
                    Arctic Forum, the Nunavut Oil and Gas Summit, the NWT
                    Geoscience Forum, the Arctic Council, the Beaufort Regional
                    Environmental Assessment, and emergency preparedness
                    exercises.

                  <p>
                    NEB representatives met with northern agencies regarding
                    regulatory changes, project updates and roles post-NWT
                    devolution. The January 2015 meeting included the Northern
                    Projects Management Office (NPMO), NRCan, MVIRB and AANDC.
                    The February 2015 Coordination on Northern initiatives
                    meeting included Environment Canada, GNWT, MVIRB, water
                    boards, and NPMO. The NEB Northern Regional Offices meet
                    regularly with the Northwest Territories Office of the
                    Regulator of Oil and Gas Operations (OROGO) to maximize
                    cooperation and information exchange in the exercise of NEB
                    and OROGO regulatory responsibilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The NEB continues to participate in the Arctic Regulators
                    Forum, where regulators share lessons learned and best
                    practices, and discuss regulatory issues. Our most recent
                    involvement was at the 26–27&nbsp;October 2015 conference in
                    Tromsø, Norway.

                    In 2015, the NEB worked on changes required to implement the
                    Energy Safety and Security Act (ESSA), which received Royal
                    Assent on 26&nbsp;February 2015. The NEB will be prepared
                    for open and transparent processes when ESSA comes into
                    force on 26&nbsp;February 2016. For example, the NEB will be
                    able to conduct a public hearing in relation to its duties
                    under COGOA, and to manage a participant funding program for
                    environmental assessments where CEAA 2012 applies.

                  <p>
                    The NEB received notification from Imperial Oil Resources
                    Ventures Limited (IORVL) on 26&nbsp;June 2015, stating that
                    it has deferred its proposed Beaufort Sea Joint Venture
                    Exploration Drilling Program. IORVL indicated that they will
                    ask the federal government to have their exploration
                    licenses retroactively extended to 16&nbsp;years. Imperial
                    stated that this extension would provide time to do the
                    necessary technical work and complete the regulatory
                    process. The NEB has suspended all work on IORVL potential
                    application and is awaiting notice from IORVL to initiate
                    any further action.

                  <p>
                    The NEB’s expectations of regulated companies are set out in
                    the acts and regulations relevant to the Boards mandate, as
                    well as through Board directions and orders. Companies must
                    fulfil any commitments they make in their submissions to the
                    Board, throughout all phases of regulatory oversight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On a continual basis, companies are required to anticipate,
                    manage, and mitigate any potential threats to safety and the
                    environment that may occur through the full lifecycle of
                    their facilities. The Board expects companies to achieve
                    this through a combination of performance-based management
                    practices, prescriptive standards and project-specific
                    conditions.

                  <p>
                    All aspects of a company’s operation are governed by legal
                    requirements, from design through to abandonment. The NEB
                    holds its regulated companies accountable against these
                    expectations using a rigorous compliance verification and
                    enforcement program, and through enforcement actions.

                  <p>
                    The Board uses CVAs to observe and gather information about
                    the state of compliance in a specific area of a company’s
                    operations, or to investigate whether companies are taking
                    the appropriate preventive or corrective actions. The
                    Board’s suite of CVAs includes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      inspections (of facilities under construction or in
                      operation)
                    </li>
                    <li>emergency exercise evaluations</li>
                    <li>emergency procedures manuals reviews</li>
                    <li>
                      formal compliance meetings (to check the progress of
                      programs or corrective actions)
                    </li>
                    <li>management system audits</li>

                  <p>
                    CVAs are designed to determine if legislation and
                    expectations are being followed, to assess if enforcement is
                    required, and to provide feedback to a company. During a
                    CVA, Inspection Officers observe the compliance status of
                    regulated companies. Where a noncompliance is noted,
                    follow-up is undertaken to verify corrective actions have
                    been put in place and to determine appropriate enforcement
                    actions.

                  <p>
                    As a key element of proactive incident prevention, the NEB
                    compiles information on the company’s performance for the
                    purposes of establishing trends, and for assessing the
                    amount of oversight required in the future. The results of
                    compliance verification activities are used along with other
                    inputs, such as incident data, to inform the NEB’s
                    compliance plan for the coming year.

                  <p>
                    Where non-compliances are observed through CVAs, the NEB
                    uses enforcement actions to achieve company compliance as
                    quickly and as effectively as possible. This reduces hazards
                    and protects the safety of workers, the public, the
                    environment and property. The NEB’s guiding enforcement

                        compliance, deter future non-compliance or to prevent
                        incidents/ accidents. When safety, security or
                        environmental protection issues are identified, the NEB
                        will use the most appropriate and efficient enforcement

                    Once a project is approved and construction is underway, the
                    NEB holds companies accountable for meeting all
                    environmental protection conditions. The NEB provides
                    general oversight of company environmental performance and
                    compliance with legislative requirements through various
                    compliance verification activities. This includes reviewing
                    the environmental reports that companies are required by
                    Board conditions to submit, conducting construction
                    inspections to ensure compliance with the company’s EPP and
                    any Board conditions, and conducting operations inspections
                    throughout the lifecycle of the project.

                    directed at ensuring that the environment is being
                    protected, including 41 environmental construction and
                    operations inspections, 30&nbsp;environmental report

                    <p>
                      Where non-compliances have been noted through CVAs,
                      enforcement actions are used to achieve compliance as
                      quickly and as effectively as possible. Achieving
                      compliance reduces hazards and protects the safety of
                      workers, the public, the environment and property. The
                      NEB&rsquo;s guiding enforcement policy states:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Among the Board’s top priorities is its obligation to
                      protect the safety of workers, the public, and the
                      environment. Fostering an environment of regulatory
                      compliance in the workplace is in the best business
                      interests of regulated companies and the Canadian public.
                      The NEB expects its regulated companies to establish and
                      communicate “a policy for the internal reporting of
                      hazards, potential hazards, incidents and near-misses that
                      includes the conditions under which a person who makes a
                      report will be granted immunity from disciplinary action.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In such cases where the internal reporting of a concern
                      does not result in a remedy of the situation, the Board
                      supports employees and others who want to make disclosures
                      to the NEB of alleged wrongdoings by regulated companies.
                      Since the establishment of a Whistleblower Contact Line in
                      2012, the NEB has received 21 disclosures, with
                      8&nbsp;disclosures occurring over the 2015-16 fiscal year.
                      It should be noted that a single disclosure can include
                      multiple allegations of non-compliance.The NEB follows up
                      on all allegations, using formal investigations,
                      inspections, additional audit activities, and/or company
                      meetings.

                  <p>
                    Incidents are a reporting requirement under the NEB’s
                    regulations. The Board’s regulated companies are accountable
                    for anticipating, preventing, mitigating and managing all
                    incidents. A company must immediately notify the NEB of any
                    reportable incident that relates to the construction,
                    operation or pending abandonment of its pipeline. The Board
                    considers any incident unacceptable, and follows up on all
                    reportable incidents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of January&nbsp;1, 2015 companies were required to follow
                    the <em>NEB Event Reporting Guidelines</em> and report all
                    incidents to the NEB’s online Event Reporting System (ERS).
                    The guidelines are intended to increase clarity on the
                    definition of incident
                  </p>

                    for the various regulations the NEB uses. The NEB expects
                    companies to use a precautionary approach to event and
                    incident reporting which can be summarized as “when in
                    doubt, report it”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the NEB is notified of an incident, its top priority is
                    safety and security of people, and protection of property
                    and the environment. In the event of a significant

                    Program, which can include mobilization of a field response

                    Our overall role as the lead regulatory agency is to monitor
                    company compliance as well as to assess the adequacy of the
                    company’s emergency response (if required) and their
                    subsequent investigation into the incident.

                    <p>
                      As part of the National Energy Board’s Engagement
                      Initiative, a Pipeline Safety Forum was held on
                      June&nbsp;2-3, 2015 to address how to better improve
                      pipeline safety. The NEB maintains a proactive approach to
                      pipeline safety, and recognizes that in order to prevent
                      incidents before they happen, we need to have discussions,
                      as well as share ideas and information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Pipeline Safety Forum focused on three main
                      objectives:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        An open exchange of information on technical pipeline
                        issues
                      </li>
                      <li>Increased understanding of stakeholder concerns</li>
                      <li>
                        Opportunities that both industry and regulators can take
                        to improve safety outcomes to better protect people,
                        property and the environment
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The Forum drew together speakers and participants from a
                      wide variety of backgrounds. In total, over 400 attendees
                      from industry, Canadian municipalities, first response
                      organizations, landowner associations, regulatory groups
                      and academia came together to listen to, consider and
                      discuss the common themes that emerged from the National
                      Engagement Initiative.

                    <p>
                      Chair Peter Watson welcomed all participants, noting
                      “...we are the people who can recommend improvements,
                      drive change, and instill safety culture in our
                      organizations. The ball is on our court and we need to
                      challenge ourselves to up our game and really think beyond
                      business as usual.” Keynote speaker Chris Seifert framed
                      it in working terms: “safety is not a goal, but an
                      expectation, held in common by everybody – from landowners
                      to mayors to CEOs to regulatory bodies. Safe operations
                      shouldn’t be rewarded or incentivized, because it should
                      not be an option”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The themes of sustained engagement as a pathway to trust,
                      and taking proactive action to improve safety culture
                      remained the focal point throughout much of the two-day
                      session. Participants pointed out, time and again, that
                      with knowledge exchange and collaboration across a variety
                      of groups will come better safety outcomes, because
                      stakeholders at all levels and perspectives would be
                      working from a common base of understanding and trust.

                    <em>Emergency Management</em>
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The NEB holds regulated companies responsible for
                    anticipating, preventing, managing and mitigating incidents
                    of any size and duration. Companies are accountable for
                    leading the response to incidents. The NEB’s role as lead
                    regulatory agency is to monitor, observe and assess the
                    overall effectiveness of the company’s emergency response.
                    Further, the NEB makes sure that the pipeline is safe to
                    restart and we verify that a regulated company conducts an
                    adequate and appropriate clean-up and remediation of any
                    environmental effects resulting from the incident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NEB staff activated its response procedures to the following
                    significant incidents in 2015. These incidents were:

                  <p>
                    The NEB expects that companies will incorporate lessons
                    learned from an incident into its Management System with the
                    goal of preventing future incidents.

                      Safety Culture
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      Through its Arctic Offshore Drilling Review in 2011, the
                      NEB identified organizational culture as a possible threat
                      to, or defense in, safety and environmental protection. An
                      NEB-commissioned study found that time and time again,
                      investigations into catastrophic accidents illustrate that
                      culture – and specifically safety culture – has the power
                      to trump the best intentions, strategy, and engineering.
                      For this reason, the Board has embarked on a path to
                      strengthen and improve industry awareness and
                      understanding of the role that safety culture plays in
                      contributing to, or building defenses against low
                      frequency-high consequence events like ruptures, releases,
                      and fatalities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In June 2014, the NEB released its Statement on Safety
                      Culture, in collaboration with the Canada-Nova Scotia
                      Offshore Petroleum Board and the Canada-Newfoundland and
                      Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board. The Statement included
                      a definition and framework intended to promote learning
                      and shared understanding of safety culture. The statement
                      also articulated the expectation that companies regulated
                      by the Board must build and maintain a positive safety
                      culture while remaining vigilant to potential cultural
                      threats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our ongoing work on safety culture has highlighted the
                      need for regulators and industry to look beyond
                      traditional safety measures (e.g. lost time worker injury
                      rates) as indicators of organizational safety; we must
                      collectively develop a more comprehensive view of hazard
                      identification and risk assessment relating to threats
                      associated with catastrophic accidents. The NEB is focused
                      on this effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is essential that we connect and work with industry and
                      industry associations on this, and we actively seek
                      opportunities to do so. The NEB remains committed to
                      continued outreach and engagement with stakeholders,
                      subject matter experts, and other interested parties in
                      order to develop meaningful guidance and tools, including
                      draft safety culture indicators, which will be released in
                      2016. Once finalized, these indicators will provide a
                      concrete description of safety culture at various stages
                      of development, which will be helpful measures for
                      industry and regulators alike.

                    <p>
                      On January&nbsp;1, 2015, the NEB rolled out its new online
                      Event Reporting System (ERS) for all of its regulated
                      companies to use when reporting regulatory events. The
                      system modernized how the NEB reviews incident and event
                      submissions and streamlined how the companies report
                      incidents. As a result, the NEB has more consistent and
                      available incident data to inform our actions.

                      During 2015, the NEB made important advancements in our

                      systematically track follow-up actions related to

                      In addition to our work on increasing the efficiency of
                      the inspection process and enhancing data collection, the
                      NEB took a major step towards improving the transparency
                      of inspections activities. Inspections reports and
                      compliance summaries related to the inspection activity
                      are now posted online in one report. This allows the
                      Canadian public to see at a glance what the NEB is looking
                      at, and what we are finding. The publication of these
                      activity reports allows the public to see the Board’s
                      expectations of the regulated companies regarding any

                  <p>
                    In 2015, there were 90 reportable incidents under the
                    <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations</em> (OPR) compared to 72
                    in 2014. <a href="#f1">Figure 1</a> shows the number of
                    events which occurred from 2008 through 2015 that resulted
                    in an incident. While the number of incidents reported in
                    2015 increased when compared with 2014, it remains below
                    both the 5&nbsp;year and 3&nbsp;year averages. There is
                    evidence that this increase is partly caused by better
                    understanding of incident reporting requirements as a result
                    of the <em>NEB Event Reporting Guidelines</em>.

                    types reported from 2008 to now. The NEB is pleased to note

                    two&nbsp;consecutive years.

                    2015. As noted above, this suggests that increased clarity
                    and understanding of reporting requirements resulted in an
                    increase in reporting from companies rather than an increase
                    in occurrence of these incidents, which is in the Board’s
                    view a positive outcome.

                  <p>
                    The remaining incident type that increased notably year over
                    year was “Fires”. The increase in fires was as a result of
                    equipment and electrical problems as well as welding or
                    cutting. Root cause data for fires in 2015 does not yield a
                    definitive common cause. In 2012/2013 NEB Compliance staff
                    initiated a focus on equipment inspections. There were fewer
                    fires reported the following year suggesting these efforts
                    made some impacts. While there were no indications of a
                    common or overlapping root cause for fires in 2015, the NEB
                    Compliance staff will continue the focus on equipment
                    inspections in 2016.

                  <p>
                    Preventing damage to pipelines is a shared responsibility.
                    Pipelines are buried, which means they can be at risk for
                    accidental damage from excavation or construction activity
                    nearby. This type of damage is preventable. As the federal
                    regulatory champion for the Canadian Common Ground Alliance,
                    the NEB is invested in raising public awareness by providing
                    information and encouraging cooperation, safety education,
                    and compliance with requirements.

                    Unauthorized activities (UAs) occur when the required
                    permission for an excavation or construction activity is not
                    obtained, or when safety instructions are not followed. UAs
                    are considered by the Board to be “near-miss incidents”, and
                    a predictor of future behaviour. We use the information
                    collected on UA reporting to plan Damage Prevention
                    compliance verification activities, as well as targeted
                    outreach and engagement to those who most need to hear it.

                    There were 224 reported UAs in 2015, compared to 144 for
                    2014. Although this appears to be a significant increase,
                    the Board considers this a positive statistic, because it
                    reflects more diligent company surveillance, and reliable
                    reporting of what is actually happening. An increase in the
                    number of reported UAs has been typical for most
                    NEB-regulated companies over the past two&nbsp;years, due to
                    enhanced awareness of NEB reporting requirements and
                    improvements in the NEB’s UA reporting system.

                    The distribution of reported UAs more evenly distributed
                    among the provinces than in prior years, where British
                    Columbia reported nearly half of all UAs in Canada.

                    This data shows the hotspots for UAs and informs our

                    Quebec, New Brunswick and BC stand out with UA rates that

                    Canadians make decisions about energy every day – from
                    consumer-level choices about products and consumption, to
                    business and government decisions about investment and
                    operations, to regulatory decisions that impact trade
                    systems and safety. The increasing pace of change in
                    Canadian and global energy markets and climate policy
                    development means that the need for up-to-date analysis on
                    energy supply and demand trends is greater than ever.

                  <p>
                    As Canada’s national energy regulator, a key aspect of the
                    NEB’s mandate is to study energy matters over which
                    Parliament has jurisdiction, and to provide the government
                    with advice on those issues. And, we are actively seeking
                    better, more user-friendly ways to produce and share energy
                    market information with the public. Work is underway to
                    expand the scope of our market reporting to include
                    discussion of greenhouse gas emissions, the link between
                    energy and environmental issues, and the role of new
                    bestavailable technologies in our energy landscape.

                  <p>
                    In the current energy market environment, prices, economic
                    growth, policies and regulation, action on climate change
                    and the development and use of new technologies, all play an
                    important role in shaping Canada’s energy future. It is our
                    goal to help Canadians and policy makers understand these
                    complex interactions through our analysis, reports, and
                    statistics.

                    The Board monitors the integrated North American energy

                    Canada’s Energy Story – 2015

                  <p>
                    In 2015, Canada’s crude oil production and exports
                    increased, driven mostly by oil sands production growth.
                    Global benchmark crude oil prices rebounded to the US$60s by
                    mid-year, but subsequently declined to the mid US$30s by
                    year-end. Global oil storage inventories remained
                    persistently high, due in part to limited decline in United
                    States (US) tight oil production, and weaker than expected
                    demand from Europe and Asia. Similar to 2014, OPEC
                    (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) agreed
                    at its December 2015 meeting to not cut crude oil production
                    to support prices. Alongside these global price movements,
                    oil pipeline capacity additions in the US and Canada
                    facilitated increased crude oil exports for Canadian
                    producers. Meanwhile, Eastern Canadian refineries imported
                    record levels of US light crude oil, displacing traditional
                    sources from abroad.

                    In 2015, North American natural gas prices decreased due to
                    steady production in Canada and growing production in the
                    US. Demand for natural gas grew more modestly, creating
                    plentiful supply. At the end of the storage injection season
                    in mid-November, North American inventories reached an
                    unprecedented level of 4.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). In
                    addition, there was a trend of increasing imports of gas
                    from the US into eastern Canadian markets. Finally, there
                    was also a shift in global liquefied natural gas (LNG)
                    market dynamics in 2015: widely available global supply,
                    weaker than anticipated Asian demand, decreased prices, and
                    escalating project costs.

                    In the electricity market, Canada’s supply mix continued to
                    evolve. Renewable generation continued to grow, with wind
                    capacity reaching 11,205 megawatts (MW) in 2015. This was
                    also the case for gas-fired generation, which continued
                    displacing coal generation due to lower gas prices and
                    federal coal-fired generation regulations. In addition,
                    multiple large hydro projects are under construction in
                    British Columbia (BC), northern Manitoba, northeastern
                    Quebec and Labrador and a significant expansion at the Mica
                    dam in the interior of BC was completed in 2015.

                    Canada remains a net crude oil exporter and the largest
                    supplier of crude oil to the United States. Total Canadian
                    crude oil exports averaged approximately
                    3.0&nbsp;million&nbsp;barrels per day (MMb/d) this year,
                    which is a 6.2&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase from 2014. Almost
                    all Canadian crude oil exports, approximately
                    99&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, went to the US. Of the total export
                    volume in 2015, approximately 71.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent was
                    heavy oil, up from 68.6&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent in 2014. In 2015,
                    the total value of crude oil exports was approximately
                    C$51.9&nbsp;billion based on an average export price of
                    C$46.82 per barrel.

                    imports of 1.5&nbsp;million&nbsp; m&sup3;/day. Therefore,
                    net exports averaged approximately
                    150&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3;/day, which is similar to 2014.
                    In 2015, the value of Canadian net exports of natural gas
                    was approximately C$6.9&nbsp;billion.

                      To improve Canadian energy data and publicly available
                      information, the NEB has built strategic alliances with
                      provincial, national and international energy regulators
                      and government agencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are several initiatives underway, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The Trilateral Initiative on Energy Information: The NEB
                        is participating in the trilateral initiative on energy
                        information with the US and Mexico. This Trilateral aims
                        to create a framework for consultation and sharing of
                        publicly available information among the participants,
                        setting the stage for dialogue, comparisons and
                        deliverables on information and energy outlooks for the
                        North American region.

                      <li>
                        NEB- EIA Cooperation: The NEB has also established a
                        framework for continuous and regular dialogue with the
                        US Energy Information Administration (EIA). This is a
                        significant milestone, as the EIA is a world leader in
                        collection, dissemination and provision of energy
                        information. A draft MOU between the two organizations
                        has been developed and is in the process of being
                        finalized.

                    <p>
                      Through these initiatives, the NEB is learning and
                      adopting best practices for energy information sharing.

                    Regulatory excellence is by nature a continually evolving
                    state that is nimble and responsive. The NEB has been
                    working with the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) and others
                    in the national and international field, to define
                    excellence, understand how a regulator can foster excellence
                    within its organization, and to continually monitor this
                    state.

                    developed by Cary Coglianese from the University of
                    Pennsylvania, our next step is to build an NEB-specific
                    Framework that responds to a national energy regulator’s
                    realities, challenges, and opportunities for excellence.

                  <p>
                    The NEB continues to work with other regulators around the
                    world to examine the concept of regulatory excellence and
                    learn from each other’s experiences. This includes work

                <em>NEB is a Top&nbsp;100 Employer in Canada!</em>
              </h3>
              <p>
                In November, the NEB was again named as one of Canada’s
                Top&nbsp;100 Employers for 2016 for the seventh&nbsp;year in a
                row (the NEB is a seven-time winner as we were also named in
                2009). In addition to that honour, we were also named as one of
                Alberta’s Top Employers for 2016 and as one of Canada’s
                Top&nbsp;100 Family Friendly Employers, the latter being a
                designation that recognizes employers offering progressive and
                forward-thinking programs for employees with young children,
                other dependents, and/or family responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Board is pleased to receive these honours as they showcase
                not only the types of programs offered to employees, but they
                also focus on the employees themselves. The NEB is not just a
                Top&nbsp;100 Employer and Family Friendly Employer; it is a
                “Top&nbsp;100 Team” that strives for excellence in all that it
                does.

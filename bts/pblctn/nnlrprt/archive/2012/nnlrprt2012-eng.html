            />Keeping the public safe, protecting the environment, promoting
            economic efficiency and having meaningful conversations with
            Canadians: all great reasons to come to work every day. As Canada’s
            national energy regulator, these have always been priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take every opportunity to verify that the pipelines we regulate
            are operating safely. We require all pipeline companies to
            anticipate, prevent, manage and mitigate potentially dangerous
            conditions associated with their pipelines. All incidents are
            preventable and we expect the companies we regulate to strive for
            zero. Equally important is the commitment to maintain an open
            channel of dialogue with you as Canadians. We will continue to
            listen to your priorities so that we may evolve in a way that
            matches your expectations.

            included some of the most significant changes to the NEB Act since
            its implementation in&nbsp;1959. Since July, the Board has been
            working hard to implement these legislated changes. This work will
            support the NEB’s pursuit of continual improvement in serving
            Canadians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the new legislation, we must now set time limits for
            regulatory reviews and make sure that these time limits are met.
            This provides the public with enhanced certainty around regulatory
            proceedings and NEB project reviews. The Board has also been
            equipped with new compliance enforcement tools in the form of
            administrative monetary penalties (AMPs). AMPs will enable us to
            impose financial penalties on companies or individuals for
            non-compliances related to safety and the environment. Further, the
            Board received additional funds to continually improve pipeline
            safety. With these funds, the NEB is increasing inspection
            activities by fifty&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent and are doubling
            comprehensive audits. You will see more information on these and
            other regulatory changes throughout this report as well as how these
            tools better equip the NEB to protect Canadians and the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB administers oil and gas exploration and production
            activities in Canada’s North. In the
            <a href="/nrth/rctcffshrdrllngrvw/2011fnlrprt/index-eng.html"
              >Arctic Review Report</a
            >
            released in&nbsp;2011, we made a commitment to the people of the
            North to continue the meaningful dialogue we had with them during
            the Arctic Review. We are delivering on this commitment. We have
            expanded Arctic activities this past year through engagement with
            northern communities, youth, governments, other regulatory bodies,
            and land claim institutions. As part of this commitment, we signed
            Memoranda of Understanding with two&nbsp;Nunavut Boards and
            two&nbsp;Inuvialuit Boards that will promote regulatory
            collaboration in the North.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am particularly proud of our visits to high schools and colleges
            in the North. As future leaders, young people have a unique
            perspective that we believe needs to be listened to, now. We have
            encouraged them to speak up, and to express their concerns and
            points of view on the energy matters we deal with in the North.

            This year the NEB was again recognized as one of Canada’s Top 100
            Employers (for the third year in a row and the fourth time). I am
            incredibly proud of this recognition, but for me it is not just
            about us as an employer – we are a “Top 100 Team”. This organization
            is fortunate enough to be made up of truly remarkable staff and
            Board Members doing amazing work. We were also named as a top Family
            Friendly Employer in Canada. Supporting families is key to the
            success of any organization and we are honored to have received this
            designation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking forward to&nbsp;2013, I am confident the National Energy
            Board will continue to be a strong regulator of Canada’s energy
            sector. That is our job. The companies we regulate must perceive
            compliance monitoring and enforcement to be unrelenting and ever
            present. A regulator must never be satisfied that it has done all it
            can to protect people and the environment. All the Board Members and
            approximately 400&nbsp;staff at the NEB take this responsibility
            very seriously. We remain committed to regulating in the public
            interest and listening to the evolving priorities of Canadians whom
            we serve.

            <a href="/bts/whwr/index-eng.html">independent federal regulator</a>
            established in&nbsp;1959. Our mandate is to promote safety and
            security, environmental protection and economic efficiency in the
            Canadian public interest, in the regulation of pipelines, energy
            development and trade. The Board reports to Parliament through the
            Minister of Natural Resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is funded by Parliament through the

              rel="external"

            by the Federal government from the companies whose energy facilities
            are regulated by the Board. Financial statements for cost recovery
            purposes are prepared annually and audited by the Office of the
            Auditor General. The audited financial statements for cost recovery
            purposes can be found on our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the Cost Recovery Financial Statements, which are
            prepared on a calendar year basis, the NEB prepares financial
            statements that form part of the Public Accounts of Canada.
            Additional information on the NEB’s budgets and plans may be found
            on our website. Table&nbsp;1 provides an overview of NEB financial

            <em>Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act</em> - Changes to NEB
            Legislation

          <p>
            In the summer of&nbsp;2012, the Government of Canada made
            significant legislative changes to the NEB Act. This was one of the
            most significant amendments to the NEB Act since it was introduced
            in&nbsp;1959.
          </p>
          <p>
            The
            <em

              ></em
            >
            received Royal Assent on 29&nbsp;June&nbsp;2012, with portions of
            the Act coming into force on 6&nbsp;July&nbsp;2012. The Act includes
            legislative changes to a number of Acts, including the NEB Act and
            CEAA&nbsp;2012. The intent of this legislation is to support job
            creation and economic growth while maintaining strong environmental
            protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key changes to the NEB Act that came into effect in July&nbsp;2012
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A fixed beginning-to-end time limit of 18&nbsp;months for most NEB
              project hearings. From receipt of a complete application, the NEB
              will have 15&nbsp;months to complete the project assessment. For
              applications requiring a certificate, from this point the Governor
              in Council (GiC) will have three&nbsp;months to make a decision;
            </li>
            <li>
              The GiC will make the decision to approve or deny all major
              pipeline projects. The NEB’s report on a project will include
              conditions to be attached to any certificate issued. The Board
              makes the final decision as to what its recommendation will be,
              and what terms and conditions would apply;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Chair of the NEB will set time limits for specific project
              reviews within the maximum 15&nbsp;month time limit. The Act
              provides the Chair with a variety of tools to make sure time
              limits are met and applications are dealt with in a timely manner;
            </li>
            <li>
              For projects designated under CEAA&nbsp;2012 the NEB will conduct
              an environmental assessment pursuant to that Act. For projects not
              designated under CEAA&nbsp;2012, the NEB will continue to conduct
              an environmental assessment as a part of its public interest
              mandate under the NEB Act;
            </li>
            <li>
              Factors that the Board may consider when reviewing export licences
              for natural gas and oil have been changed. The requirement to hold
              a hearing for gas export licences has also been removed;
            </li>
            <li>
              Section&nbsp;112 of the NEB Act now includes the option of
              pursuing criminal prosecution for unauthorized activity on
              NEB-regulated pipeline rights of way;
            </li>
            <li>
              For major projects, the NEB must hear concerns from those persons
              or groups who are directly affected by the project. The Board may
              also hear from those who have relevant information or expertise
              about the project; and,
            </li>
            <li>
              The NEB Act previously restricted the number of temporary Board
              Members to six. The amended NEB Act does not have this
              restriction. This increased flexibility means that more temporary
              Members may be appointed, allowing the Board to be more effective
              and responsive to workload pressures and time limits for reviews.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Changes to the NEB Act expected to come into effect in
            July&nbsp;2013 include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Authorization for the Board to establish a system of
              administrative monetary penalties (AMPs); and,
            </li>
            <li>
              Requirement for the Board to consider the effects of pipeline and
              power line crossings of navigable waters; such works will not
              require separate authorizations under the
              <em>Navigable Waters Protection Act</em>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some of the key areas identified above will be highlighted with more
            detail throughout this report.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB will continue to conduct proceedings in an open, fair and
            impartial manner. The Board will also continue to conduct an
            independent, fair and accessible environmental assessment and
            regulatory review process for all pipeline projects. For major
            pipeline projects we will recommend whether or not the GiC should
            approve or deny a project, as well as terms and conditions in the
            public interest.

            Compulsory incident reporting under the OPR-99 alerts the NEB of
            environmental and safety incidents and is used to provide compliance
            oversight. This information is also supplemented by the voluntary
            reporting initiative for safety and environmental performance
            indicators captured in the report issued by the NEB in
            December&nbsp;2011,
            <em

              Pipeline Performance, 2000-2009</em

            Injury frequencies, incident trends and other indicators provide

            The National Energy Board holds regulated companies accountable for
            anticipating, preventing, mitigating and managing incidents of any
            size or duration. We expect regulated companies to develop a strong
            safety culture as part of their management system. Any release of
            product is considered unacceptable by the Board. When we are
            notified of a release of product, our top priorities are the safety
            and security of people, and the protection the environment.

          <h3 class="mrgn-tp-0">Damage Prevention</h3>
          <p>
            Preventing damage to pipelines is a shared responsibility. Pipeline
            companies are required to ensure that people know how to safely
            conduct activities, such as excavation and construction near
            pipelines, and people planning activities near pipelines are
            required to “Call Before You Dig.” The NEB provides regulatory
            oversight of activities such as the examples provided above, and
            must create the conditions necessary to hold people accountable for
            carrying out these responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NEB’s regulatory framework for damage prevention is made up of a
            number of regulatory tools designed to make sure that companies and
            individuals are effective in managing safety and environmental
            protection in their day-to-day interactions with pipelines. The
            NEB’s compliance monitoring and enforcement activities support this
            framework and are used to promote compliance. The Board’s Plan for
            Improving Regulatory Clarity for this framework, released in
            February&nbsp;2012, focuses on making sure that those planning work
            near pipelines have the information they need to make safe choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Federal Regulatory Champion for the Canadian Common Ground
            Alliance (an organization dedicated to pipeline damage prevention
            solutions), the NEB will continue to collaborate with all those
            involved in promoting safe work practices around pipelines. In
            addition to regulatory initiatives to clarify the roles and
            responsibilities of everyone involved, in&nbsp;2013 the NEB will
            commence work on a national standard for damage prevention. Through
            use of a consensus-based Canadian Standards Association (CSA)
            committee, the Board will work jointly with representatives of the
            oil and gas and construction industries, landowners, locators,
            one-call centres, and other governments to provide technical support
            in the development of CSA-Z247. This national standard will provide
            minimum requirements, guidance, and best practices for the
            development of damage prevention programs for the petroleum and
            natural gas industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            To provide clarity around enforcement, in&nbsp;2012, the NEB
            developed a clear model explaining how companies must report
            unauthorized activities near pipelines, and how the Board will
            respond to these reports through the Compliance and Enforcement
            Initiative. The purpose of the model is to provide transparency and
            consistency in the application of enforcement tools available to the
            NEB. Since releasing the model, the NEB has been using the lessons
            learned from the standardized reports it has received to measure how
            its regulatory framework is working and to identify areas for
            improvement. The model also helps to identify patterns of
            non-compliance so that compliance verification activities for
            following years can be planned and prioritized.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2012 there were 127 reported unauthorized activities related
            to NEB regulated facilities, up from&nbsp;73 in&nbsp;2011.

          <p>
            The number of reported unauthorized activities fluctuates from year
            to year due to a number of factors. The number may grow as
            development and construction activity increases around pipelines.
            Also, increased compliance activities by the NEB has resulted in
            companies becoming more aware of our reporting requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board strives for continual improvement in this area. Everyone
            involved must work to reduce unauthorized activities, with the
            ultimate goal of seeing none at all.

              >Action Plan on Safety and Environmental Protection</a
            >, the Board will be hosting a forum on pipeline and facility safety
            on the 5th and 6<sup>th</sup> of June&nbsp;2013 in Calgary, Alberta.
            As part of the Safety Forum, the NEB is committed to engaging
            interested regulators and industry participants in a dialogue to
            further the sharing of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Safety Forum presents an opportunity for the NEB, other
            regulators and oil and gas companies to explore emerging issues in
            the oil and gas industry for safety management. Key issues are
            corporate leadership’s role in building and maintaining a safety
            culture, integration within management systems and effective safety
            performance measurement.

          <p>
            In September of&nbsp;2012, the NEB engaged with a group of
            international regulators at the International Pipeline Conference
            and again in October with Canadian safety regulators to further
            discuss emerging safety and environmental protection issues.

            />Safety culture happens when everybody believes in it, talks about
            it, promotes it and lives it. The Board is convinced that proactive
            safety management and a culture of safety will reduce incidents that
            result in fatalities and injuries, the impact of incidents on the
            environment and property damage resulting from incidents. The
            pipeline industry’s safety performance is receiving intense scrutiny
            and continual improvement of even good safety records is necessary.
            We require that companies we regulate have an approach to operating
            that is systematic, comprehensive and proactive in building and
            managing a culture that emphasizes safety, minimizes risk, and
            satisfies regulatory requirements. The Board’s OPR-99 requires
            companies to develop and implement management and protection
            programs. The NEB conducts audits, inspections, and other
            assessments of regulated companies to test the adequacy and
            effectiveness of their management and environmental protection
            programs.

            Amendment to the
            <em>Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999</em> (OPR-99)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Board’s current pipeline regulations, the OPR-99, brought into
            force in&nbsp;1999 and updated over the years along with Canadian
            Standards Association revisions, are effective at defining a
            baseline management system. While innovative for their time, the NEB
            believes more can be done to provide clarity and additional details
            around what is expected. This is why we are introducing amendments
            to our regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2011, we released a Proposed Regulatory Change (PRC)
            <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/Filing/A30543"
              >[Filing&nbsp;A30543]</a

            that provided clarification on the Board’s expectation that a
            pipeline company’s approach to operating is systematic,
            comprehensive and proactive in managing risks in order to promote
            safety, security and environmental protection. On
            27&nbsp;October&nbsp;2012, the regulatory amendment with management
            system provisions was pre-published in <em>Canada Gazette</em>,
            Part&nbsp;I for a 30-day&nbsp;comment period. The Board will review
            and consider the comments received and the amendments will continue
            to follow the federal regulatory development process. The regulatory
            amendment includes several elements designed to advance safety
            culture, including a requirement for the designation of a company
            officer who is personally accountable for the management system and
            the achievement of outcomes related to safety and environmental
            protection. We believe compliance with these provisions will provide
            the foundation for a more rigorous, industry-wide culture of safety.

          <h3 class="mrgn-tp-0">Emergency Management</h3>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2011, the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) conducted an
            audit of the Board’s Emergency Management Program. The OAG observed
            that overall the Board has designed a sound risk-informed approach
            to monitor regulated companies’ adherence to regulations and Board
            expectations. In its report, the OAG recommended that the NEB
            establish and implement a clear action plan that sets out specific
            steps to improve the Board’s risk-informed model; practices and
            procedures for monitoring compliance; documenting compliance; and
            procedures for follow-up on non-compliances. Following the audit and
            subsequent recommendations, the NEB established a corrective action
            plan (CAP) to address the audit findings, and committed to
            completing the CAP by April&nbsp;2012. We completed all action items
            outlined in the CAP before the end of April&nbsp;2012.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first part of&nbsp;2012 the Board focused efforts on:
            developing a process to review baseline critical information in a
            company’s Emergency Procedures Manual (EPM); strengthening the
            Board’s compliance verification processes; training staff in the
            updated processes; and reviewing the compliance risk model. The NEB
            also followed-up on deficiencies in company EPMs and enhanced
            risk-informed planning by creating a process to evaluate the
            effectiveness of the risk model. The Board is committed to continual
            improvement in its emergency management program.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to completing the CAP in&nbsp;2012, we have also
            completed Critical Information Checks on all company’s EPMs to
            assess whether they have included baseline information. NEB staff
            also evaluated 13&nbsp;simulated emergency response exercises and
            provided feedback on how to improve companies’ plans and responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the Emergency Management Program, the NEB focuses on
            overseeing the compliance and continual improvement of regulated
            companies’ emergency preparedness and response programs. Since
            April&nbsp;2012, the NEB has been working with the Canadian
            Standards Association (CSA) and emergency management experts to
            draft an emergency preparedness and response standard for the
            petroleum and natural gas industry. The standard is expected to be
            published in&nbsp;2014. This will be the first standard specific to
            emergency response for the petroleum and natural gas pipeline
            industry. NEB staff also continue to participate on the
            CSA&nbsp;Z1600 (Emergency and Continuity Program Standard) Technical

            Safety has been a critical part of the Board’s mandate since its

            the Government of Canada provided the NEB with an additional
            $13.5&nbsp;million to hire additional staff over the next
            two&nbsp;years to strengthen the Board’s oversight of pipeline
            safety. The funding will allow the Board to increase the number of
            annual inspections for NEB-regulated companies from 100 to 150, and
            to double the number of management system audits from three to six
            per&nbsp;year.

              will authorize the Board to create a

                >system of AMPs</a
              >
              through regulations. AMPs are financial penalties the Board may
              impose on companies or individuals for non-compliance with the NEB
              Act, regulations, decisions, permits, orders, licences or
              certificate conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Board’s proposed approach is to establish two&nbsp;categories
              of violations, with two&nbsp;baseline penalties for each category
              based on whether the violation is committed by an individual or
              company. The new AMP sections in the NEB Act set out the maximum
              daily penalties: for individuals the maximum daily penalty is
              $25,000 for each violation, and for companies the maximum daily
              penalty is $100,000 per violation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Act stipulates that each day that a violation continues is
              considered to be a separate violation. This means that separate
              penalties could be issued per infraction, per day with no maximum
              total financial penalty.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the summer of&nbsp;2012, the NEB released a discussion paper to
              provide an overview of key elements of a proposed AMPs system
              under the NEB Act, and to seek comments from interested persons.
              During the public comment period Board staff met with several
              groups to discuss the AMPs proposal, answer questions and solicit
              feedback. A webinar was also held on 6&nbsp;September&nbsp;2012
              with numerous organizations and individuals from across the
              country.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of these consultations were incorporated into a set of
              draft regulations that the Board pre-published in
              February&nbsp;2013 in the <em>Canada Gazette</em>, Part&nbsp;I.

            In the past year the Board has continued to expand northern
            engagement activities through meetings with Northern communities,
            youth, governments, regulatory agencies, and land claim
            institutions. The Board remains committed to listening to those who
            would be most affected by drilling activities in Canada’s Arctic in
            support of realizing shared objectives for safety and environmental
            protection.

            information exchange, and regulatory coordination between the NEB
            and the Northern Boards.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the NEB partnered with Aboriginal Affairs and Northern
            Development Canada, and the Government of the Northwest Territories
            to organize over 20&nbsp;focused outreach and engagement sessions
            with communities, land claim organizations, and government agencies
            to explain the NEB’s role in regulating oil and gas activities in
            the North, including proposed hydraulic fracturing operations in the

            and provided written recommendations to the Board. In its response
            the Board noted that many of the sub-committee’s recommendations
            were complementary to and supportive of Board initiatives in

            reliable and efficient energy supply, now and in the future. The
            ability of this system to deliver natural gas, natural gas liquids
            (NGLs), crude oil, and petroleum products is also critical to
            Canada’s economy. The NEB is active and effective in Canada’s
            pursuit of a sustainable energy future by integrating relevant
            economic, environmental and social considerations when choosing a
            course of action.

            The NEB’s regulatory framework is designed to promote safety,
            security, environmental protection and efficient energy
            infrastructure and markets. Mandatory requirements encourage
            innovation where possible but also focus on specific design,
            operational practices or management methods when necessary. The
            regulatory framework supports a sustainable energy system that will
            meet Canadians’ needs today, while taking into consideration the
            needs of Canadians tomorrow.

          <h3 class="mrgn-tp-0">Full Cycle Regulation</h3>
          <p>
            The NEB regulates and considers issues of design, construction,
            operation and abandonment of energy infrastructure facilities. In
            other words, the Board regulates from “start to finish”, and holds
            pipeline companies responsible for the full cycle cost of the
            pipelines they operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In May&nbsp;2009, the NEB released a decision directing all
            NEB-regulated companies to begin setting aside abandonment funds and
            set out a five-year Action Plan in that regard. The five-year Action
            Plan contains steps which will facilitate the setting-aside and
            reporting on funds by&nbsp;2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            The five-year Action Plan is on track. In November&nbsp;2011, all
            large regulated pipeline companies and many smaller ones filed their
            initial estimates of costs to abandon their pipelines. The Board
            held a public hearing in October and November of&nbsp;2012 to
            examine the assumptions and cost estimates of the large pipeline
            companies. The Board will announce its Decision on these matters in
            February&nbsp;2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first half of&nbsp;2013, pipeline companies must file further
            applications regarding the timeframe in which abandonment related
            funds will be collected and how the funds will be set-aside and
            managed. Following Board decisions in&nbsp;2014 on collection
            periods, set-aside mechanisms, and investment policies, companies
            will be required to report on funds collected starting in&nbsp;2015.

            For a large facilities application, the Board’s work begins when a
            company files a Project Description for the project. The NEB uses a
            Project Description to initiate pre-application activities. These
            include early public and Aboriginal engagement processes; initiating
            the NEB’s Participant Funding Program for the project; and where
            possible, seeking feedback on the timing of an oral public hearing.
            The NEB works with the federal
            <a href="/bts/ctrg/gnnb/mjrprjctffc-eng.html"
              >Major Projects Management Office</a
            >
            (MPMO) to ensure the timely and effective regulatory review of large
            NEB regulated projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            We engage the public and Aboriginal groups who may be impacted by a
            project through the Board’s engagement staff (process advisors), who
            provide support to hearing participants, engage stakeholders, and
            share information about Appropriate Dispute Resolution, hearing
            processes, participant funding and methods of presenting information
            to the Board.

            Applicants must submit applications or information that enable the
            Board to undertake a technical assessment of the various impacts of
            a project, and make an informed decision in the Canadian public
            interest that considers, among other things, present and future
            economic, environmental and social considerations. A written or oral
            hearing is usually held to consider applications for major projects.
            This allows the company proposing the project, and people or groups
            who are impacted, a chance to provide information and input
            regarding the project. Applicants can request a

          <p>
            When the Board issues a certificate following the GiC approval of a
            large facility application, the approval is contingent on meeting
            conditions, which are requirements that must be met before a
            facility is allowed to be constructed and operated. Conditions
            pertain to areas such as engineering, engagement, safety and
            environmental protection. The Board holds the company accountable to
            conditions outlined in the certificate. If the project is built, the
            NEB will monitor the project throughout its lifespan, and require
            the certificate holder to meet these conditions, as well as other
            applicable regulatory requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;2012 the Board considered many applications for new pipeline
            facilities, tolls and tariff filings, activities on frontier lands,
            as well as import and export licences and orders. For a complete
            list of the proceedings before the Board in&nbsp;2012, please see

          </h3>
          <h4><em>Abandonment of Empire Odourant Stati</em>on</h4>
          <p>
            On 5&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012 the NEB approved an application by
            St.&nbsp;Clair Pipelines Management Inc. to abandon the Empire
            Odourant Station located in the Regional Municipality of Niagara,
            Ontario. St.&nbsp;Clair had provided odourization services to Empire
            State Pipeline (Empire) at the Station site since&nbsp;1993. Empire,
            the sole customer was served by the Station under an agreement that
            ended in&nbsp;2010 after which the station was no longer required.
            St.&nbsp;Clair proposed an abandonment plan for the station
            involving dismantling, removing and disposing of all infrastructure
            at the station site. St.&nbsp;Clair submitted that it identified and
            consulted with all stakeholders and that there were no outstanding
            concerns. No stakeholders applied to be intervenors in this written
            hearing. The Board granted leave to abandon the station, subject to
            environmental and financial conditions. It was noted that
            TransCanada PipeLines may pursue an agreement with St.&nbsp;Clair to
            acquire the station site for another purpose and, if this is the
            case, a further application to the Board will be required. The Board
            retains jurisdiction over St.&nbsp;Clair’s activities at the site
            until all conditions of the Order are met to the satisfaction of the
            Board.

          <h4><em>Vantage Pipeline Project</em></h4>
          <p>
            On 19&nbsp;January&nbsp;2012 the NEB approved an application for the
            Vantage Pipeline Project (the project) submitted by Vantage Pipeline
            Canada ULC (Vantage). The project will carry liquid ethane from Hess
            Corporation’s natural gas processing plant near Tioga, North Dakota,
            USA through Saskatchewan to interconnect with the Alberta Ethane
            Gathering System (AEGS) near Empress, Alberta. The liquid ethane
            transported by the pipeline will be used by Alberta’s petrochemical
            industry. The Board was satisfied given the evidence provided by
            Vantage that Alberta’s domestic ethane supply is declining and will
            probably continue to decline for some time. Vantage demonstrated
            that there will be sufficient future ethane supplies and processing
            capacity for the project to be viable over its economic life. The
            Canadian portion of the project would involve the construction and
            operation of approximately 578.3&nbsp;km of new 273&nbsp;mm
            (NPS&nbsp;10) outside diameter high vapour pressure steel pipeline,
            from the Canada-U.S. border near Beaubier, Saskatchewan to the AEGS
            near Empress. The pipeline route is approximately 573.8&nbsp;km in
            Saskatchewan and 4.5&nbsp;km in Alberta. Vantage has routed the
            pipeline to be within or alongside existing pipelines and road
            right-of-way for approximately&nbsp;503.7&nbsp;km.

          <h4><em>BC LNG Export Licence</em></h4>
          <p>
            On 2&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012 the Board approved an application by BC
            LNG Export Cooperative LLC (BC LNG) for a licence to export
            liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a proposed liquefaction terminal to
            be located on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia. BC
            LNG applied for a licence term of 20&nbsp;years and a maximum annual
            volume of 1.8&nbsp;million tonnes of LNG, which is approximately
            equivalent to 2.4&nbsp;billion&nbsp;m&sup3; or 84.5&nbsp;billion
            cubic feet (Bcf), for a total of 36&nbsp;million tonnes over a
            20-year&nbsp;period. While originally scheduled for an oral hearing,
            which was postponed at the request of an intervenor (that
            subsequently withdrew), the proceeding became a written hearing with
            three intervenors supporting the application. This application,
            which followed the approval of the KM&nbsp;LNG Export License
            in&nbsp;2011, was the second to be considered by the Board since the
            de-regulation of the natural gas market in&nbsp;1985. In approving
            the application, the Board satisfied itself that the quantity of gas
            to be exported does not exceed the surplus remaining after allowance
            for reasonably foreseeable Canadian demand.

          <h4>
            <em>Landowner Complaint Against TransCanada PipeLines Limited</em>
          </h4>
          <p>
            On 3&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012, a Member designated under
            section&nbsp;14 of the NEB Act issued a decision on a complaint by
            the landowner of Juras Farms that TransCanada PipeLines Limited
            (TCPL) had failed to adequately reclaim land crossed by its pipeline
            near Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. The land was crossed by TCPL’s
            Niagara Line in&nbsp;1990, and was subject to a
            two-year&nbsp;restoration program ending in&nbsp;1992. Further
            reclamation activities were performed by TCPL in&nbsp;2004 in
            response to the concerns of the previous owner of the land. TCPL
            carried out a number of monitoring and assessment studies
            since&nbsp;2004. In May of&nbsp;2010, the landowner informed the
            Board that he was the new owner of the land and asked the NEB to
            meet with TCPL and himself to resolve outstanding reclamation
            issues. Following a site visit and a further crop specialist study,
            the landowner filed a formal complaint in January of&nbsp;2011. A
            soil investigation report ordered by the Board showing elevated
            levels of several compounds and significant soil pH differences was
            reviewed by all parties. The NEB directed TCPL to develop and
            implement a soil reclamation plan to be prepared by a mutually
            agreed upon independent third party consultant in consultation with
            the landowner for the complete removal and replacement of the soil
            in the affected area. The reclamation plan was approved, and its
            implementation will be monitored by Board staff.
          </p>
          <h4><em>Southern Lights Pipeline Tolls</em></h4>
          <p>
            On 9&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012 the NEB approved NEB
            Tariff&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1 (Tariff&nbsp;1) and NEB
            Tariff&nbsp;No.&nbsp;2 (Tariff&nbsp;2) for service on the Southern
            Lights Pipeline filed by Enbridge Southern Lights GP Inc. (ESL), and
            accordingly denied the relief requested by Imperial Oil Limited
            (Imperial). On 31&nbsp;May&nbsp;2010, ESL submitted Tariff&nbsp;1
            (governing rules and regulations) and Tariff&nbsp;2 (governing
            tolls) to the Board. On 10&nbsp;September&nbsp;2010, Imperial filed
            a complaint regarding the Tariffs. The Board then established the
            RH-1-2011 public hearing to examine the Tariffs. Taking into account
            all the evidence submitted during the hearing, the Board found that
            the tolls as per the tariff filings are just and reasonable and not
            unjustly discriminatory or an impediment to access service on the
            pipeline. The Board noted that it has an ongoing obligation to make
            sure that tolls are just and reasonable throughout the life of a
            pipeline. The Board also noted that it has a role to play in
            providing stakeholders with regulatory certainty with respect to
            toll design when such was the basis for the investment, and that
            regulatory certainty is an important factor in the Board’s
            decision-making processes.

          <h4><em>Northwest Mainline Expansion Project</em></h4>
          <p>
            On 28&nbsp;February&nbsp;2012 the NEB approved the Northwest
            Mainline Expansion Project submitted by NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.
            (NGTL). The project includes the construction and operation of three
            new natural gas pipeline loops totaling 111.2&nbsp;kilometres (km)
            in northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta. The pipeline
            loops would be alongside existing rights-of-way (RoW) and will link
            natural gas supplies from the Upper Peace River area to markets in
            Canada and the United States. The Board accepted NGTL’s submission
            that there is adequate market demand for the gas to be transported
            by the project. The NEB’s approval was contingent on conditions that
            NGTL must meet with respect to pipeline integrity, the protection of
            the environment, the protection and monitoring of caribou habitat,
            and matters of public and Aboriginal consultation. A two-day public
            hearing was held in Fort Nelson, British Columbia in November
            of&nbsp;2011.

          <h4><em>Leismer to Kettle River Crossover Project</em></h4>
          <p>
            On 21&nbsp;June&nbsp;2012 the NEB approved an application for the
            Leismer to Kettle River Crossover submitted by NOVA Gas Transmission
            Ltd. (NGTL), with reasons for its decision to follow. The project,
            located about 90&nbsp;kilometres south of Fort McMurray, Alberta,
            consisting of approximately 77&nbsp;kilometres of new pipeline and
            related facilities, of which about 29&nbsp;kilometres are contiguous
            with existing pipeline right-of-way.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the oral public hearing held in Fort McMurray, the main
            concerns focused on Aboriginal and environmental issues. The panel
            also heard evidence dealing with other issues such as the need for
            and the economic feasibility of the proposed facilities and the
            suitability of the facilities design. This approval was conditional
            upon NGTL being able to demonstrate that all 22&nbsp;conditions
            imposed by the Board have been met. These conditions included
            mitigation requirements for the protection of the environment and
            additional requirements specifically for the protection of caribou.
            The sweet gas pipeline has been designed for an initial capacity of
            approximately 27.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;m&sup3; (972&nbsp;MMcf/d) and
            is scheduled to be in operation around April&nbsp;2013.

          <p>
            On 27&nbsp;July&nbsp;2012 the NEB approved an application by
            Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) to reverse the flow on a segment
            of its Line&nbsp;9 pipeline (the project), subject to certain
            conditions. Enbridge applied to reverse approximately
            194&nbsp;kilometres of Line&nbsp;9 between the Sarnia Terminal (at
            Sarnia, Ontario) and the North Westover Pump Station (near Hamilton,
            Ontario) to flow in an eastward direction. The project involves
            infrastructure additions and modifications at four existing sites
            along the pipeline segment. The Board undertook a public hearing
            process, the oral portion of which took place in London, Ontario.
            During the public hearing process, the Board heard concerns from
            parties regarding the integrity of the pipeline and impacts
            resulting from any possible accidents or malfunctions. The Board’s
            approval imposed 15 conditions on Enbridge, mainly to address issues
            related to pipeline integrity.

              The NEB’s Chair and CEO has also established standard time limits
              for certain future project applications affected by the changes to
              the NEB Act in order to provide even greater clarity and certainty
              to both applicants and the public. All applications filed with the
              Board since 6&nbsp;July&nbsp;2012 have met or are on track to
              meeting legislated time limits. The Board remains committed to
              timely consideration of all applications.

              CEAA&nbsp;2012 - Changes to Environmental Assessments (EA)
            </h3>
            <p>
              The NEB assesses and considers environmental impacts of all
              facility projects, as well as seismic and drilling applications.
              The proposed location and type of project determines which
              environmental assessment processes are used when conducting the
              assessment. An EA may also be required by one or more of the
              following: the NEB Act, the CEAA&nbsp;2012, the MVRMA, the
              <em>Inuvialuit Final Agreement</em> or the
              <em>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For projects designated under CEAA&nbsp;2012, the NEB will conduct
              an environmental assessment pursuant to that Act. For projects not
              designated under CEAA&nbsp;2012, the NEB will continue to conduct
              an environmental assessment as a part of our public interest
              mandate under the NEB Act. CEAA&nbsp;2012 allows the Board to
              continue to undertake high-quality EAs, while reducing unnecessary
              duplication in processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Federal departments may choose to participate in NEB public
              hearings for major pipeline projects as government participants or
              intervenors. For projects designated under CEAA&nbsp;2012, the NEB
              may also request a Federal Authority, such as the Department of
              Fisheries and Oceans or Environment Canada, to provide expert
              advice during an EA.

              well, changes to the <em>Fisheries Act</em> will allow for
              delegation of fisheries responsibilities to the NEB through the

            monitors Canadian supply and demand of all energy commodities
            including oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and electricity. The
            NEB also reports on specific energy issues, holds public inquiries
            where appropriate, and monitors current and future supplies of
            Canada’s major energy commodities.

          <p>
            In&nbsp;2012, the American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
            price of crude oil averaged approximately US$94 per barrel. Brent,
            the leading global price benchmark, averaged approximately US$112
            per barrel. Western Canadian Select (WCS), a blend of Canadian heavy
            and bitumen crude oils with sweet synthetic and condensates,
            averaged approximately $73 per barrel. Edmonton Par (a light crude
            oil similar in quality to WTI) averaged approximately $86 per
            barrel. The prices for WCS and Edmonton Par crude oils are primarily
            based in the U.S. upper Midwest market, adjusted for quality and
            transportation costs from one of the two major Alberta hubs,
            Hardisty or Edmonton.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img

              class="pull-right brdr-tp brdr-rght brdr-bttm brdr-lft mrgn-lft-lg"
            />Historically, the WTI-Brent differential was mainly a consequence
            of differences in transportation and crude oil quality. In
            January&nbsp;2011, the WTI-Brent differential began to widen and
            by&nbsp;2012, it averaged approximately US$18 per barrel. This was
            primarily due to significant supply growth in western Canada and the
            U.S. midcontinent, coupled with a pipeline system essentially
            operating at capacity. As a consequence, there were considerable
            constraints to move crude oil through Cushing, Oklahoma, the pricing
            point for WTI.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, supply uncertainty caused mainly by geopolitical issues
            in the Middle East drove WTI oil prices to US$106 per barrel in the
            spring of&nbsp;2012. As the year progressed, concerns about the
            state of the global economy, influenced by Europe’s weak economic
            recovery, reduced the WTI price of oil to approximately US$82 per
            barrel.
          </p>

            The decrease in WTI prices has affected other grades of oil
            including WCS and Edmonton Par. In&nbsp;2012, the WTI-WCS
            differential averaged approximately $21 per barrel. Similarly, the
            WTI- Edmonton Par differential averaged approximately $8 per barrel.

            Canada is a net crude oil exporter and the number one supplier of
            crude oil to the U.S. As seen in Figure&nbsp;9, in&nbsp;2012, total
            Canadian crude exports averaged approximately 2.3&nbsp;MMb/d, which
            is a year-on-year increase of roughly eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.
            In&nbsp;2012, the total value of crude oil exports and imports is
            estimated at approximately C$70.7&nbsp;billion and
            C$28.1&nbsp;billion, respectively. Based on imports of 700 hundred
            thousand barrels of oil per day, it is estimated that if Edmonton
            Par crude oil were used, instead of the higher priced Brent crude,
            the total costs of imports in&nbsp;2012 would have been lower by
            C$6.6&nbsp;billion.

            Natural gas prices (NYMEX) averaged US$2.79/MMBtu in&nbsp;2012,
            31&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent below&nbsp;2011 (US$4.04/MMBtu). Natural gas
            in&nbsp;2012 traded in a range of US$2.04/MMBtu to US$3.70/MMBtu.
            In&nbsp;2012, gas prices continued to be influenced by the increased
            availability of gas from unconventional sources, notably shale gas,
            as well as storage inventories and above average weather patterns.

            (8.6&nbsp;Bcf/d), one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent below&nbsp;2011 exports of
            246.5&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (8.7&nbsp;Bcf/d). In&nbsp;2012,
            pipeline imports averaged 79.3&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
            (2.8&nbsp;Bcf/d), slightly higher than&nbsp;2011 imports of
            76.5&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (2.7&nbsp;Bcf/d). Liquefied
            natural gas (LNG) imports averaged 4.8&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d
            (0.17&nbsp;Bcf/d), 47&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent below 2011 imports of
            9.1&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>m&sup3;/d (0.32&nbsp;Bcf/d) (Figure&nbsp;10).
            The estimated value of net gas exports for&nbsp;2012 is
            C$5.14&nbsp;billion, a 38&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent drop compared
            to&nbsp;2011, resulting from significantly lower natural gas prices
            and somewhat increased imports.

            In&nbsp;2012, net exports of electricity increased by
            32&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from&nbsp;2011 levels as seen in
            Figure&nbsp;11. Exports rose by 13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, but the
            growth in net exports is mostly attributable to the
            32&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent drop in imports. The largest declines in
            imports were observed in British Columbia, where high water levels
            increased the availability of hydroelectric supply, and Ontario,
            which has experienced periods of surplus baseload generation over
            the past few years. Total exports in&nbsp;2012 were about
            59&nbsp;TW.h, worth approximately $2&nbsp;billion. Despite rising
            exports, revenues from exports fell slightly in comparison
            to&nbsp;2011. Imports in&nbsp;2012 were about 11&nbsp;TW.h,
            purchased for about C$209&nbsp;million.

            Electricity prices vary across Canada, largely due to the cost of
            resources available to generate electricity. Prices are lowest in
            the provinces dominated by hydro generation (e.g.,&nbsp;Quebec,
            Manitoba and British Columbia) and higher in provinces with mainly
            thermal generation, including nuclear power (e.g.,&nbsp;Nova Scotia,
            Ontario, Alberta). In&nbsp;2012, average prices in most North
            American wholesale power markets dropped to a five-year low which
            led to the decline in export revenues.

            amended Part&nbsp;VI (Exports and Imports) of the NEB Act
            streamlining the NEB’s review of oil, gas and electricity export and
            gas import applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearings for export and import licences are no longer mandatory
            under section&nbsp;118 of the NEB Act. For oil and gas exports, the
            NEB Act’s criteria focuses assessment of licence applications on
            ensuring the quantity of oil or gas to be exported does not exceed
            the surplus remaining after due allowance has been ma+de for the
            reasonably foreseeable Canadian requirements. For electricity, the
            amendments to the NEB Act mean that the criteria to consider
            electricity export licence applications will be: fair market access,
            the effect of the export on provinces other than that from which the
            electricity is to be exported, and considerations specified in the
            <em

          <p>
            As a result of these changes, the Board will review and update
            related regulations for licence assessment processes to ensure they
            are consistent with the changes to the NEB Act.

            The Board takes pride in its technical and professional excellence
            as a regulator, and strives to attract, retain and develop highly
            qualified staff to work in a dynamic, results-based culture of
            excellence. Employees are our most valued resource and we depend on
            them to make our goals a reality. In our People Strategy, we commit
            to providing the following value proposition to staff:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              interesting and challenging work in the national public interest;

            The National Energy Board is committed to employment equity and

            role in attracting and retaining talented employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past few years, the Board has enhanced employment equity and
            diversity programs and activities. This included re-establishing the
            Employment Equity and Diversity Committee. This committee has
            developed and is leading implementation of the Employment Equity

            (the NEB is a four time winner as we were also named in&nbsp;2009).
            In addition to that honour we were also named as one of Canada’s
            Top&nbsp;100 Family Friendly Employers for&nbsp;2013, a designation
            that recognizes employers offering progressive and forward-thinking
            programs for employees with young children, other dependents, and/or
            family responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board is again excited to receive these honors as they showcase
            not only the types of programs offered to employees; they also focus
            on the employees themselves. The NEB is not just a Top&nbsp;100

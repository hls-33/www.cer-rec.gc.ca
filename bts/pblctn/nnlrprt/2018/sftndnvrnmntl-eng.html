                        mandate, as well as through Board directions and orders.
                        Companies must fulﬁl any commitments they make in their
                        submissions to the NEB, throughout all phases of
                        regulatory oversight.

                        The NEB holds its regulated companies accountable
                        against these expectations using a rigorous compliance
                        veriﬁcation and enforcement program, and through
                        enforcement actions. We require regulated companies to
                        anticipate, manage, and mitigate any potential threats
                        to safety and the environment that may occur through the
                        full lifecycle of their facilities.

                        The NEB always aims to achieve zero incidents that harm
                        people or the environment on the 73,000 km that we
                        regulate. The NEB takes every incident very seriously.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And, when activities pose greater harm to people or the
                        environment, we focus attention and increased regulatory
                        oversight through inspections, investigations and
                        audits. Where non-compliances are observed through
                        compliance veriﬁcation activities (CVAs), the NEB uses
                        enforcement actions to achieve company compliance as
                        quickly and as effectively as possible. This reduces
                        hazards and protects the safety of workers, the public,
                        the environment and property.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The NEB has seen an increase in the number of incidents
                        that harm people and the environment with the total
                        numbers rising from 19 in 2017&ndash;18 to 25 in
                        2018&ndash;19. The biggest proportion of the 25
                        incidents that harm were a total of 12 serious injuries,
                        mainly to construction workers. Similarly, the biggest
                        increase year&ndash;over&ndash;year was also in serious
                        construction worker injuries, which went from 7 to 12.

                      <p>
                        The NEB reviews every serious incident and identiﬁes
                        root causes. The learnings inform our inspections and
                        our oversight programs. As a result of reviews of these
                        serious injuries the NEB has increased our oversight of
                        constructions projects and in particular third party
                        contractors.

                      <p>
                        The NEB has identiﬁed that the majority of serious
                        injury incidents involve third-party contractors. To
                        that end, the NEB conducted pre-construction audits,
                        such as our audit in advance of the Keystone XL Pipeline
                        construction, with a focus on contractor oversight. The
                        NEB undertook compliance and enforcement activities
                        related to serious injuries in addition to following up
                        on every incident. This included inspectors visiting the
                        ﬁeld to observe ﬁrsthand how the companies conduct
                        incident response. Over 2018&ndash;19, the NEB conducted
                        23 ﬁeld inspections directly related to worker safety,
                        including eight on Enbridge Line 3.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The NEB also has a Serious Injury and Fatality Team that
                        is convened when any serious injury is reported to
                        the NEB. This team consists of a number of safety
                        experts who assess the incident to determine whether the
                        NEB needs to take any immediate actions. We are also
                        reaching out to other industries and regulators to share
                        learnings and approaches that can help reduce serious
                        injuries to workers.

                        <p>
                          The NEB has heard from companies that they do not
                          always understand how to interpret some regulatory
                          requirements. In addition, because NEB audits are
                          typically not done on the same company each year, it’s
                          not obvious to the broader regulated industry what the
                          NEB is ﬁnding year&ndash;over&ndash;year. The NEB is
                          committed to making changes to communicate more
                          effectively with companies and the public.

                        <p>
                          The NEB has issued information advisories over the
                          past three years that outline key gaps and ﬁndings
                          from our management system audits. The goal of these
                          advisories is to:

                          <li>
                            provide clarity regarding the NEB’s expectations, to
                            guide consistent interpretation of regulations going
                            forward; and,

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                          Sharing NEB’s audit information broadly allows
                          companies to get a better understanding of ﬁndings
                          and, as a result, understand NEB regulations and
                          expectations better.

                          This will in turn decrease the potential for harms to
                          occur. The NEB intends to revisit the audit ﬁndings we
                          communicate to companies and measure whether they are
                          repeated, not just among the audited organizations,
                          but among all companies.

                          beliefs, which a particular group of people shares
                          with respect to risk and safety”.

                          The workshop objectives were to promote learning and
                          sharing across NEB regulated companies and between the
                          NEB and regulated companies to improve our collective
                          performance. Participants noted that evaluating and
                          monitoring contractor and sub&ndash;contractor safety
                          culture is a challenge associated with broader
                          industry safety culture advancement. Other industries
                          and jurisdictions have identiﬁed similar issues and
                          developed related strategies and recommendations,

                      <h2>Damage Prevention: Reducing Potential for Harm</h2>
                      <p>
                        Unauthorized activities (UAs) or “Near misses” are a
                        leading indicator of areas and activities where harm
                        could occur, and tracking them provides the NEB with
                        additional insight on areas of greater risk so that we
                        can take targeted action.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Over 2018&ndash;19, the number of UAs reported dropped
                        by just over 16%, from 276 to 231. Assessing each
                        reported UA, and in particular ground disturbances,
                        provides the NEB with valuable information on how to
                        further support safe digging practices.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Education and awareness remain the best defense against
                        unauthorized activities, and the NEB’s Damage Prevention
                        team drove improvements in reporting results through
                        focused engagement with stakeholders and industry,
                        including:

                          UAs. This led them to make signiﬁcant changes to their
                          planning and ground disturbance processes, and neither
                          has had a UA since;

                          activities, and damages that previously had not met
                          the reporting threshold. This has enabled better

                      <h2>Managing Emergencies</h2>
                      <p>
                        Pipeline ruptures are rare. On average there have been
                        0.02 ruptures per 1,000 km of NEB regulated pipeline
                        over the past five years. Of these, five out of a total
                        of six ruptures reported to the NEB were natural gas or
                        natural gas liquids. In all cases, the NEB’s Emergency
                        Management program stands ready to take quick action by
                        deploying staff or standing up its Emergency Operations
                        Centre (EOC).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In October 2018, a natural gas pipeline operated by
                        Enbridge Pipelines ruptured just outside of Prince
                        George, BC. No injuries were reported, and community
                        members from the nearby Lheidli T’enneh First Nation
                        were evacuated as a precaution.

                      <p>
                        The NEB has an established Memorandum of Understanding
                        with the BC Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC). This allowed
                        BCOGC field staff to represent the NEB at the company’s
                        Incident Command Post (ICP) prior to the deployed NEB
                        field staff arriving on site, enabling a faster, more
                        efficient initial response. In the meantime, the NEB
                        activated its EOC in Calgary. Field staff were deployed
                        to the site to attend the company’s ICP in Prince George
                        and inspect the site once it was safe to access.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Engagement Specialists were also deployed to Prince
                        George to liaise with the affected First Nations
                        communities and other stakeholders. NEB inspectors
                        issued an Inspection Officer Order (IOO) that required
                        that the company meet specific measures before
                        restarting the line or any adjacent lines.

                        During these types of events, the NEB shares
                        jurisdiction with the Transportation Safety Board (TSB).
                        The TSB has the jurisdiction to determine the root cause
                        and contributing factors. The NEB is participating in
                        this investigation and will take actions to ensure the
                        ongoing protection of the public and the environment.

                        amended the NEB Act by introducing a $1 billion absolute
                        liability level to pipeline companies with the capacity
                        to transport greater than 250,000 barrels of oil per

                        Regulations were passed. These regulations set out
                        absolute liability limits for all other NEB regulated
                        pipeline companies. The regulations came into force in
                        2019, and going forward all NEB&ndash;regulated pipeline
                        companies must maintain financial resources equal to
                        their respective absolute liability limits, or a greater
                        amount if determined by the NEB.

                      <p>
                        To support this, the NEB developed guidance outlining
                        what companies should demonstrate for meeting the
                        financial resource requirements in the NEB Act and the
                        regulations, as well as a schedule for companies to
                        submit Financial Resource Plans. The draft guidance was
                        provided for both regulated company and public comment
                        in February and March 2019. The input received enabled
                        the NEB to provide greater clarity in the guidance,
                        which was subsequently released at the end of March
                        2019.

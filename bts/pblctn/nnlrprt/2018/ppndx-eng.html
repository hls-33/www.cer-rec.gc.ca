<h2 id="a5">Appendix E: Safety Orders</h2>
<p>There were no new safety orders issued in 2018&ndash;19.</p>
<p> Many Safety Orders will remain in effect for several years and staff continue to monitor them. The existence of a Safety Order in many cases establishes and imposes safe thresholds for continued operation (e.g. pressure restrictions). It is necessary to keep these restrictions in place until such time the Board is of the opinion that the company has sufﬁciently addressed underlying issues.</p>

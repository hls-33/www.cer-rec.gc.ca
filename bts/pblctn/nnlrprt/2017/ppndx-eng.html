<p><strong>M&amp;NP Load Retention Service</strong></p>
<p> On 22 January 2018, the Board denied an application from Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline (M&amp;NP) for approval of a new pipeline service and toll. M&amp;NP had offered a “load retention” service and discounted rate to Irving Oil in exchange for a 13-year commitment to use the M&amp;NP Pipeline to ship up to 68,579 gigajoules per day (GJ/d) of natural gas from the Canada/U.S. border in St. Stephen, NB to the Irving Oil Refinery and cogeneration facility in Saint John, NB. M&amp;NP said it offered the service to Irving Oil in response to a competing offer from the Emera Brunswick Pipeline. The Board turned down the application saying
that the application was premature. Please see the NEB’s website to read the complete decision (RHW-001-2017).</p>
<p><strong>M&amp;NP Tolls Settlement Application 2017-19</strong></p>
<p>On 1 March 2018, the Board issued a letter and Order approving Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline Management Ltd.’s application for approval of a 2017-19 toll settlement. Please see the NEB’s website to read the complete decision (TG-001-2018).</p>

<h2>Environmental Assessments</h2>
<p>For projects located on federal lands<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> , section 67 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA 2012) requires that before federal authorities make any decision that would allow a project to proceed, they must determine whether a project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. Under section 71 of CEAA 2012, the NEB is required, at the end of each fiscal year, to report to both Houses of Parliament on its activities under sections 67, 68 and 69 of CEAA 2012 during the previous fiscal year. </p>
<p>During the 2017-18 fiscal year, the NEB completed environmental assessments for two projects that are located on or that cross federal lands. In each case, the NEB determined that carrying out the project would not likely cause any significant adverse environmental effects and approved the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.</strong> s. 58 application to construction and operation - Ottawa Sales Meter Station Upgrade Project</p>

</blockquote>
<p id="fn1" style="font-size: 10px;">1 &ndash; The physical capacity of a pipeline is based on many factors such as the products being carried, direction of flow, pipeline pumping capacity, and maintenance work or other pressure restrictions. The actual physical capacity of the pipeline may, at times, be higher than the assumed operational capacity stated here.</p>

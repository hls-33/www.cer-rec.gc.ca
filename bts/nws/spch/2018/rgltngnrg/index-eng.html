            <p>
              Good afternoon. I’m pleased to be here today to present the
              National Energy Board’s perspective on regulating energy
              infrastructure in the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century. Over the past
              few years, you have undoubtedly heard about the NEB and the work
              we do. You may have read about us online, in a newspaper, or seen
              us on the news.
            </p>
            <p>
              And you likely have heard that the NEB is going through a
              modernization process, with the federal government recently
              introducing legislation that will bring forward a new
              environmental review process for major resource projects in
              Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              That legislation calls for the NEB to transition to a new
              organization named the Canadian Energy Regulator. And currently
              this legislation is working its way through Parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m going to talk about this change in a few minutes, but first, I
              want to tell you a bit about the NEB, give you some historical
              context, and then tell you about the work that we began several
              years ago to prepare for the changes we are facing, now and into
              the future.

              First, as Canada’s national energy regulator, the NEB is not just
              an organization that conducts pipeline hearings. The NEB is also
              mandated to regulate safety and environmental protection for over
              73,000&nbsp;km of interprovincial and international pipelines,
              which if laid end-to-end, would wrap around the earth nearly
              2&nbsp;times.
            </p>
            <p>We also regulate:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                about 1,400&nbsp;km of international and designated power lines;
              </li>
              <li>imports of natural gas; and</li>
              <li>exports of crude oil and natural gas liquids.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The NEB is a lifecycle regulator. We oversee a pipeline project
              from the application assessment phase, through to construction,
              operation, and eventual abandonment. Our work places us squarely
              in the midst of the most important public policy debates in
              Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              From pipeline safety, to controversial pipeline projects, to
              climate change policy and the transition to lower carbon energy
              systems…the NEB is in the middle of it all.

            <p>
              As Canada’s national energy regulator, a key aspect of the NEB’s
              mandate is to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                study energy matters over which parliament has jurisdiction;
              </li>
              <li>provide the government with advice on those issues; and</li>
              <li>deliver information to Canadians on energy matters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To give you an example of how seriously we take that
              responsibility, and how long we have been doing it, I want to
              share with you some historical context.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the slide behind me, you will see on the right, the NEB’s
              ‘Energy Futures Report 2017: Energy Supply and Demand Projections
              to 2040.’ This report was released last December. On the left, you
              will see the NEB’s original ‘Energy Supply and Demand Forecast
              Report,’ which was released about 50 years ago in 1967. These two
              documents &ndash; and all of the Energy Futures Reports that we
              published between 1967 and 2017 &ndash; are key reference points
              for energy experts, governments, and ordinary Canadians.
            </p>
            <p>
              And our 2017 Report remains the ONLY publicly available Canadian
              long-term energy outlook covering all energy commodities and all
              provinces and territories.

            <p>
              So &ndash; for your interest &ndash; I want to bring some
              historical context to this discussion by highlighting the NEB’s
              Energy Futures Report from 50&nbsp;years ago, and Energy Futures
              2017.
            </p>
            <p>This slide focuses on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>crude oil and natural gas liquids production;</li>
              <li>crude oil exports; and</li>
              <li>oil sands production.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              What you first notice about the slide is that all the numbers have
              all gone up in the past 50&nbsp;years. But what the slide also
              shows is that the NEB is still working on issues today that we
              were working on 50&nbsp;years ago; transporting resources to
              markets safely and ensuring that the public and the environment is
              protected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gas production has gone up significantly in the past
              50&nbsp;years. But in 1967, the issue was monetizing gas by moving
              it into the American marketplace. And today, while significantly
              more Canadian gas gets to the U.S. &ndash; there are still major
              issues of natural gas pipeline constraints that are being grappled
              with. In 1967, hydro accounted for the vast majority of
              electricity generated in Canada. Today, it’s a mix of hydro, other
              renewables and hydrocarbons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another interesting note from the 1967 report is that the issue of
              electrification of vehicles is mentioned &ndash; as well as
              concerns regarding coal emissions. And this is decades before
              these issues caught the imagination of the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, it’s a continuing story. We are working on issues that have
              been around since 1967, long before the term ‘NEB Modernization’
              was invented. And we will continue to work on them…long after the
              term ‘NEB Modernization’ is forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we are just at a different stage of evolution. So, let me
              tell you a bit more about what the NEB has been working on over
              the past few years in preparation for the latest change in our
              evolution.

              As you can imagine, regulating energy infrastructure in the
              21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century is increasingly challenging. And
              today, I believe that the context of energy regulation is more
              polarized than it has ever been.
            </p>
            <p>
              In their insightful 2017 report on the issues facing Canada’s
              energy system, Michael Cleland and Monica Gattinger point out that
              the key challenge facing regulators today is low public
              confidence.
            </p>
            <p>They attribute this challenge to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>social, value and technological change;</li>
              <li>policy gaps in climate change;</li>
              <li>reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples; and</li>
              <li>cumulative effects of energy development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In the middle of these issues, they say, is the energy regulatory
              process, which has been called upon to adjudicate on tough policy
              issues that actually require processes with explicit political
              accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Against a context in which society often distrusts authority and
              expertise, they continue, it is not surprising that many energy
              adjudication processes have become increasingly protracted and
              uncertain &ndash; and have failed the test of some public
              expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result &ndash; they say &ndash; outcomes may be contrary to
              the interests of Canada as a society, without necessarily
              satisfying communities, businesses or advocacy groups. In short,
              they believe that we are all losing.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the heart of the Board’s mandate is the public interest, which
              involves balancing society’s environmental, economic, and social
              interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              While having the flexibility to determine the public interest is
              important, we also recognize improvements to the lega
            </p>
            <p>
              l framework surrounding our adjudication processes and other
              issues of material importance, will help to deliver better
              outcomes for all Canadians. To that end, we fully support the
              Government of Canada’s modernization of the NEB. But we also
              understand that the challenges Cleland and Gattinger identify are
              system challenges that a regulator cannot resolve on its own.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what are we to do? First, grow a thick skin…and believe me, at
              the NEB, we have done that. Then we need to focus relentlessly on
              improving our oversight of industry performance on matters of
              safety and environmental protection. We also need to support and
              help inform the federal government on issues that should be
              considered for modernization.

            <p>
              I’ve already mentioned that the federal government has introduced
              legislation to modernize the National Energy Board and transition
              it to a new organization named the Canadian Energy Regulator.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been the biggest legislative change to the NEB since it was
              established in 1959. And I am pleased to say that it will provide
              much needed clarity for us, as we go forward.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Modern Governance</strong></p>
            <p>
              One of the biggest changes is the new Governance model proposed
              for the Canadian Energy Regulator. The new model will have a more
              conventional corporate-style governance board with an independent
              group of hearing commissioners.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is my hope that this change will help make the organization:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>more accountable;</li>
              <li>
                more predictable in ensuring its systematic performance; and
              </li>
              <li>
                it will raise the bar as we pursue our goal of regulatory
                excellence.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The new structure also ensures hearing commissioners are
              independent of governance of the organization and completely
              focused on pipeline adjudication matters. The new governance model
              &ndash; including the separation of roles for the Chair of the
              Governance Board, Lead Hearing Commissioner, and CEO disentangles
              the inherent conflicts between the various roles.
            </p>
            <p>It also enables:</p>

              The overall project assessment system will also benefit from a
              proactive focus on regional and cumulative effects.
            </p>
            <p>This proposed new system will focus on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Proactive strategic and regional assessments that would evaluate
                big-picture issues, like climate change, biodiversity, and
                species at risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would also examine the cumulative effects of development and
                provide context for individual impact assessments.
              </li>
              <li>
                This should lead to more focused assessment in certain areas,
                and coordinated monitoring of critical issues by all parties
                involved.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The CER will also work in partnership with the new Impact
              Assessment Agency of Canada &ndash; who will lead and steward all
              federal reviews of major projects.

              Canadians are increasingly interested in how energy projects are
              regulated throughout their lifecycle &ndash; from the initial
              design and construction, to the operation and eventual winding
              down of new resource projects. Our commitment to safety and
              environmental protection is unwavering and will benefit from
              updating our legal framework in a number of ways.

            <p>
              Now, let me turn to what the NEB has been doing to prepare itself
              for the future.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Departmental Results Framework</strong></p>
            <p>
              To be truly modern, a regulator must be accountable and report on
              its performance transparently &ndash; good or bad. Last year, the
              Board became an early adopter of the Government of Canada’s
              updated Policy on Results, known as the Departmental Results
              Framework (DRF). The DRF outlines our four core responsibilities
              (Energy Adjudication, Safety and Environment Oversight, Energy
              Information, and Engagement). It also establishes a suite of
              publicly reportable performance metrics for each core
              responsibility. We will begin reporting against this framework at
              the end of this fiscal year.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Management Systems</strong></p>
            <p>
              We require our regulated companies to have strong management
              systems in place and we have applied that thinking to our own
              internal workings. Our Management System, which we developed and
              began implementing in 2016, provides clear, appropriate core
              business processes for governance, business planning, performance
              assessment, and management of change on performance improvements
              to enable the organization to deliver the outcomes described in
              our DRF &ndash; rather than just a series of transactions over
              time. Relentless focus on organizational improvement is imbedded
              in our Management System by continually enforcing the “Plan, Do,
              Check and Adjust” cycle in everything we do. This focus is
              something that is often lacking in government and public bodies
              &ndash; as they lurch from issue to issue. By committing to a
              management system approach, and transparently reporting against
              our Results Framework &ndash; we aspire to excellence in our
              operations, and reject a transaction-based approach.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Accessible data and energy information</strong></p>
            <p>
              Another way we hope to improve public trust is through our focus
              on providing Canadians with access to our core data sets and
              unbiased factual energy and pipeline information. We believe that
              by giving the public the information that we have &ndash; and they
              need; they can dig into the data, come to their own conclusions,
              and be better at challenging our performance &ndash; rather than
              just accepting the NEB’s word for it. And as part of our efforts
              to support energy conversations, we have introduced a number of
              innovative information products.
            </p>
            <p>These include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                interactive pipeline safety map and pipeline performance
                dashboard;
              </li>
              <li>
                energy market snapshots (which provide short informative primers
                on energy issues every week); and
              </li>
              <li>interactive energy futures data visualizations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Comprehensive engagement with stakeholders</strong></p>
            <p>
              Over the past few years at the NEB, one of the main things we have
              learned is that we need to engage Indigenous Peoples,
              stakeholders, affected landowners, and the public much more
              effectively in order to sustain trust from Canadians. We have
              found that comprehensive engagement leads to better outcomes, and
              doesn’t need to conflict with ensuring fairness to all parties in
              an adjudication setting. For example, early engagement with
              stakeholders in advance of an assessment or adjudication process
              can influence the shaping of the scope and design of the
              adjudication process that is then delivered fairly to all affected
              interests. We have also learned that we can utilize comprehensive
              engagement and consensus-based processes to influence the
              development of regulatory standards and policies that are then
              utilized in regulatory oversight.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Safety Culture</strong></p>
            <p>
              Fostering and supporting a culture of safety within the industry
              we regulate is an emerging area for us and another means by which
              the NEB is focused on excellence. The focus on safety culture has
              a long history in some industries, the airline industry is a good
              example. But our industry has only in recent years, begun to focus
              on and address safety culture. At its core, safety culture is the
              attitudes, norms, values, and beliefs which a particular group of
              people share with respect to risk and safety. A strong safety
              culture scrutinizes &ndash; as a normal business function &ndash;
              every decision it makes to ensure that risks are managed
              appropriately.

            <p>
              In terms of being proactive and preventing harm &ndash; a positive
              Safety Culture is the ultimate defense. It holds the promise of
              moving a company well beyond compliance with standards, and
              facilitating systemic influence on Safety performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we seek to positively influence industry’s safety culture, we
              must also consider how our own organizational values affect our
              decision-making and behaviors. For this reason, we have begun
              efforts to understand and evaluate our own internal culture for
              regulatory oversight.

            <p>
              Just as energy systems change and evolve, so do ways of regulating
              and ensuring accountability to Canadians. It’s a continuing story.
              And the NEB has been working on issues that have been around for
              the last 50 years. And we will continue to work on them…for very
              likely…the next 50 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe in a strong regulatory presence for the good of all
              Canadians, and you can see evidence of that through our:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>internal transformation efforts;</li>
              <li>adoption of a results-based performance framework;</li>
              <li>management systems implementation;</li>
              <li>accessible data and energy information;</li>
              <li>comprehensive engagement with stakeholders; and</li>
              <li>our focus on safety culture.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I believe these initiatives will serve the NEB, the new Canadian
              Energy Regulator, and ultimately all Canadians well in the future.

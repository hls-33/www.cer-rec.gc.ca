<h3 id="s2_1">Energy Regulation Program</h3>
<p>The Energy Regulation Program provides the regulatory framework under which the NEB carries out its mandate and achieves part of its strategic outcome. Specifically, it enables Canadian federally regulated energy infrastructure to be developed and supervised throughout its lifecycle. The regulatory framework includes components such as setting expectations for industry and others, monitoring and enforcing compliance with requirements, measuring performance of the NEB’s regulatory framework and focusing on continual improvement. The authority for this program is derived from the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act), the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGO Act), the Oil and Gas Operations Act (OGO Act), the Canada Petroleum Resources Act (CPR Act), the Canada Labour Code, the National Energy Board Damage Prevention Regulations – Authorizations (NEB DPR – Obligations) and the National Energy Board Damage Prevention Regulations – Obligations of Pipeline Companies (NEB DPR – Obligations of Pipeline Companies), and other associated regulations and guidelines. Energy regulation provides Canadians with safe, reliable and efficient energy supply.</p>

<p>Through this sub-program, the NEB makes informed decisions and recommendations on issues and applications related to energy development, energy infrastructure, energy transportation, energy trade and related activities. As an independent regulatory tribunal, the NEB actively involves those affected by its regulatory decisions through public hearings and other engagement activities.</p>
<p>The NEB verifies and enforces compliance with regulatory requirements and expectations such as those set out in the NEB regulations, and terms and conditions of approvals. The NEB conducts its monitoring and enforcement activities under eight regulatory implementation programs: integrity, emergency management, safety management, damage prevention, financial regulation, respecting rights and interests, security, and environmental protection. Through monitoring and enforcement, the NEB holds regulated entities accountable for results in the Canadian public interest. The public interest is inclusive of all Canadians and refers to a balance of economic, environmental and social considerations that changes as society’s values and preferences evolve over time.

<p><strong>Office of the Secretary Files</strong><br />
In the course of its programs and activities the NEB may accumulate personal information which is not contained in the specific personal information banks listed in this entry. Such information may include an individual's name, address, telephone number, or opinion on a specific matter. This data is stored as part of the general subject files and the records are not normally retrievable by the name of the individual or other identifier.</p>
<p>Such personal information is provided by individuals in requesting publications, general information, funds for projects they are conducting, or in providing their comments or opinions on various topics. To retrieve this type of personal information, the enquirer must state the specific subject matter of the correspondence, the name of the person, and the approximate date on which the correspondence was forwarded to the NEB. The retention periods for these classes of personal information are controlled by the record schedules of the general subject files in which they are stored.</p>
